0,1ggyhlk,AITA Monthly Open Forum November 2024: Thank You!,"#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

In the spirit of the month, we’d like to express our gratitude to our users for (almost) another year. Sure, it’s not always sunshine and lollipops, but overall, we still get to interact with some pretty cool people. It may be hard to believe, but not every Modmail we get is negative.

We have some that take the time to consistently report things that should be reported. In case anyone wants to remain anonymous, I’ll leave usernames out here, but we know who you are. Whether it’s the good faith reporting of trolls/AI posts, or consistently being on the lookout for the posts that involve minors and sexual content. We appreciate you.

I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention our Bot Hunters. We’ve noticed how consistent you are, and your accuracy is pretty spot on! We are truly grateful for your help in spotting those bots. Particularly on New Bot Hatching Days, where it seems a bunch just pop up all at once. If you’re interested in joining Team Bot Hunter, drop us a [ModMail message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole&subject=&message=)!

To those that celebrate Thanksgiving this month, enjoy! To those that are in parts of the world where it isn’t a thing (or if you really just don’t care), enjoy whatever it is you’re into!

1,1ghdesx,AITA for describing someone as ‘slightly overweight’?,"So, this is probably a really stupid post but I can’t get it out of my head. I’m autistic so idk if what I said was actually rude or not.
Anyways, I was at a clothes shop to get an exchange, but I didn’t have a receipt. I spoke to a worker that was on the shop floor, and she stated it was fine. Should probably state I spoke to that woman for like a max of 10 seconds.
So I went to the till and, when they said they couldn’t do it, I stated that one of the workers already said it was fine. And I described her as ‘slightly overweight’, as I’m really bad at remembering what people look like, facial blindness I think it’s called.
There was another worker who overheard and she had a similar body type. 
She said “Oh well that’s a bit rude.”
I felt really bad and tried to explain that I didn’t mean it like that and I don’t know what her face looked like. 
Nothing came of it, no fights or anything, but I just feel really bad even though I didn’t mean it in a rude way, and I can’t get the thought out of my head.

So, yeah, was I rude?

2,1ghd273,AITAH for being mad about my boyfriend sharing my medical information with amutual friend? ,"I (19f) have been together with my bf (m20) for around 2 years. We have a mutual friend I'll call Rachel. 

In the past my boyfriend shared private things about our relationship with her, which I was not comfortable with, but I let it go since everybody needs a person to vent to from time to time. 

Well I have repeated utis. I am not going to beat around the bush, the first one was 100% my fault and since I didn't get treatment right away my utis turned chronic and I'll be starting immunotherapy, since today I got my third one in the past six months. 

I told my bf because I was supposed to come to his house on sunday, but since I have a doctors appointment on monday I'll be staying home and come by after the appointment. Last night I barely slept because I had to get up to pee a lot and I was also in a lot of pain, but today I am feeling a lot better. 

Well for some reason my bf decided to share this information with Rachel, who than started texting me to go to the ER. I told her I've had multiple of these infections and I'll be fine to wait until monday morning, besides it's late in the evening and I am tired and don't feel like driving would be a good idea atm. She texted me since but I didn't reply. Nor am I replying to my bfs texts. 

When he shared our personal stuff about our relationship I was pissed but at the end of the day it's OUR relationship and I am not the only person who gets to decide who we talk to about it. But in what world did he think it was okay sharing MY private MEDICAL information with an outside person. He knows damn well I don't like talking about me having this condition and the first time I had it I was too embarrased to tell my parents so I just suffered for two weeks before actually getting treatment. And now my bf completely broke my trust and shared this with someone without my consent. 

It honestly makes me wonder how many people other than her he told without me knowing and makes me not want to meet his friends/family because of the embarrasement.

But at the same time I know he had good intentions and maybe wanted to ask Rachel for help since he didn't know what to do about my condition.

3,1ghct2v,AITA for inviting too many people to my baby shower,"I want to invite more people to my baby shower than I did to my wedding, but my husband thinks that it’s weird to invite people that didn’t get invited to the wedding because they may feel offended that we didn’t care enough to invite them to the wedding.

For context, we had a very small outdoor ceremony at a friends house. We paid for the wedding ourselves with minimal help from family, and that’s a very big part of why we didn’t invite more people.

4,1ghcghw,AITA for purposefully ignoring my sisters kids whenever we see each other?,"For starters, I don’t want anyone coming at me for being on this app. I know I shouldn’t be on here but I seriously need advice. 

I, 13F, have a half sister, 41F. She’s overall a sweet, hardworking person but is also pretty stern. She has four kids. 14M, 11F, 9M and 2F. The thing is, those little shits are wild. My eldest nephew vapes along with my eldest niece and 9M nephew. I don’t know where they get it from, but I know it’s wrong. From a young age they’ve been treating me like shit; hitting, punching, kicking, overall abuse until I told my primary school about it. Of course that didn’t do much as it led to further bullying. 

As the years passed, they have become less intense, but are still really horrible. Whenever my mother and I go visit them, I stay away from them, not wanting to participate in anything with them. 

As their aunt, I should have the higher authority over them, right? Wrong. They never listen. 14M is disgusting, spitting on a carpeted floor, picking his nose, other things like that. He swears directly to his own mother and father too. As for the younger ones, they’re too afraid to do such bold things. 

9M’s birthday was somewhere in September. My mum knows I hate going to their place so she called them to let them know we won’t be attending because I’m ‘sick’. 
After a couple days, 9M called me and asked if I faked being sick to avoid them. He proceeded to call me a bitch for ignoring his texts. 

In the middle of October was my mother’s birthday. We live in a two bedroom flat so there’s not much space to avoid them. The funny thing is, whenever we first see each other at a gathering, they appear to be chill and nonchalant about stuff before turning into the devil. I still try to avoid them as much as I can, but I feel really bad for not spending my time with family. It’s just me and my mum, so they often rip on me for being fatherless. I am also quite overweight for my age, but it’s not very visible, but they laugh at me for being fat and stuff. 

I just want to know if I’m the asshole for not doing anything with them. The only bearable kid from my sister is 2F. She’s a sweetheart although I can see her siblings behaviour and actions rubbing off on her.  

Once again, sorry for being on this app at my age, I just needed to get things off my chest because they really are a handful.

We started dating in April of this year and my bio mom (Janet) was actually all for this and was happy for us... At first but when me and him started growing closer together she started getting jealous because I was spending my time with him, i was going to church (he was giving her gas money so i could go) and she hated it she is the type to not take you some place just because she didnt want to, and it was difficult on the both of us.

Now me and Janet were fighting everyday almost about my now fiance and it was a week after mine and his two month anniversary she kicked me out and told me ""if you want to be a fucking adult than you need to pack my shit and leave"" then after she kicked me out she left me with my nephew (4) and i packed some of my things loaded the car with my now fiance and i told him i wasnt going to leave until they came back because my nephew was still in the house and there was a group of us and one of the people (50f) decided to call the cops and so we left with her and another person there because I knew what Janet was capable of.

Now fast forward to the 4th of July my fiance popped the question under the fireworks it was just me and him and there was no ring but that didnt matter, I said yes and am now planning the wedding and I have started making a list of people who won't be allowed in the wedding and she is the main person she put me through hell, I was her built in maid and babysitter for my nephew she doesn't even know about the wedding but I'm worried that when she finds out she will try to show up

7,1ghbsxs,AITA for not staying home from my Eras Tour stop because my SIL’s mom died?,"I am currently on my flight to Indianapolis to see the Eras tour on Saturday. I bought tickets last year and have been booked and ready with my outfit, friendship bracelets, etc. I have been looking forward to this so much as someone who has been a fan since Red.

My SIL Grace told the family last night that her mom died. This is truly heartbreaking, I lost my Dad when I was 20 so I do understand. I went over after work to be with them and also did their laundry for them and fixed them dinner. Before I left I prepared a bunch of wraps to eat and some casserole as well, I was there until 2am and have barely slept.

I got a call this morning from Grace asking if I could come over and spend the morning with her. I told her that unfortunately I had a few things I had to do before I could leave for my concert. She got very quiet and asked me if I was still going to that. I told her yes, I leave in 5 hours for the airport. 

She said that she couldn’t believe I could still think about a concert when she has just become an orphan with no one in the world but our family (which is true). 

I told her that I am so sorry, and that when I get back I will take off a few days to be with her if she needs. But that this is something I have been looking forward to and also my friends coming with me are counting on me for things like the hotel, rental car, etc.

She got angry and told me that I was a horrible sister in law and that she hopes when my mom dies, everyone abandons me, too. I know this is the shock and grief talking so I am truly not mad at her, when my Dad died I said some pretty chaotic things too. But as I’m sitting on this flight I feel so bad.

8,1ghawaf,"AITA, or am I just a middle child?","Hi guys

27, F

I’ve had to move back home because my tenancy agreement ended and I’m in the process of buying a house. I had to bring my cat with me (who uses a human toilet, so no litter)

Currently at home are my two parents, and older brother

- my older brother is unemployed
- I’m the middle child

Okay, AITA:

- we have two showers, one new one and one really really old moldy one. My mum and my brother use the new one. I’m not allowed to use this one (my brother banned me because all his expensive products are there (and I guess he thinks I’ll use them, idk) and my parents don’t conflict with my bro at all) I have to shower only when/if he leaves the house as the moldy old shower makes my scalp itch. Sometimes I go days without showering because he doesn’t leave the house. When he does leave the house my mum hurries me in the shower and then goes in and wipes the surfaces so he doesn’t know I used it 

- my mum buys my brother an entire pineapple, apple and carrots every single day (he juices fresh juice daily, which he shares with to my parents). I’ve never been offered this (nor am I particularly interested). My parents then hand wash his (very complicated to wash) juicer. My parents don’t buy me any groceries (not even coffee, I buy my own groceries down to soap etc)- when we eat out, it’s automatically expected that I’d pay for everybody (which I do), and then my mum pays for a takeaway for my brother (like bruh instead of getting a takeaway for him pay for your share??). Like everytime we go out for coffee, food, anything, it’s automatically assumed I pay for everybody (which I do)

- I needed to stay the night at my younger sister’s (she lives close to my work) and my sis and had an argument (neither of my parents were there). I really wanted to shower at her house but I ended up booking a hotel for the night as the argument got really bad. When I came home my parents didn’t speak to me for a week because we argued (they took her side even though they weren’t there, I told them you don’t have to be on my side I didn’t ask you to be on my side, but you don’t have to *automatically* assume I’m wrong either). My parents screamed at me almost daily for this.

- I’m a huge people pleaser, and I’m constantly spending loads and loads of money to please my parents and sister (I bought all their phones all new iPhones etc)

- I’m not allowed to even let my cat roam around the house, so he stays in my bedroom and I pick him up, take him to the toilet, take him back to my bedroom. Poor little guy meows at my bedroom door constantly throughout the night and I can’t open the door for him

- every week my mum is like have you heard from the solicitor, when are you moving etc (she really didn’t want me to move back home either)

- my mum makes dinner for my dad and a special (gluten free, seed oil free etc) dinner for my brother, and nothing for me. I run out daily to the grocery shop to buy a ready meal everyday

27, F

I’ve had to move back home because my tenancy agreement ended and I’m in the process of buying a house. I had to bring my cat with me (who uses a human toilet, so no litter)

Currently at home are my two parents, and older brother

- my older brother is unemployed
- I’m the middle child

Okay, AITA:

- we have two showers, one new one and one really really old moldy one. My mum and my brother use the new one. I’m not allowed to use this one (my brother banned me because all his expensive products are there (and I guess he thinks I’ll use them, idk) and my parents don’t conflict with my bro at all) I have to shower only when/if he leaves the house as the moldy old shower makes my scalp itch. Sometimes I go days without showering because he doesn’t leave the house. When he does leave the house my mum hurries me in the shower and then goes in and wipes the surfaces so he doesn’t know I used it 

- my mum buys my brother an entire pineapple, apple and carrots every single day (he juices fresh juice daily, which he shares with to my parents). I’ve never been offered this (nor am I particularly interested). My parents then hand wash his (very complicated to wash) juicer. My parents don’t buy me any groceries (not even coffee, I buy my own groceries down to soap etc)- when we eat out, it’s automatically expected that I’d pay for everybody (which I do), and then my mum pays for a takeaway for my brother (like bruh instead of getting a takeaway for him pay for your share??). Like everytime we go out for coffee, food, anything, it’s automatically assumed I pay for everybody (which I do)

- I needed to stay the night at my younger sister’s (she lives close to my work) and my sis and had an argument (neither of my parents were there). I really wanted to shower at her house but I ended up booking a hotel for the night as the argument got really bad. When I came home my parents didn’t speak to me for a week because we argued (they took her side even though they weren’t there, I told them you don’t have to be on my side I didn’t ask you to be on my side, but you don’t have to *automatically* assume I’m wrong either). My parents screamed at me almost daily for this.

- I’m a huge people pleaser, and I’m constantly spending loads and loads of money to please my parents and sister (I bought all their phones all new iPhones etc)

- I’m not allowed to even let my cat roam around the house, so he stays in my bedroom and I pick him up, take him to the toilet, take him back to my bedroom. Poor little guy meows at my bedroom door constantly throughout the night and I can’t open the door for him

- every week my mum is like have you heard from the solicitor, when are you moving etc (she really didn’t want me to move back home either)

- my mum makes dinner for my dad and a special (gluten free, seed oil free etc) dinner for my brother, and nothing for me. I run out daily to the grocery shop to buy a ready meal everyday

Me being back home has made me feel like a black sheep. Nobody (not my sister or my bro) put in 5% the effort I put in, and yet I feel so isolated, alone? I feel turned off from even talking to my sister (we were close friends before I moved back home).

9,1ghaqdw,AITAH for decorating for Christmas when my daughter isn't home?,"First off, don't come at me for decorating early lol. It's how it's always been, we decorate for Christmas on November 1st or the first weekend of November. We're not a big fan of Thanksgiving in this house, but huge Christmas nuts and we like enjoying our decor for more than a few weeks. Plus we live where it's very cold and we've already had snow 😂

My 13 year old has a tournament with her travel team this weekend. I am not going as I'm staying home with her little siblings. We all decided it was best. She and husband can go and she gets all the focus of one parent. She can bond with her team, not worry about the littles kicking off, and we all don't have to share a tiny hotel room for 2 nights. The littles don't have a crazy schedule disruption, 8 hours of car travel, and won't distract from their sister. They will be gone the entire weekend, leaving Friday after school, and won't come home until basically bedtime Sunday. 

It takes most of a day to decorate, and she generally is only interested in participating for the first hour. Then she usually scampers off to do her own thing. Otherwise it's a lot of staring at me wrapping garland and hanging up lights. I will leave the tree bare (we always hang ornaments as a family anyways). And she has her own tote and tree for her bedroom to decorate herself.

I know she likes the IDEA of decorating with me, and I would leave several pieces I know she enjoys finding places for, but I'd like to get the majority done this weekend while I'm home. Instead of sitting around with the littles  and then waiting for her to be done with school Monday and try and rush it all in the few hours before bedtime.

10,1ghao3t,AITA for telling my sister my support for her and my niece ends in January after I found out she has been lying?,"Will try to keep this brief since last post exceeded the character limit. 

My sister (25F) has a 4 year. The baby daddy is the run of the mill deadbeat. Does not work, avoids court appearances, lives with his mother, does not even have a state ID. 

I have been support my sister for 3 years, she was staying with our mom but something happened to her and she now lives in a retirement community so she does not have the same amount of space. 

My mom asked me to make sure my sister is okay she is the baby. I get it she was young and the father of her child played a good act. I do not blame her for that.

So I cover childcare, and rent for my sister. I will spot her when she needs other stuff like school supplies, food, clothes for my niece. She is a manager at Target. 

When she has to work late I will let my niece sleepover. I generally had pick ups because I get off at 5. She generally handles drop offs. I will take care of dinner and my sister handles bath and bed time. 

My mom recently let the cat out the bag that my sister is going to Europe on the 12th to the 17th. My sister told me she was going to FL for her HS friends wedding. She asked if I would be willing to handle watching my niece. I said sure because she has been working late putting in long hours at work. 

I pushed our mom and got the truth. She is seeing someone, has not told them she has a kid. He thinks my niece is my child and she helps me out from time to time. He has met my mom, she seems to like him. 

After I found out I confronted my sister, she apologized. I told her I don't care she has until January. She told me I was being cold and misogynistic. Since I told her if she wants to date as a single mother you have an obligation to be transparent with the people you are dating that you have a child. 

She said she can separate the two, and I told her no she cannot. She has a daughter you cannot lie and say she is my kid so you can have fun and not scare people off. I don't understand the dating scene, having a kid at 21 with another man that is not in the picture is a huge red flag. I told her so is lying about having a kid. 

This does not work either way. I asked does she plan to pretend her daughter is mine forever? She said I am like a father to my niece anyways. 

Am I the asshole here? I know this may get harder for my sister especially my niece without my support she cannot afford where she lives, she cannot afford daycare on Targets pay. My mom has told me I do what is best for my niece. She is afraid if she push my sister too much she will break down.

11,1ghahje,AITAH for keeping the leftover booze from a wedding?,"2 weeks ago my step-daughter got married. Her mother and I paid for most of it, the couple put in some. 

Her father is not well off, and recently lost his job, but he bought the  hard liquor to stock the bar. It was around $1000 of booze. We appreciated the contribution as it was significant for him.

We cleaned up after the wedding and took the leftover booze home.  We boxed it up to give back to him, but he says we should keep it.

The conflict is that my wife wants us to give him money for it all...  She feels bad for his situation having lost his job and he needs the money. I figure he didn't chip in much, relatively, for his daughter's wedding anyway, and we're trying to give it back to him. We don't need all this booze in the house but I'll keep it. He bought some silly stuff we'll never drink like big bottles of fireball and jager, and a $70 bottle of patron that wasn't even opened.

12,1ghagg8,AITA for how I responded to my date’s car wreck on the first date,"I scheduled a first date at a local restaurant. I arrived a couple minutes early, went inside, and ordered a drink. My date was running a couple of minutes late. Then I got a text from my date saying that she wrecked her car right outside of the restaurant. I told the staff that I’d be back to pay, and then I went outside to check on her. I greeted her, said I was really sorry she was in an accident, told her that I was grateful that she was okay, and told her that we could reschedule if necessary. She was uninjured and in good spirits. This is the first time I was meeting her and, at the time, she still had to deal with police, paramedics, insurance, and the tow truck.

13,1ghag01,AITA for refusing to go to the cemetery with my family ?,"Today is the Polish holiday for honoring the dead. It is strictly a Christian holiday. I (17M) have told my family many times that I am not christian and don't like some of the holidays. I still take part in very few of them like Christmas or Easter because I can spend time with some of my family that I like, but I avoid most of them mostly due to religious trauma as I am queer.

Today my mother woke me up by screaming at me that my family is waiting to go to the cemetery. I said I don't want to go. My hair is greasy and a mess, I haven't slept up until 8AM because my cat kept me up, I'm not religious and the whole situation would be uncomfortable for me. Because of that my mother got extremely mad and started screaming at me about how I have no respect dor the dead whatsoever. Personally, I think it is more disrespectful for me to go, since I wouldn't be praying, I'd be just standing there, over the grave, staring. It'd be extremely uncomfortable even if I didn't look awful, but that only added to it. 

Now my entire family is mad at me and probably won't want to talk to me for a bit, but I obviously still live with them since I'm a minor. I don't really know what to think. All of my friends dislike my family, but I have a hard time believing they're really that bad.

19,1gh9g8j,AITA for getting mad he smoked ,"I apologise for any mistakes, English is not my first language and I'm overly frustrated.

For context: I have been with my (f22) boyfriend (m22) for two years and a half. When we met, he was used to smoke during stressful periods such as exams... He asked if it bothered me and I said yes. I hate the smell, the taste, the everything. It reminds me of my abusive mother and it disgust me at a point where I get sick. He knows that, I repeated it multiples times while together and I don't let him get near me or kiss me of he smoked (he sometimes smokes during parties but never near me, he officially stopped). 

Few days ago, a close friend of his went to our city and stayed at my bf's house for two nights. I get along well with this friend and he's nice and funny. They both slept in my bf's room and spent some time there. Yesterday, they invited two other friends to play video games and spend the time together. They smoked inside some cigarettes during the night. Once I arrived at his house to stay for the weekend, the smell was evident. No big deal, just need to open a window and now it's getting better. What make me mad is that he didn't take the time, the interest or the respect to move my favourite plushie out of the smoke range. Now, it smells bad and I can't touch it anymore. He knows I love that plushie and that I use it to help me sleep since I have some trouble with it. I don't care if it's childish, I like it and it helps me avoid waking up multiple times during the night or having nightmares.

I know it's stupid to get mad over something so little. But my point is that he didn't care at all about me at any level and I can't get over how little respect he showed to the one he's supposed to love.

I'm so frustrated and mad that I started crying but I still feel guilty about it. So, AITA?

Little detail: I'm not a shouting/swearing kind of mad and I've never been. I usually stay by myself to understand how to properly open up about why I'm mad.

Living with James has been incredibly difficult for the past four years—there have been constant conflicts and outbursts that have deeply affected both me and my mom. Things got so bad that we even had to move to another country for a while just to escape the situation, but that didn’t work out, and we returned to Canada.

James has a history of creating chaos in the family. My oldest brother, ""Frank,"" who previously had to recover at home after surgery, ended up moving out and going no-contact with my mom because of disagreements related to James. Since then, I’ve been stuck at home dealing with the same problems: explosive arguments, threats, and emotional manipulation. My mom feels guilty and doesn't want to take drastic action against James, which has left me feeling trapped and exhausted.

After many failed attempts to convince my mom to set boundaries, I decided to focus on my own future. I found an opportunity to move to the U.S. where I have a job and a place to stay with a friend. This would be a fresh start for me, far away from the painful dynamics and judgments tied to my brother's behavior.

24,1gh932l,AITA walking away from my child?,"
I’m feeling overwhelmed and unsure about a choice. After battling with social services, my ex-partner, and my family, I’m at a point where I feel I can no longer fight for my child. I’m considering stepping away to focus on my own well-being, but it’s a painful decision that weighs heavily on my heart.

I dropped all court proceedings and wrote to the judge explaining I did not want a flight ban for my ex partner (she’s Spanish) after applying for a C100 as advised by social services who refused to help me contact my daughter. This was so my little girl could spend Christmas with my ex partners side of the family.

I explained I wanted to try and resolve matters amicably and moving forward, dragging my child through the courts would not be in her best interests or anyone elses. The Judge accepted my intentions for this but explained they would have to wait for a report from social services.

After very little interaction with my ex partner she stated I was harassing her for requesting a 5 minute video call and she needed to make me wait to prove a point.

I have not seen my daughter for months due to social services denying me access and my ex partner having precarious communication with myself and today I came to the decision that I am going to walk away.

To whom it may concern

I am writing to express my deepest regrets regarding my current situation and the difficult decision I have made concerning my child. This letter is not easy to write, as it comes from a place of profound sorrow and reflection.

Over the past months, I have faced numerous challenges that have taken an immense toll on my emotional and physical well-being. I have fought tirelessly against what feels like an unending battle with the authorities, my ex-partner, and my family, while simultaneously trying to justify my actions and decisions to everyone around me. Unfortunately, I have reached a point where I no longer possess the strength to continue this fight.
This decision to step away is not made lightly, nor does it come from a lack of love for my child. Rather, it stems from a realisation that my current circumstances prevent me from being the parent my child deserves. I believe that, for their well-being, it may be best for me to take a step back.

I am truly sorry for any pain or disappointment this may cause. I hope that, with the right support, my child can have a brighter future, surrounded by those who can provide the stability and care they need.
Thank you for your understanding during this challenging time. I appreciate all the efforts made by social services to support families like mine.

Sincerely,





Call me a useless piece of shit and a terrible father, God knows I deserve it.

But I am actually so relieved and I feel like I don’t want to hit my head against a wall anymore. I’m just going to live life and try to enjoy myself.

I just recently made my room pretty, like really pretty with all these decor on the wall and my room is clean, everything is in place but just earlier all of the kids are in my bedroom, which I don't mind cause there's adults and I was using the pc in a different room but when i came back. My room was crowded with adults and children's and when I saw the condition of my room.

I wanted to shout but I didn't. My things were everywhere, my decorations are ruined and even my jeweleries, they're important to me.

I snapped and walked out, I was pissed and started crying near the bathrooms and my sister asked ""why are you crying?"" And I explained that my things are missing and room is a mess and she just said ""just go in there and find your stuff"" which I did and found my jeweleries but I was still pissed off so because there's still a lot of my stuff that is missing (my wallpaper and decorations are ruined.)

After putting my jeweleries in a higher place, I walked out again.

27,1gh8tpn,AITA for not helping my mom makeup with my dad after a fight,"i (18f) have a complicated relationship with both my parents. from the past 10 years they’ve been in a long distance relationship. me being the only child for over a decade (they decided to have another kid when i was 14) have been both of theirs ‘emotional support animal’. 

my dad whenever visited town during vacation would often take me to long drives with him just venting about how hard it is being the only bread maker in the family and how my mom never understands him blah blah.

my mom would talk about her past but mostly how fucked up her relationship with my dad is. like for instance, she told me about the time he physically abused her in front of me when i was 3. i obviously resent my dad for it. he’s the shittiest husband but a pretty decent dad (he wants me to achieve my dreams and is literally paying my med school bills, starting this year). 

i’ve always encouraged my mom to get a divorce and how not only hers but also her kids mental health would be so much better if they get separated. i explained to her how alimony works and she could always go back to teaching if she wants the extra cash and go live in our farmhouse which is half an hour out of town. they end up making up, she always ends up going back to him, later im the bad guy for “talking shit about her husband” and my pep talk to her always goes down the drain. i’ve grown so tired of it. 

anyways, my dad has been home for about 2 months now and while i wasn’t home, they had a fight. idk what it was about but from what my brother (4) told me, there was just a lot of yelling. i didn’t bother asking either of them what it was about but from my dads snarky comments these past days, im guessing it has something to do with my mom’s sisters who hate my dad. and i understand their hatred towards him but after my mom meets up with them and picks fights with my dad, i have to be the one to deal with the heat. 

this time however, my mom was in the wrong and she knew it. she asked me to go explain my dad the situation and tell him that she’s sorry. i laughed in her face and asked if she’s serious. she said “why wouldn’t i be?”. i told her that you guys are literally living in the same house. why can’t you just go over to him and explain yourself. why do i have to be the one to do so. she said that i have always had a special bond with him being the eldest and only daughter and he’ll listen to me. i counter backed saying that she’s literally his wife for over 20 years and im sure he’ll understand her. 
now she’s pissed saying that i’ve always wanted them to break up and can’t even do this simple thing for her sake. i’ve always had empathy for her as a woman but as a daughter i’ve resented her for making me and my brother grow up in this toxic household.

she hasn’t been speaking to me when i told her her im driving back to college because coming home makes it hard when the adults in the house are acting like kids. i told my best friend about this and she told me it wasn’t that big a deal and i should just help them out. 

now i kinda feel guilty for blowing this whole thing out of proportion.

He was always calling me nicknames which I didn’t really want to be called, he was really nosy when once I was talking to my parents in a native language he was using Google translate camera mode to see what I was writing to them about, and whenever I visibly became angry and annoyed to something he did, he just laughed it off and just said ‘I was just joking!’. I’ve found it hard to even call him ‘a friend’ at points. In the second year and now, he is still quite annoying, but it’s less bad than he used to be (when I say less bad, that’s like 20% less bad than he was). He also is known for sending extravagantly long voice messages as well. Once, when going on a school trip, he sent me like a 20 minute long voice message which I spent most of the time on the bus there listening to and, honestly, thought I wasted my time as he was randomly yapping about the EU and how cars didn’t work or some baloney like that which we have never talked to each other before about. Now, just before going on holiday, I was talking to him a little and then he suddenly stopped. I saw he was sending a voice message.

31,1gh7tug,AITA for slamming my bfs friend’s door?,"So yesterday, Halloween, was the three year anniversary of my friends car crash. One of them passed away immediately, the other one was in the hospital for weeks. Anyway. I told my boyfriend that it was the 3 year anniversary, and he said “oh what did a memory pop up or something” nothing close to an “are you okay” ever came out of his mouth. 

Fast forward a couple hours. One of his friends picks us up to go get food. On the way back, he’s driving like a total asshole. Swerving in and out of traffic. Going 80 on an interstate entrance ramp. Screaming at people, etc. At some point I yelled at him to stop driving like an asshole because neither him or my boyfriend were wearing their seatbelts. 

When we finally get home, I got out of the truck and apparently slammed the door. I didn’t mean to, I was just trying to get inside before they saw me crying. I was so frustrated and scared. I flopped down on the bed and just cried. 

A couple minutes later, my boyfriend walks inside and asks what’s wrong, in a very annoyed tone. I didn’t answer at first because I don’t want to be *that* girlfriend that shit talks my bfs friends. So instead of sitting down, or actually acting concerned, he just started to yell at me. Saying that he could leave for the night and so on. He said he wanted to shower and didn’t want to deal with it (it as in me). 

Well, I feel like I need to add I live in his house. I knew he felt like I was disrespecting him, so I wasn’t going to disrespect him more by making him leave his own house. So I packed a bag to go to my parents for the night. He must’ve gotten out of the shower just as I left, because he texted me “did you seriously leave? So leaving’s the answer now?” I hadn’t made it far at all. I stopped at the gas station maybe 2 minutes from our house to get gas. He made me feel like I didn’t have a choice but to come back, so I did. 

By the time I got back (again maybe two minutes) he’s asleep and acts so bothered that i woke him up to talk.

32,1gh7ejm,AITAH for excluding one of my friends because he kept disrupting my plans to set up another friend? ,"So, I (23f) met my boyfriend David (24) two years ago and became close with his friends. David has two best friends, Marcus (24) and Tom (23). They go way back to high school, where they ran track together.

Marcus and Tom are completely different types of people. Marcus is more reserved, but Tom is the center of attention at parties and really outgoing. He also has had a lot of girlfriends, but we have given up on getting to know them as he always finds some reason to break up with them a day or two later.

So, a couple of weeks ago, I asked my boyfriend why I had never seen Marcus bring around any of his girlfriends. I was surprised when he told me he had never had a girlfriend. He also told me not to tell him I knew, as he is ashamed of it and is a very private person.

This surprised me because Marcus is a handsome, athletic guy. I also have never noticed him having any trouble socially; he is good friends with many people and is easy to hang out with. I told my boyfriend this, and he said that he gets anxious when approaching women and keeps making excuses not to.

So I told my boyfriend if I was going to try to set him up with one of my friends. I talked to a girlfriend I knew was into him and asked if she wanted to come out for drinks with the five of us the next day. Everything was going great until Tom joined us half an hour later. Tom didn't know anything about my plan, but it frustrated me that he took over the conversation and eventually left with the girl an hour later. I then sent Tom a private message telling him what I was trying to do, and he was very understanding. But the following weekend, he did it again. I tried talking to him about it, but he downplayed the situation.

Eventually, I decided not to invite Tom. I invited a coworker, and we went with just the four of us. They had a great time, and I made him get her Snapchat. We went out again the following weekend, and she told me they had been talking on Snapchat every day for a week and that she liked him. Eventually, with many hints from me and my boyfriend, he asked her out, and they are going on their second date this weekend.

So here is where I could be an asshole; Tom made a private CG with just me and my boyfriend and told us that he felt excluded the last couple of weeks. I told him i was sorry but he knew what we were trying to do but he was actively messing things up. He sent me a long text telling me it was not his fault she liked him and that he could not force her to like Marcus. How uncomfortable he was with my weird obsession with trying to get Marcus laid, even to the point of excluding him. I told him that it was not my problem, he couldn't keep his dick in check for one night, and that I could invite whoever I wanted and blocked him on everything.

My boyfriend agrees with me, but he thinks I'm being too harsh on Tom as he is just being Tom and has no bad intentions. Now I'm doubting myself if i made a mistake.

edit: I should have explained it better, but my friends did not know I was trying to set them up with Marcus. I just invited them to hang out with us and hoped they would start to get to know each other.

I brushed it off because we both have different tastes and, ultimately, I didn’t think my choice should impact her.

Later, Sarah told me she felt like I was flaunting my money in front of her, especially since I know she’s been struggling financially.

When it was time to pick my daughter up, Michelle texted me and said she had to go to work but Sarah had come home and is with the kids. I texted Sarah to let her know that I was on my way. Sarah replied and said to just knock then come inside, as she was still recovering from a recent surgery and might be slow. I didn't ask what kind of surgery, not my body, not my business. I have a very strict personal rule to never comment on another person's body unless it can be changed in 30 seconds or less (like food in teeth) or unless I am explicitly asked for input. I will compliment clothes or makeup or hair styles, but I stay away from commenting on someone's actual body.

When I arrived at Jane's house, I knocked and came inside, as instructed. Sarah came to greet me, and I immediately noticed it appeared that she had undergone top surgery. The way she was standing and leaning over made it seem like she was trying to show off her chest, but again, not my body, not my business. I had no confirmation that she had top surgery, I made the assumption based on the fact that I didn't see any bandages or wraps elsewhere on her body and the fact that her breasts seemed much fuller than the last time I saw her over the summer. It also felt really inappropriate to comment on a married woman's breasts, so I refrained from saying anything. (I am a cis woman.) We chatted for a bit as we always do when we pick up and drop off our daughter's at each other's houses, and then we were on our way. Sarah seemed disappointed as we said goodbye, her shoulders kind of fell and her tone of voice changed. I really got the feeling that she was excited to show off the results of her (assumed) gender-affirming surgery, which I understand. If I got new breasts I would also be excited to show them off! But again, she didn't explicitly tell me that she had top surgery, nor did she explicitly has for input on her body. If she had mentioned new breasts, of course I would have complimented and validated her.

So, AITA for not complimenting my friend because I wasn't sure? This happened a few days ago and I'm still ruminating. I feel bad, like my lack of compliment invalidated her. I feel like I ignored her. I'm really torn, I'm second guessing if I should've made an exception to my personal rule and just made a comment that she looked great or just straight up asked what kind of surgery she had when she mentioned it through text. I would especially love to hear from trans people on this subject.

  
Edit: Just adding a TLDR for anyone coming in later. The general consensus seems to be it wasn't asshole behavior to refrain from commenting on someone's breasts, but I should have been more proactive and kind and asked how she was recovering from surgery/offered to help. Which I completely agree with. I got the surgery text while I was driving to pick up my daughter, so I intended to ask once I got there so I wasn't texting and driving, but I completely forgot when faced with the inner conflict I was having. Even still, I am planning on sending a follow up text after work to ask her how she's feeling and offer to bring over dinner while she recovers.

36,1gh62a5,AITA for refusing to apologize to my neighbor after I ignored her while out for a walk?,"I (20 M) like to go on walks around my neighborhood almost every day. I like to put in earbuds and listen to music while walking too. I'm an introvert so I don't like stopping to talk to my neighbors if they're also out for a walk, I'll either wave or say a quick ""hello"" and continue on my walk. Now I have this neighbor, let's call her ""Rita"", up the street who is a bit of a problem. She's an older woman (possibly mid to late 70's) and she has a bit of main character syndrome. Rita is one of those old fashioned people that feels like their entitled to a full conversation with people while they're out walking, meaning a quick ""hello"" is unacceptable to her. 

I did not feel like stopping to talk to her, especially since I had other things to do after my walk and did not want to be out there longer than necessary. I just walked right by Rita's house with my earbuds in and pretended I didn't notice her sitting on her front porch. I got past her house and I heard the sound of someone yelling. I took one of my earbuds out while continuing to walk and I heard Rita yelling ""you hear me young man? I'm telling your mother about this!"" I thought she was just being dramatic and continued on my walk. 

When I got home, my mom was in the kitchen and stopped me. She told me that Rita called her and complained about me. She told me she isn't mad at me because she knows Rita is entitled and mean as well. However, she thought I should go over to Rita's house and apologize to her anyways because our neighborhood is pretty small and everybody knows everybody and she doesn't want Rita to badmouth us to anyone and make us look bad. I wasn't surprised because there's nothing my mother cares about more than her image. I told my mom I wasn't going to apologize because Rita needs to learn that she is not entitled to anyone's time.

37,1gh61z1,AITA for talking to my bio dad and not man who raised me?,"Long story short, my biological father wasn’t involved in much of my life growing up. Approximately two weeks a year in the summer. We had a lot of issues and I quit speaking to him around 10 or 11. 

My mother remarried when I was young and had my sibling. The guy she married is who I grew up calling dad. He was a good dad. Then he cheated on my mom and they divorced. I was mad, but we had a decent relationship until 6 ish years ago. 

Now, I am in my 30’s with kids of my own. My step-dad is so distant and has been since he was remarried. He never attempts to see my kids even though we live in the same small town. No calls, no texts. I invite him and his wife, along with my kids other grandparents, to every single thing my kids do. He hasn’t been to a single birthday of my kids in the last 7 years. He doesn’t come to recitals, games, school events. He DID surprise me by showing up to grandparents day one time. I text him pics of the kids, updates, etc and he doesn’t reply. But he is tech savvy so it’s not because he doesn’t know how. My youngest child didn’t even know who he was in photos, either. He also had been distant with my sibling as well. 

Cue my bio dad. In my early 30’s I gave him a chance to be a grandpa to my kids. He wasn’t a good dad to me, but I can tell he has changed and wanted them to have a chance to know him and his family. He has not disappointed one time. He lives across the country and has seen my kids more than the man that raised me. He calls to check on them, knows their hobbies, tells them funny stories over the phone, and even will FaceTime them to read them stories. I genuinely don’t hate talking to him. It’s been really nice. 

Here’s where I think I’m the asshole. I feel like I’m betraying my step-dad by allowing my bio dad to have an active role in mine and my kids lives. It seems very ass hole like to almost kick my SD to the curb. I also worry his parents are going to think less of me when they find out I’m talking to my BD again. It just seems like a slap in the face to the one that did the hard parts of parenting when he didn’t have to be. Am I the asshole? Should I cut ties with my bio dad? Any other suggestions? 

TLDR: am I the asshole for having a relationship with my bio dad when my step dad is the one who raised me?


ETA: My SD was my “dad” from age 4 or 5 on. Even when my mom and him divorced, he still called me his daughter. He’d come to my sport games, come over to my mom’s house, even with his previous girlfriends. Him and my mom still got a long very well and only stopped really speaking when he got his new girlfriend that is now his wife. I distinctly remember him crying on 911 because our school was on lockdown and he was so worried. He almost died a year ago, and when he came to, I was the first person he asked to see. I don’t think him divorcing my mom changed our relationship. They have been divorced since my younger sibling was a year old ish so that is another part. That makes me wonder if I am the asshole because he was that parent for me for so long, even when he had divorce, my mom and did not have to be anything for me.

I want to add, my step dad has taken on responsibility of being a grandfather to his wife’s ex boyfriends family members kid. What triggered my feelings today was seeing photos of him on many different days with someone he didn’t “raise” for 34 years and that persons child calling him grandpa. He has known the person 4 years, they live further away than us, but he makes that effort. I am happy that a child has people who love them, but I still feel hurt.

He also was very jealous when my biological father would comment on Facebook pictures of me or my partner before we had kids. My bio dad would do that, my stepdad would distance himself even further. At that point, we were still seeing each other regularly, but about a year after that is when he met his wife. maybe I am the asshole for ever even starting up that relationship again? I don’t think so, though after reading your guises comments.

The only other thing I can think of is that his wife doesn’t like me. She has mentioned I’m so much like my mother a few times before. And maybe we are too “poor” for them? They never have nice things to say about gifts we give them and make a big deal if they don’t get a gift on a specific holiday (like if it’s a couple days after). So maybe my family just doesn’t fit with his anymore.

My kids do see him on some holidays. We go for Grandparents uncles, etc.  However, he hardly speaks to us, and then will be upset when the children do not want to go to him. We live less than 2 miles apart in the exact same town. It is very hard to grasp that someone could be in my life for so long and then kick me out of it so quickly.

But first, let me give you some context: I have a small group of friends, 2 girls and 3 guys including me. About 2 years ago, we had a huge argument, mostly me against them. I messed up at the time (I wasn’t honest about what I was doing instead of hanging out with them). I went through a really dark period, and they pushed me away from the group. It was terrible, but we managed to reconcile. I began and continue a therapeutic journey with a psychologist who probably saved my life, as I was likely in deep depression (due to other events coloring that period).

Despite everything, with one of these friends, Paul (22M), there’s always been something lingering. He was the one who most strongly opposed the reconciliation, even behaving rudely. Once things were resolved, I apologized for my part, but he never did for his behavior. I forgave him and don’t treat him differently, but every time I’m around him, I feel something unpleasant deep down, which has kept me from getting as close as before. I’m certain it’s mutual because, apart from joking, we never discuss anything deep, which he probably does with the rest of the group.

A few days ago, Paul, our friend Kate, and I went out in the evening. The night went well, with the usual jokes, a walk, and as it got late, we headed home. By chance, a conversation about Paul’s health came up, which I won’t share for privacy. Despite continuous tests, he didn’t know what was wrong. While I walked slightly ahead, Kate said something in a low voice, like, “Maybe it’s this.” Realizing it was private, I quickened my pace to avoid overhearing but caught bits of it. The two then fell silent for the rest of the walk back to the car. We drove home exchanging only a few words.

I’m not deaf or stupid. I know my friend is dealing with either depression or an eating disorder—or both. I’ve been there.

39,1gh56jv,AITA If I Kick My Roommate Out? ,"Hi everyone, little bit of context I am 24(F) and my roomate is 24(M), who was my co worker beforehand. About 5 years ago right out of high school I purchased my first home and decided to help with bills I would rent out my extra rooms, because I did plan on going to university in another city. Fast forward 2 years my first lease with basement tenants was ending and I personally didn’t want resign with them so they left, and I started searching for 2 new roomates. At the time I was on the waitlist for university because the program I wanted to take is only offered by one university where I live and the waitlist was huge, so I was still home working. A co worker was going through a rough time so I offered for them to move into a room for a set rate plus additional $60 for internet split between us both. About 2 months into them living here, I had to move to another city for university and they were left at the house for 6 months while I was there. I checked the house frequently and on one of my visits I ended up having to clean the whole house, I took out 4 bags of garbage and 2 bags of cans. It never got to that level of uncleanliness, so I chalked it up to just being a rough time still. Slowly turned into being late every month on rent but I let that slide because they were always between jobs. Fast forward again to the end of this summer. I have constantly cleaning up after them still, late rent, etc. I have had conversations with them over and over again. So I thought bringing in another roomate downstairs would help with keeping it tidy. But now the original roommate has gotten into a new relationship. Which is totally fine good for them, but they have given the key to my house to her and she has let herself in (she’s only been over to the house once before for roommates birthday before this). Which I wasn’t impressed with nor was the other basement tenant. So we asked him not to do that again and they agreed. Then while the rest of us were away the security camera shows him and her brining in 3 garbage bags and laundry basket of her clothes, 6 loads of laundry total to do with my machines. Without asking. Whatever all our rent doesn’t cover for utilities I have to pay out of my own pocket. Needless to say neither me or my new tenant can do this anymore, and would like to have him go. But some of my friends said it’s an asshole move right now with Christmas approaching. So would I be the asshole if I kicked them out now? 


EDIT: I have also had a conversation with the tenant as well, telling them they either have to start cleaning up or I will raise rent to get a cleaner to clean the house since I’m away for work a good portion of the month, they declined to bring in a cleaner so I told them if they don’t keep up they would be looking at eviction this is was roughly a year to 6 months ago.

Then while the rest of us were away the security camera shows him and her brining in 3 garbage bags and laundry basket of her clothes, 6 loads of laundry total to do with my machines. Without asking. Whatever all our rent doesn’t cover for utilities I have to pay out of my own pocket. Needless to say neither me or my new tenant can do this anymore, and would like to have him go. But some of my friends said it’s an asshole move right now with Christmas approaching. So would I be the asshole if I kicked them out now? 


EDIT: I have also had a conversation with the tenant as well, telling them they either have to start cleaning up or I will raise rent to get a cleaner to clean the house since I’m away for work a good portion of the month, they declined to bring in a cleaner so I told them if they don’t keep up they would be looking at eviction this is was roughly a year to 6 months ago.

One of my ex's children was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer. Their household has seen a lot of changes and my son has struggled with those changes. I pick up the difference where I can. So my son still goes to his activities (paid for by me), I put extra in his lunch account at school so he can always get a school lunch (his preference over a packed lunch from home) and I went a little bigger for Christmas, which I always start buying early.

My son always knew I saved for his future. He mentioned it to his mom after his mom said they were pulling all finances on their end, including anything put aside for the futures of him and his half siblings. This brought my ex to me and she asked how much I saved which I refused to tell her. She asked me for access to the account and I said no. She suggested I should give it to her so it can go toward funding all the help they need to cover the cost of a sick child and I refused. My ex tried to get our son involved and my son told me he didn't want to keep giving stuff up and he didn't want him to take his money. I promised my son it wouldn't happen.

My ex ended up sending me a breakdown of what they want the money for. I did look over it but only after I told her I would not take our sons money and give it to her for her other child. I told her I had a duty to my son and not her other children. Ex started calling me names so I ended the call. She then sent me a text asking me how I could say no to helping a child who's sick. I told her that their sick child was not my responsibility and my responsibility is to ensure our son has a good life, the child I made with her, not the children she made with her husband.

41,1gh3syk,WIBTA if I spend Christmas Eve alone?,"**WIBTA if I spend Christmas Eve alone?**

Hi everyone,

I’m (22f) dealing with holiday family drama after my parents split earlier this year. They had a 20-year relationship that felt loveless, and my sister (25f) and I always wondered why my dad stayed. So, we weren’t surprised when they finally split.

Over the past two years, my mom has been in and out of clinics due to severe depression. She eventually realized she didn’t want to keep my dad unhappy by staying together, so she ended things and moved out. She also met a new girlfriend at the clinic, and they live together now. My dad didn’t take the breakup well—he quickly turned to dating apps and had a rough period. I tried to support him, listening and spending time with him to help him feel less alone. Now that he has a new girlfriend, we’re not as close as we were.

This brings us to Christmas, which is very important in our family. I hoped we could all celebrate together—both parents, their new partners, my sister, and grandparents. But my dad refuses to spend the holiday with my mom and suggested that my sister and I split our time between them. I don’t want to choose, especially since my mom lost most of her family in the split, while my dad lives close to our grandparents.

My sister is okay with his plan, but I feel it’s unfair since we’d likely spend the main part of Christmas (dinner) with our dad, just because he’s closer and it’s the house we grew up in.

So, I’m considering two options: either I spend Christmas alone and visit them afterward, or we have Christmas at my sister’s place and let our parents decide if they want to join. My sister feels this approach would unfairly put her in a position of choosing between me and them.

42,1gh3gqb,AITA for not wanting my parents to make changes to my childhood room for my sister's baby.,"I (27 women) leave abroad for almost 4 years now. My parents still live in my childhood home, where I grew up from the age of 8. In the past four years, I have only been able to go back home twice, and each time, my room had been changed.

It started with small things, like all of my products from the communal bathroom being moved into boxes back in my room. When I arrived the first time, my room was a mess and not organized like I had left it before moving out. My mom had stored her belongings in my room as if it were an attic. She took my desk chair and nightstand for her room, along with some of my storage boxes to use for herself, and so on.

I clearly told my parents from the beginning that I didn't want them to change anything in my room, because I needed it to stay as it was. Today, my mother called me on video, and while showing me my bunny (they are taking care of him, which I'm very grateful for, and I feel guilty for not being able to bring him with me where I live), I noticed they had moved his cage and thrown away my bean bag.

I asked why they did that, and my mom told me they were setting up a baby bed for my sister’s baby, who is due in a month. I became angry and raised my voice, saying I was annoyed that they keep throwing away my belongings or changing things around in my room. I didn’t say I was against the baby using my room, but I just felt they could have either not moved things or at least asked me first.

My mom told me they threw away the bean bag because it was dirty and couldn't be cleaned, and she didn’t want the baby sleeping in the same room with a dirty bean bag. I understand that the baby’s health is important, but I also told her that I didn’t understand why the baby would need to sleep in my room (she has enough space in her room) when my bunny will probably make noise and wake up the baby.

I tried to express myself to make my mother understand that my room is very important to me. They know that I don't like change in any situation. I'm living in a country where I’m not sure I’ll be able to settle permanently. I will probably have to move somewhere else eventually, and I won’t be able to take all my belongings with me because it would be too expensive. That’s why I haven’t really decorated or bought furniture for my current place.

My childhood room is my safe place—a place where I know I can go back anytime if something goes wrong, where I feel grounded. After crying and hanging up the phone, I thought about it. I know it's only a bean bag, but today it’s that, and tomorrow, what else will it be? Will they move my bunny out so the baby can sleep better? It may sound selfish, but I feel like the baby will now have everything, and I’ll have nothing that feels like mine anymore.

My Life as always be complicated and definitly not easy since early ages cause of an addict father but I managed to always keep it rather on a positive side. Life is not a fairy tale but i keep on going.
When i had my first baby, my man got a new position in his job (always been supportive for him) and we moved in another city for his job. Long story short ive made the move to open my own beauty salon in the same year cause i thought its time for me to settle and work for myself to plan my future.
(you can figure that my family dont run on a gold mine i will inherit some day)

It is not an easy job, i work my ass dealing with employees, making payments, getting creative finding clients… but it keeps me happy to do it.
 (covid period was freaking hard on the money but i did it with taking 20 000$, money on my part of the house). Still my clients and employees were there so i am proud to managed trough it.

Here i am, still convinced my life could be Better financialy cause i want to cover my old days cause my job is not giving the liberty of putting a lot on the side for now and the only way i see is to invest in the building i am operating. I have managed to ask the owner, negociated a good price (35000$ under evaluation) and went to different bank but my company cant buy it alone for now cause i am still paying for 2 machines (3 years remaining).

So i asked my man if is interested to make this with me. We have a good house and we still owe a bit on it but now its worth way more than we’ve paid.

The salon would pay everything after the buying cost and we will be 50/50 on the building. I think its a good opportunity cause we are under evaluation and its a good building.
But i am really thight with the machines for 3 years max (maybe less cause its a new services and income should increase) so if i make less i will covert it since its me that have take that risk.

So he ask to see my numbers (never was interested in my business) and he got super defensive mode on he is not willing to lose the house on this. He is not seeing that its an investment numbers will be good after this (i have made the same money it cost me in payment so break even for 2 new services)
I am sad to see him so defensive and not at all supportive. I guess entrepreneur and employee dont see number the same way.

My man has a retirement plan with his job and all about security and we never really talked about mine . it was an « to each their own » i guess kinda thing. He also never wanted to marry me cause its too dangerous for him to lose is retirement plan if I leave cause he tell me that he would never (that one is hard to swallow still)

Edit: my partner hadn’t seen her since he was 11, she took off with his 2 younger siblings and didn’t talk to him until he was 18. moved in with her when he was almost 20 because she lived closer to me, we’ve been together for 3 years and he only lived with her for a month or 2 before moving in with me. This is the first time he hasn’t agreed with me, shes also an alcoholic who thinks mental health is fake and refuses help",0.0,-0.00781934056431055,0,1
46,1gh1ss5,"AITAH girlfriend feels entitled to part of my ""payraise""","I'm having a fight with my girlfriend about my current situation and I need some outsider information.

I rent a place from my employer and my girlfriend lives with me. We agreed to split the costs 50/50 since we both work full time and I got a sweet deal on the house. We pay far below market value already.

Recently I have negotiated a raise and have come to an agreement that my employer is going to lower the rent because it's beneficial for us both in regards to taxes.

Now on to the issue. I think my girlfriend should continue to pay half of what we originally agreed upon but she thinks she only need to pay half of what I pay now since that is what we agreed upon. I don't think this is fair since this means I am effectively giving away 50% of my raise.

AITAH for this or am I justified in my thinking?

She tells us she's getting popcorn right there and we watch her leave in the direction but we continue to eat and order food. 
We all watch the area for her to comeback. 5 mins turns to 10, then to 15. We call her cellphone it's going straight to voicemail. Know we are worried.

I live abroad and when I'm back home  and meet some family & friends, I am fried by quite few people as to when I (we) will be having children.

I usually just politely smile, laugh it off and show a picture of my beautiful cat and say: ""what for? I already have a cat"". 

Recently, when I visited (due to my grandad's death, who practically raised me), after a total of 12 people asking me (some even during the funeral festivities) I snapped.

Her question was not even the typical ""so, when are the babies coming"" but: _So, I see no children yet, will you just settle as an auntie?_

It was a family friend, who I actually like. She is young (45) and has two children.

Instead of smiling and doing yet again my cat comment, I snapped:
 
_Please, do not ask me or anyone this question_
_What if I just had an spontaneous abortion 3 weeks ago?_
_What if we've been trying for the past 8 years with no success?_
_What if my husband had cancer twice as a child and was left sterile?_
_What if we haves pent all of our savings in treatments and no longer are able to pay for them + no longer will be accepted in adoption lists because we spent all of our money?_
_What if we just don't want to?_
_What if we just gave up after 4 non viable fetuses and a devastating depression?_ 
_I know you do not mean ill, but PLEASE, stop asking this question._

She was left speechless. I did not yell at her nor raise my voice, but we were in public. My grandma, uncle, husband, her husband, 3 other friends and 1 her children were present. This was after the funeral. 

From the examples above, one applies to me, all of the rest are real situations some of my personal friends, work colleagues and other women and couples I know have gone through.

For a moment, I felt free. I felt that I had to say it, and I think I did express well a wide range of realistic situations we could be in, because all of them are real.
But now the realization of all is settling in and I have a weird feeling about it. I feel unease.
I think that she is just uneducated or oblivious, maybe just ignorant.
I am afraid this has scarred our relationship and any future meetings will be uncomfortable. 
I might have dumped all my rage on her and that she did not really deserve it.

I had a few comments following this.
My grandma just feels sad for both, she says that I should have just let it slide, but she does know what our situation is and somehow understands where I came from.
My uncle is quite mad and says I should not have spoken to a friend this way.
My husband supports me.
The other people did not dare saying anything (yet). 


50% of me feels freed. Relieved somehow thinking I might have educated her and the rest of people present, and therefore other people in my situation will be spared the question.

51,1gh0k9x,WIBTA for arguing with my brother about my daughter’s birthday?,"ETA: thank you so so much for quick responses and the perspective I needed! Important context I should have added is that I do know they are child free by choice currently, and there wasn’t a specific celebration to invite them to, I was just surprised not to hear from them. However I totally hear what you’re all saying - I was letting my emotions about my child override seeing other peoples’ perspectives and I’ll leave it and quietly get over being pissed off.

WIBTA for arguing with my brother about my daughter’s birthday?

For context: me and my husband, my parents and my brother and his wife all live in the same small town. My husband and I have two children, brother and his wife don’t have children and are slightly younger than us (we’re all in our 30s). My husband and I see a lot of my parents as they are amazingly helpful with childcare and we try to treat them and spend time with them as much as possible to show our appreciation. None of us see much of my brother and his wife, this often annoys me as I feel my brother isn’t supporting our parents enough and I know it makes them sad. However, my parents don’t like conflict and would like everyone to get along, so I’ve never spoken to my brother about how I’m feeling.

Earlier this month was one of my children’s birthdays. Obviously a very exciting day for a little one, and for us grown ups too as she is the first grandchild for my parents so every birthday is very celebrated! Lots of family WhatsApp groups were popping off with birthday messages, so
I know that my brother and his wife knew on the day that it was my daughter’s birthday, even if they had forgotten it was coming up. 

The reason for my upset is that I didn’t hear from them at all. No card, no present, not even a phone call or a text. They’ve always done Christmas and birthday presents before so it’s unusual, and we’ve not heard from them since. There hasn’t been a falling out between us in the run up to this event, we don’t usually argue.

So here’s my issue: a few weeks on I’m still very upset about it and want to send my brother a message along the lines of “hey, it upset me that we didn’t hear from you on daughter’s birthday, she would have loved to hear from her auntie and uncle. Have we done something to upset you that we’re not aware of?”

However, my brother and his wife are both quite fiery people and I’m half convinced that a message like this would start an argument, which wouldn’t bother me if I was only thinking about my feelings, but I am worried about upsetting my parents. My husband is on the fence about the whole thing and thinks it’s pointless addressing it because they won’t change.

52,1gh0gp6,AITA for 'Over decorating' for Halloween ,"I (22m) LOVE halloween. It's my absolute favourite holiday. When I was younger my parents did halloween big with  loads of decorations, parties, planned events and we always went guising.

Last year we moved into a new village and I had a great halloween, I took my brothers kids out guising and handed out sweets to the kids at the door. I decorated big and had no problems. 

This year a new neighbour moved in next door and have a son who is lovely (I guess about 7 or 8 years old).

 I decorated big again and when my neighbour came to the door we started chatting, the wife commented on my display in the front garden.  complete with teddy's shoved in a black bag and a shovel with fake gravestones and bones. (Everyone else loved it )

I apologised if it was a bit much for the kids but she said that wasn't her issue, she said ""your making the rest of the village look like we don't care, some of us work and have kids to look after so we don't have time"".


I kind of ignored her, gave her kid some sweets and bid them a happy halloween.  This morning I saw a post on the community Facebook page of her going on a rant about rude young people and the same statements she gave me last night.  No one really commented on it besides her husband. 

I showed my mum and she agreed that it was a bit crazy that she posted that but that I do tend to go over board and I joked about how that's how she raised me and we laughed.  She said next year maybe tone it down though.

53,1gh0g4x,AITA For selling my appartment to someone my neighbour didn’t approve?,"I moved into an apartment building over four years ago. My partner (32M) and I (29F) met and moved in together in the second year, and since then, we became close friends with our neighbors Scott (40) and Christy (43). We’d hang out, go out for dinners, have drinks, take our dogs out for playdates, and had a great circle of friends that included two other women from the building. Scott and Christy lived across the hall and had an open-door policy, so we’d always pop in for a chat. This friendship lasted a few years without issues… until my partner and I sold our apartment.

There was an “odd” couple at the end of our hall—mostly harmless, but they’d have loud arguments and were generally awkward to be around. The guy worked at a local bar we frequented, so we’d run into them now and then.

My partner and I had been house-hunting for months with no luck. Our apartment had to be sold for family reasons, so we were stressed and eager to find a place. Finally, we found a house that was perfect for us and our dogs, within budget. We put down a deposit and started the process of selling our apartment. After several low offers, we got one above our expected price while on holiday and had to accept immediately, as we were close to the cooling-off period for our new house. The buyer was described as a “first-time investor,” and it seemed like our best option.

Just before we finished cooling off, we found out the buyer was actually the mother of the odd couple at the end of the hall. We were uneasy since we knew they weren’t well-liked in the building, but we’d already committed to the sale. Friends had even joked, “hope you don’t sell to them,” but we felt we had no choice.

We celebrated the sale with the two other girls in our group, and one of them, who lived in the complex, was a bit annoyed but completely understood our situation and was happy for us. Later, Scott and Christy joined us, and when we told them, they lost it. They called us “dogs,” said they were “done with us,” and insisted we’d made the worst mistake of lives. We tried to explain our situation—that we would’ve lost the house if we didn’t take the offer—but they didn’t listen and just kept yelling.

After a week of no contact, Scott and Christy left a gift bag at our door. Inside were dog-themed kitchen sponges that read “dirty dog” on the packaging, a bottle of wine (they knew we didn’t drink wine), and a lollipop (which my partner loves). The card inside said something like “Thanks for being great neighbors and good luck.” We couldn’t tell if this was a peace offering or another dig.

I’m now writing this from our new house, where we’ve been for over a month. We never heard another word from Scott and Christy, apart from a few awkward smiles in the hallway. Thankfully, the other two women have stayed in touch and remain wonderful friends.

As much as I’m sad and hurt by everything that happened, I still feel weirdly guilty about giving them a “bad” neighbor. So, am I the asshole?


Edit: the odd couple moved out about 6 months before we did. And it was assumed the mother was buying it for them to move into.

We celebrated the sale with the two other girls in our group, and one of them, who lived in the complex, was a bit annoyed but completely understood our situation and was happy for us. Later, Scott and Christy joined us, and when we told them, they lost it. They called us “dogs,” said they were “done with us,” and insisted we’d made the worst mistake of lives. We tried to explain our situation—that we would’ve lost the house if we didn’t take the offer—but they didn’t listen and just kept yelling.

After a week of no contact, Scott and Christy left a gift bag at our door. Inside were dog-themed kitchen sponges that read “dirty dog” on the packaging, a bottle of wine (they knew we didn’t drink wine), and a lollipop (which my partner loves). The card inside said something like “Thanks for being great neighbors and good luck.” We couldn’t tell if this was a peace offering or another dig.

I’m now writing this from our new house, where we’ve been for over a month. We never heard another word from Scott and Christy, apart from a few awkward smiles in the hallway. Thankfully, the other two women have stayed in touch and remain wonderful friends.

As much as I’m sad and hurt by everything that happened, I still feel weirdly guilty about giving them a “bad” neighbor. So, am I the asshole?


Edit: the odd couple moved out about 6 months before we did. And it was assumed the mother was buying it for them to move into. ",0.0,0.032577481120824814,0,1
54,1gh0aq8,AITA for helping my mom go against my brother's wishes?,"OK, so this isn't a long post as I'm bad at explaining situations. But anyways I'll give some context. I(M 20) live with my parents(focusing on my mother, so F 56) , as does my brother(M 23). Within this living arrangement none of us pay rent and are free to use the laundry machines, the bathrooms, the kitchen, kitchen and bathroom storage, and are free to do whatever we wish to our rooms. As I said, we don't pay rent, so it's a pretty nice setup. A couple of months ago, our washing machine broke, and we needed to have a guy come by and fix it up. So we needed to clean up the area around the washing machine. The laundry room had a problem of being a trash and box holding room that we didn't know what to do with. This needed to be cleared out so the repairman could do his job.

I'm a full-time college student and part-time server, so I don't have much time to do things here at home, but I do what I can when I can. My brother only has a job and has a lot more free time in the day than I do. So he ended up cleaning the laundry room and all the trash bags, which we use these heavy duty fabric contractor bags so animals cannot tear into them easily, end up on the porch with the expectation that within a week he'd run them to the dump(making dump runs is the only chore expected of him and he doesn't do it nearly consistently enough). However, that week never came. Instead, the bags sat on the porch for 3 months. This whole time my mother was getting anxious as she could not find a specific cloak she was looking for and was certain my brother threw it into the bags that are on the porch and she wanted to take a look to see if it was there. He VEHEMENTLY denied this with the claim ""You should trust me when I do something"" and ""I'll never do anything for you again if you keep wanting to look through them"" which, I'll admit, I agreed with him on. I have a record of believing my mother to be a hoarder and figured that if she looked through the bags, she'd keep a bunch of trash with the words of ""it's still usable"" or ""I have a use for this"". But finally, after 3 months of hearing this, I decided to help her. So I go out with my mother and help her out. Opening the bags, looking through them, not making a mess, closing them back up, and even rebagging one bag that had been ripped into by animals.

And in the end, we actually found what she had been looking for. It was in one of the bags, just as she thought.

We kept working, and before we finished, he came outside. He was mad because ""yall didn't trust me"" and ""Yall never trust me"" and he did NOT care that we found what she was looking for and that, because I helped her out, she wouldn't ever bring it up again since she doesn't have to.

He would get so angry at her for ever asking about it and then I, in a moment of tired uncaring, helped her for 30 minutes and now she's happy cause she can clean the cloak and have it again, I'm happy cause she won't need to ask about it again, and yet he's not.

56,1ggzsh4,AITA for not being a friend who put equal efforts? ,"
My childhood friendship ended because the efforts I put was not enough. 

There's this (ex)friend who was one of the closest people to me. Told her about literally everything under the sun, and she too felt the same. 
Now the thing with me is I'm never really good at maintaining friendships because I've never put the kind of effort in messaging or calling, but I'll always be there regardless. Like no message for 2 years, but then if you randomly message me saying you need someone I'll be there. Low maintenance is the word, I guess.

But with this friend it was not like that, I messaged her more than anyone possibly cus it was a habit to talk about things to her. 

I think she romanticised our relation to a point that all plans she made sounded like dates. Which was also cool, but she started becoming bitter when I didn’t make similar plans with her. I never actively make plans with anyone (other than my boyfriend), but always show up and am glad when she tells me she wants to meet. 

It was understandable that she wanted me to make plans as well, and I told her I'll try. I also told her ""I'm not going to promise you that I'll make plans every week cus I'm scared I'll run to meet you just to keep a promise. I dont want it to be that way. Instead I'll try better"". She didnt like the response at all.

One time she made a plan without even asking me (at 10 in the night) and I was dead tired just coming back from work, so I couldn’t handle a meetup at that point. So I call her up, and I was very annoyed, so I half-screamt at her saying ""bro please dont come today, I really cant. I'm fucking tired""

Now she got really hurt about that cus I've never got angry at her. So this is what she does afterwards,
- cried, sent me a message saying I hurt her terribly.
- I apologised saying I was really really tired, and I shouldn't have screamt at her.
- doesnt talk to me even after I called multiple times to apologise again. 
- goes on to insta to post some diss on me. There's one story in which she called me worthless. And then few more stories on a similar line.

So at this point I lose it, because no matter how horrible the fight went, if you think that all those years of friendship was worthless and that “I put the worth on you” kinda shit, I’m out. 

That friendship never went back to normal, cus well I didn’t want that anymore. I have very very few friends who understand that I might not be the most social or effort-ful friend, and I’m thankful they’ve stayed with me. I felt bad when I lost this friendship, cus I really treasured it. But that all changed when she spewed such shit over a fight.

Anyway i was in good terms with all as thats my personality I dont pick out flaws in people and if they are good to me i am good in return. Anyway so this one girl lets call her carol, so carol was disliked by rest of the group but i wasnt sure how deep the dislike ran so when she met my husbands cousin brother n they hit it off i was very supportive and happy. We would talk about our future as sisters in law and have a great time (atleast according to me). Fast forward to few months before her wedding with the said cousin of my husband the rest of the girls in group started to have much more problem with her and they started to ignore her and eventually totally cut her out. It was a very mean behaviour according to me n when i mentioned it to the rest of the group they dismissed it by saying that i wasnt there to wistness all the tantrums n drama carol brought into their lives so i backed off thinking it isnt my place to tell them whats right or not. This year carol got married to my husbands cousin and when we meet for family het togethers she doesnt talk to me at all. I confronted her n she said she doesnt like me because she thinks i took her place in the group. In her words ‘you came into the group and i got kicked out.’ I explained to her that i had nothing to do with it infact i tried to explain carols side to other girls but it wasnt in my hand as everything that went down between them had been festering for years but she downright said she can forget about them as she doesnt meet them now but as she has to meet me often and all the anger in her head gets directed towards me n she cant fake being nice to me.

58,1ggzfve,AITA for locking my door to keep my stepbrother out?,"I know what this sounds like but there’s no better way to put it.

I (19F) have known my stepbrother (27M) for about 15 years, but I’ve never liked him. Honestly, he’s never given me a reason to. We both live at home—I’m finishing college (I live in the UK, so this is before university), and he’s in school. For more context, he’s not working, and as far as I know, he’s never had a job. My parents fully support him.

He makes me uncomfortable. I’ve tried to have a sibling-like relationship with him and be polite, but he doesn’t give me much reason to. For example, he was the first person to make me feel insecure about myself. As I got older, he started making comments about my body, like “It’s because your boobs are big,” “You’re P-shaped,” or “Your ass is shaping up.” I don’t care if he thinks it’s a compliment or just a joke—I don’t like it when people comment on my body. It makes me feel icky, like people are paying more attention to me than I’d like. Maybe he thinks it’s okay because we’re “siblings,” but to me, it’s just not normal.

It’s weird because my best friend, who’s known him for a long time, doesn’t seem to mind similar comments from him, so maybe he thinks we’re the same. But what really makes me uncomfortable is that he often comes into my room unannounced, sometimes just standing by the door and staring as a “joke,” which creeps me out. When I get noticeably upset, he’ll say something like, “Jeez,” as if I should just go along with it. If I ask him to knock or say I want privacy, he questions me and makes insinuations like, “Why? Are you watching porn or something?” Even if I were, why would it matter? I’m 19.

Recently, I installed a lock on my door. I’d lost my old key, so I’ve been without a lock for a while, but his behavior finally pushed me to get one. Now, he has to knock before coming in. He keeps saying it’s “weird” that I’d lock myself in my room during the day, but I only use it when I want privacy, mostly on weekends. Personally, I think it’s a lot weirder that a man 10 years older than me has a problem with me wanting alone time. Most of the time, I’m literally just sitting in my room reading.

I don’t know if I’m overreacting. I don’t think I am but no one else seems to think this is weird. I don’t want to insinuate that he’s a pervert or whatever but if the shoe fits…

1. My parents aren’t his biggest fans to put it lightly and I was scared to bring it up with them because I didn’t want to be the reason they cut him off completely and give him reason to resent me. 

2. We didn’t really grow up together seeing as he’s been in boarding school since I’ve known him and went to uni abroad after. He’s always had this weird attitude but i think it was definitely amplified by the fact.

3. Maybe I’m naive but I don’t think he has the guts to take it any further than he has. He knows that it would be the end of him, so safety is not my biggest concern. It’s more my right to privacy and the ethics of such creepy behavior. 

4. I have expressed my discomfort to him many many times. It seems he’s getting better but the fact that it was a conversation I even had to have with him makes me feel really shitty.

59,1ggzck6,AITA for being an overachiever in my pregnancy?,"I'm 26 and I have a friend who is 26 as well. We met as part of a larger friend group and have gotten closer since we're both pregnant at the same time I'm 28 weeks and she's 23 weeks. We're still friends with the other girls and see them regularly but we see each other weekly, go shopping, go out to eat etc.

The last month or so, she's been canceling plans a lot because she's not feeling well which is understandable. Her husband is deployed and she just has her sister near her but her sister has a family. I told her each time to text me if she needs anything that I'm only a call away. I also made her a Lasagna which she's been craving a lot and had my husband drop it off.

She came over yesterday when I was making cookies and cupcakes for my nephews. We were hanging out when she asked me what I did in the times our plans were canceled so I started telling her that I caught up with an old friend who was in town, visited family, signed up for prenatal yoga and I finished the last of our nursery shopping and started putting it together with my husband. 

She seemed to slump so I asked her what was wrong and she said that she wishes she could put her nursery with her husband. I gave her a side hug and told her I'm sorry that he's not here, then to cheer her up I asked her if she wanted our friends and I to come over and help her? It wouldn't be the same but at least that way she'll have her girls with her. She stiffened and I let her go to give her space and started icing the cookies and cupcakes. I asked her if she wanted some but she shook her head and just kept staring at me before she asked quietly why did I have to be this way? I asked her what she meant and she just gestured in my direction and said ""like this, why do you always have to make me feel shitty about myself?"" I was shocked and asked her what I did and she said that I was always an overachiever but that she didn't think I'd try so hard in my pregnancy too. She started listing what I've been doing which is baking/cooking food all the time, staying fit and going for walks and stuff, keeping my house spotless, still having an active sex life and a social life. I asked her if she wanted me to be miserable instead? And reminded her that I did those stuff even before getting pregnant, It's not like I was or am doing anything extraordinary, just regular life stuff. She shook her head and said that I just had to make her look like a lazy cow in comparison. I was gaping by this point and what could I say? She was accusing me of something I apparently did by being myself so I just asked her to please leave and she did.

I thought about sending her a text to make sure she's okay but what would I even say? I asked advice from another third party friend who doesn't know her and she said that I should distance myself because she doesn't sound like a friend.

She came over yesterday when I was making cookies and cupcakes for my nephews. We were hanging out when she asked me what I did in the times our plans were canceled so I started telling her that I caught up with an old friend who was in town, visited family, signed up for prenatal yoga and I finished the last of our nursery shopping and started putting it together with my husband. 

She seemed to slump so I asked her what was wrong and she said that she wishes she could put her nursery with her husband. I gave her a side hug and told her I'm sorry that he's not here, then to cheer her up I asked her if she wanted our friends and I to come over and help her? It wouldn't be the same but at least that way she'll have her girls with her. She stiffened and I let her go to give her space and started icing the cookies and cupcakes. I asked her if she wanted some but she shook her head and just kept staring at me before she asked quietly why did I have to be this way? I asked her what she meant and she just gestured in my direction and said ""like this, why do you always have to make me feel shitty about myself?"" I was shocked and asked her what I did and she said that I was always an overachiever but that she didn't think I'd try so hard in my pregnancy too. She started listing what I've been doing which is baking/cooking food all the time, staying fit and going for walks and stuff, keeping my house spotless, still having an active sex life and a social life. I asked her if she wanted me to be miserable instead? And reminded her that I did those stuff even before getting pregnant, It's not like I was or am doing anything extraordinary, just regular life stuff. She shook her head and said that I just had to make her look like a lazy cow in comparison. I was gaping by this point and what could I say? She was accusing me of something I apparently did by being myself so I just asked her to please leave and she did.

I thought about sending her a text to make sure she's okay but what would I even say? I asked advice from another third party friend who doesn't know her and she said that I should distance myself because she doesn't sound like a friend. I'm stuck in the middle because maybe my actions did make her feel bad? but on the other hand why would they make her feel bad?",4.0,1.0296672582626343,1,0

65,1ggxtrf,AITA for telling my friend I don’t like her bf ,"Hi,

So, to start this off—Happy Halloween! Feels fitting that tonight of all nights, I’m making a post about a scary experience with a straight man.

Anyway, tonight my friend (25, f) and I (24, f) decided to go out to our local gay bar. We got matching outfits and makeup and hung out for a few hours. After a while, she said she wanted to leave, which was fine. The only issue I had is that at this club, there’s a rule to stay out of the middle of the floor when there are performers, so I asked her beforehand if she wanted to leave to tell me before the show started. She waited until it had just started to say she wanted to leave, and that bothered me. I started to panic, and she said, “You can just stay here if you want.” Mind you, she and her other friend were both going to be leaving. I was tipsy and didn’t want to be alone, so I said no, let’s not get in the middle of the aisle. For context, this club is VERY small and tightly packed, so it’s hard to move when they ask you not to be in the middle.

So, we go to leave, and we had a deal: I would buy drinks, and she would get the Uber. Her boyfriend (30, m) is an Uber driver, and since he was in the area, I guess she just called him instead. I was fine with this until the last minute when she made a joke that he was on his phone and driving. Then she asked me to “rate” the Uber, and I said that I thought it was a “3/10” because he was on his phone. He then proceeded to pull over on the side of the road and said, “Okay, bye.” She laughed and also said, “Damn, okay, bye.” So I got out because what else was I supposed to do, and I walked home.

My issue is, I’m a girl alone at night, in the dark, and I’m tipsy walking home. Luckily it wasn’t too far, but something could’ve happened. It makes me really uncomfortable that, one, she would’ve left me at the club alone, and two, that she was okay with leaving me like that. So it old her that I think it’s strange that she was okay with her bf doing that and it made me really uncomfortable and I think her bf is immature.

66,1ggxnnx,AITA for calling out a Tesla driver?,"I was on my way to the supermarket after work, and there was a driver who did not signal while changing lanes and turning, all the way from the highway to the supermarket parking lot. I’ve seen my fair share of drivers in NJ acting like public roads are their driveways, so I’m unsure why I decided to speak up this time. 

Anyways, I spotted the middle-age guy soon after entering the food court and asked if he drives the gray Tesla to confirm. I also recognized him because he was still sitting in his car by the time I parked. I then politely mention (nobody within earshot) that I noticed he didn't signal at all or that maybe his blinkers were busted, trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. I clarify that he wasn't driving recklessly or anything but that it would be super helpful to others on the road if he simply used blinkers. I say something to the effect of setting an example for new or young drivers on the road. He quickly claims that he did use them, of course, and I assert that it's fine, but I would appreciate it if someone had a chance like this to let me know. He goes back to his phone, and I walk away to order my bubble tea. 

About a minute later, he approaches me and raises his voice enough to attract the attention of a few people ordering from the next shop, who distance themselves. He accuses me of being offensive and repeats lines like “You don't know me” and “Who are YOU?”, implying that only people who know him can say something, I suppose. I calmly replied that I'm just a fellow driver in a public space and inquired whether he expects to only share the road with people he knows. I consider saying, “I’m glad I don’t know you”, but don’t want to cause a scene. I asked why he felt I was being rude, but I don’t think he ever answered. Things didn't really escalate from there, and to be honest, I don’t really recall how that second interaction ended, except that we continued waiting for our food several feet from each other.

At some point, I’ve gotten my tea and am still waiting on my dry pot. On my way out from picking it up, I pass by where he’s standing, which is in between the dry pot place and the bubble tea place. I say something like “have a happy Halloween” in his direction. I do notice the driver's glare out of the corner of my eye, but the bobarista nearby responds instead and hands me Halloween stickers, thinking I was talking to him.

I didn't disparage the driver directly or name-call, but I can understand why he got defensive. Feel free to ask questions. So, AITA?

67,1ggxm2n,AITA for having a panic attack over cat puke/poop? ,"
I (22f) moved in with my best friend (21f) this July. I’m extremely squeamish when it comes to poop/puke. From the day I moved into this apartment there has been poop on most things because her cat has a cone on. The bathroom rug, the couch, the blankets, the toilet seat covers, etc. Every time I bring up my frustrations she gets upset and calls me ableist for saying it’s nasty to live like this. Because I’m “being mean to a disabled cat.” I’m incredibly frustrated and upset. 

Today I worked from 10:00am-4:30pm and then came home and proceeded to shower, do the dishes, clean the kitchen, relax a little bit, then go downstairs to make dinner. I was met with her cat looking up at me with liquid diarrhea and litter all over the inside of his cone. She was at work so I mustered up the strength to clean it. As I was going back to put his cone on in the dining room (which is sort of dark bc the light bulb is out) I felt something wet on my feet/ankle/leg. I assumed it was water dripping from the strings used to tie his cone. I walked back into the kitchen and saw puke all over my slippers and on my ankles/legs bc it was flinging around as I walked. I FaceTimed her immediately to let her know what was going on. I suggested that we should put up a baby gate to keep his mess confined to the dining room because thats where his litter, food, and water is located. I even playfully said I would make him a nice little apartment of his own so he feels comfortable. She shut down the idea instantly and got quiet/seemed really annoyed with the suggestion. 

I hung up and ended up breaking down and having a panic attack. This is my first apartment and I feel as though I deserve a clean environment. Idk why but whenever it comes to poop or puke I feel like I can never get clean enough. I had a really productive day and just wanted my apartment to feel clean. It never does, there is constantly poop and puke everywhere. 

I’m sorry that this ended up being so long but I really need advice. She always gets defensive and irritated when I talk about how grossed out I am. I feel like I’m going crazy.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-01,"AITA for having a panic attack over cat puke/poop?

It’s not that I can’t throw together a costume. It’s the fact that I don’t want to. I told him I wasn’t going, and made plans with a friend instead. Now he’s saying that I “won’t even compromise” when I feel like my only options are 1. Scramble to throw together a costume last-minute to appease him, or 2. Let him do his thing and I’ll do mine. I told him I had plans and he should go alone, which he did not like. So, AITA?",0.0,0.04791606217622757,0,1
69,1ggx44k,AITA for going to the police about my ex’s girlfriend?,"I (18F) got together with my ex (18M) in March 2023. Let’s call him Zach. 

For some background, our relationship was amazing and I’d consider him my first love. He immediately failing classes and and skipping school at the start of the 2024 school year last September, and in late September my mother passed, both of us found her unresponsive when we went to my house after school. It was a very traumatic experience for both of us. He broke up with me in early November, after i saw cheating texts on his phone and he said that he had to work on his mental health. We ended on a bad note, and although it might be selfish, I will never forgive him for cheating on me and leaving me heartbroken at my worst and most vulnerable time. 

Fast forward to January, I’m hanging out with some of my friends at a mutual friend’s house that Zach and I both share. Zach texts our friend asking if he can come over and to stop drama from starting, he tells him I was there and to not come over. He comes over anyways, unannounced, with his new girlfriend the one he cheated on me with. As soon as she walked in the door and saw me, she put her hair up and stormed at me, shouting and treating me. One of my friends who grabbed me and pulled me into the bathroom and locked the door while she was screaming and banging on the door. Zach got into an altercation with our mutual friend, and eventually they both calmed down and left. A day later i get a DM on instagram from her account threatening me in a physical manner, and I diffuse her verbal attacks very mindfully

March, she calls me on my phone during school using a friends phone, assuming Zach gave her my number. She accuses me of still being in contact with Zach and trying to get back together with him (we go to the same school but we haven’t said a word to each other since we broke up, she goes to a school in the next town over). Trying to calm her insecurities like the people pleaser I am, I assure her I haven’t been texting him and sent  her screenshots with proof. She was very rude and threatened me the whole time, even though I was calm, but eventually she gave up and hung up on me. 

April, she texted me off of Zach’s laptop which i don’t remember unblocking.. which i ignored

And now October. Two weeks ago, I get a call from Zach’s number which shocked me, as when we broke up, I blocked every line of communication. I picked it up and said hello, but there was no response from the other end so i hung up. at this point i was livid. i call my mutual friend to ask him why and how in the world he called me. Zach claimed it was a buttdial which i find very unbelievable. The next day I get a text from his girlfriend, trying to egg on this drama, and then another text from someone unknown threatening me to leave Zach and his girlfriend alone. I’m beyond furious that all i’ve done is respect their relationship and stay as far away from Zach as I could, and she still started and continued this drama for a reason i have yet to get an answer for. I went to the police station during school when I got these texts and requested to speak to an officer i have known for a couple years. I showed him all the texts and he called down Zach to the station after I left. 

I talked to the officer after Zach left and he said that he called her and warned her if she contacts me again, she will be charged with harassment, but he told me since she lives in another town and goes to another school, and she wasn’t constantly contacting me, there really wasn’t much they could do. This disappointed me as I wanted her to see consequences for her immature actions, but there was nothing I could do. 

Zach and I share many mutual friends, and many believe I went too far going to the police and  threatening her with charges because of a “grudge” i held against her for threatening me. I lost quite a few long-time friends because of this. AITA?

80,1ggu80b,AITA for throwing up? ,"I (f18) am I freshman in college and went out with my roommate (f18) and sports team for the first time about a week ago. I ended up drinking more than I should have and my and roommate were both getting tired so we decided to leave. When we got back to the dorm I wasn’t feeling very well and asked her to grab my trash can under my desk. She freaked out asking if I was going to throw up. I said I’m not sure but I might so can you hand me the bucket. She grabbed it, put it on the floor, and kicked it to me. 

I ended up throwing up in the bucket but got up threw up some more in the toilet, cleaned out the bucket with soap and water (so it wouldn’t smell) then went back into our room to find my roommate gone. I texted her saying I was sorry and asked where she was but she didn’t respond. I saw her 2 days later at practice and we didn’t speak. She hasn’t been in the dorm room since. About a week later I get a text saying she’s moving out. I was understand and apologize many times. We had a very mature convo on both ends and are still friends because we are on the same team. 


I understand that some people have a fear of throw up, however, she does not. The day after I got the moving out text I get a FaceTime from my mom asking what happened. At this point I am freaking out because she is very strict. Turn out my roommates mother texted my mom and told her everything. This I was mad about because we are adults living away from home there is absolutely no reason parents need to be involved. I bit my tongue though and never said anything about it. And I understand that her mom texting mine is not her fault but I don’t understand the need for it. 

The issue is everyone on my team is acting really weird towards me and very friendly with her. I’m assuming she told them all about what happened and now everyone is mad at me so I’m looking for outside opinions. Am I the asshole? I know I fucked up pretty bad but is this a reason to move out and stop speaking to me? (Also this is the first this has happened it is not a regular thing. I have gone out plenty of times with the team and been fine this was just the first time with my roommate) AITA?

Edit: hey so there is some confusion in the comments so here is a little background info: 

Before this night me and roommate were very close, we told each other literally everything. We would have movie nights and do everything together. The night this happened we were having a great time dancing on tables and screaming songs. We walked back to our dorm together and were both laughing the whole way back. There were no issues before I threw up.

82,1ggtmjn,AITA for asking my fiancé to reconsider her best friend’s role at our wedding?,"I (27M) am getting married to my fiancé (26F) next summer. We’ve been planning everything together, and it’s honestly been really nice to go through this process as a team. The only bump in the road so far has been her best friend, “Lily.”

Lily is her closest friend, practically a sister to her. She’s been there through a lot of ups and downs, and they have a strong bond that I really respect. Lily’s also her Maid of Honor, which is important to my fiancé and something I fully supported at first.

But recently, I’ve started to worry about how Lily might handle that responsibility. She has a very outgoing, energetic personality—she loves being the center of attention, and she’s the type to go big in any social setting. It’s not usually a problem, but sometimes she can take things a little too far. For example, she’s hinted about making her speech “unforgettable” and has made a few comments that make me wonder if she’s planning some kind of surprise or moment that might end up being more about her than us. I know she means well, but I’m worried that her energy might take away from the atmosphere my fiancé and I want to create.

I brought this up to my fiancé as gently as I could, suggesting that maybe her sister or one of her other close friends could be Maid of Honor instead, just to keep things a bit simpler. I explained that I’m concerned about things going off-course or feeling a bit too focused on someone else. But she was really hurt by the suggestion. She told me that Lily is the one person who has been there for her during some of the hardest moments of her life, and that she can’t imagine anyone else standing beside her in that role.

Now I’m stuck between feeling guilty for asking her to make such a big change and worried about how the day could turn out if my concerns are valid. I want this day to be special for both of us, and I’m not trying to create any tension over something that could maybe work itself out.

At the time, my dad was taking our dog out so he wouldn't bark at people ringing the door. My father came back home, and was somewhat upset at the amount of candy still in the baskets. He sits down with me at our porch, and we start giving out candy, but he keeps on putting candy in the children's pillowcases/baskets/candy receptacles, and I tell him he shouldn't give kids more candy than their willing to take. I had only shown kids the candy bowl, and let them choose how much they wanted, but he'd been picking up candy and putting it in their buckets. I normally wouldn't take too much of an issue with this, but he stormed off when I told him that he shouldn't be doing that. After an hour (and getting rid of most of the candy) i come back into our house. He's still upset with me, and now I'm thinking I might have done the wrong thing. I mostly just was concerned since the children didn't seem like they wanted more candy, and what parents would think of children being handed too much candy. AITA? please help.

84,1ggsxef,AITA for not texting my GF back about a financial issue?,"I know these usually require a lot of context so bear with me...

My GF (31F) and I (26M) have been living together (no kids) almost 3 years. I own the house and she moved in with me and took over the monthly bills (40%) while I continue to pay the mortgage/taxes/ins (60%). We decided this because I make about 10k more than she does anually (and legally its 100% my responsibility).

She was comfortable with this setup but went out and financed a car Feb 2024 to replace an old one at EOL. She financed a car that is the same as her yearly salary. I was concerned yet supportive because she was starting to lose mental health over the old vehicle and didnt want to ""settle for another car over 5 years old"". She made it work, took on extra side jobs and earned an extra 10k.

Early fall she took on a college course to begin a masters degree and that took a huge toll on her savings. I am very open with her about my money and I like to check in with her too on how things are. Last few times over the past month she has claimed that her class was expensive and that her savings were lower than she was comfortable with (Under $2k) but that was all.

Last night, she got home late from a side job so we chatted about our day in bed and at a certain point she went quiet and I had a palpable feeling something was off. When I asked her about it she brushed me off and said she didnt feel like sharing her thoughts. I didnt want to press so I told her she could talk to me when she was ready and nothing more was said. 

Today, while at work I recieve a text from her asking if I could cover the utlilties and groceries this month because she was in the red from the car payment and masters course and felt like she was paycheck to paycheck.

I was a little stunned at first, but I didnt entirely know how I felt. Financially, im ok with covering it, but I was taken aback that this was a conversation she chose to have via text. At this point I didnt know what to say. So I didnt say anything... I went back to work and went on with my day.

When I arrived home at 5, I asked how she was and her response was very sullen. 

I asked if she still wanted to go to dinner like we had planned and she said no. 

At that point I said ""I was hoping we could talk"" to which she said she wasnt ready to talk to me yet because of how pissed she was at me for ignoring her and how fake I am for claiming I would be willing to help but ignoring her when she finally asked. I apologized and tried to say I didnt know how to respond to that text but she didnt seem to react so I told her I would give her some space so we could have the convo when she was ready. 

Im going to apologize again because I understand how vulnerable she had to be to ask in the first place but I cant help but feel like I wasnt given any benefit of the doubt or even processing time of my own. So

85,1ggsq8f,AITA for going the wrong way about calming my boyfriend down?,"My boyfriend (20) just got diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. I don't want to go into the specifics as it is irrevelant to this topic, but basically, he is entirely forbidden from consuming certain types of food for a few months at the very least, and he will likely be forced to keep them in moderation for the rest of his life. What started our argument was the fact that the forbidden list includes alcohol.

He was understandably distressed about his situation, however he was very specifically distressed about the alcohol restriction at the time this conversation happened. He is a pretty shy guy, and although he has some friends he enjoys hanging out with and trusts a lot, he was really worried that without the alcohol, he wouldn't be able to let himself go around them. I tried to calm him down by explaining that it's not the alcohol that makes hangouts, and that I understand his frustration, but with time, he will most likely get used to it's absence and enjoy the hangouts either way. He, however, insisted that I simply can't understand (I rarely drink or go to parties), and went on and on about how it wouldn't be the same and being drunk is an entirely different feeling. He eventually started to get personal, saying that my calming method sucked and the fact that he ""would lose alcohol forever"" wasn't what he wanted to hear, but rather he needed me to calm him down that it's gonna be fine and his issue will go away and he will be able to drink eventually. 

At this point I was getting upset, since he started bringing up my insecurities to get his point across. I tried to explain to him that I was against that method of calming him, since whether or not he will be able to go back to drinking with his friends fully is something I can't possibly know for a fact. As someone who has anxiety, I usually rather someone calms me down by rationalizing that the worst case scenario isn't actually that bad, rather than feed me with white lies and insist that the worst case scenario won't happen. He kind of agreed for a second, but kept on insisting that this was different, that he is losing something valuable forever, and it's like losing his ""young years"".

The conversation somewhat calmed, he apologized for his insults, but then, he asked me to apologize, as well. I didn't really understand what he needed an apology for, so I asked him to explain, and he got upset again, telling me to apologize for not calming him the way he wanted me to. I refused to apologize.

The way I see it, telling him what he wanted to hear would have been basically lying, and I don't like to lie. Telling him that it's gonna be fine and that he will maybe one day will be able to drink the normal amount again is kind of stupid in my eyes and goes against the entire point to be serious about his diet and his doctor's instructions. He called me insensitive, told me he wouldn't come to me when he was anxious again, told me to go f myself and blocked me.
