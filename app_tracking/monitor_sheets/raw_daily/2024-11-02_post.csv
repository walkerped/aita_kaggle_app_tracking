0,1ghog86,AITA for dressing up as a male Youtuber for halloween when I'm a girl,"I'm a 17 year old girl, and for Halloween, I decided to dress up as a male YouTuber that my friends always joke I look like. It was meant to be a lighthearted surprise since they've been teasing me for a while about the resemblance.

For some background, I grew up in a conservative and somewhat religious household. While we don‚Äôt practice our religion much, my dad (54) is very firm in his belief that anyone who doesn‚Äôt follow God is a bad person. He often says that God should come before everything‚Äîfamily, love, and friendships. Ironically, though, he doesn‚Äôt exactly follow all those religious principles himself. As he basically sins on a daily bases but uses God to indicate he is a worthy man.

Growing up, I‚Äôve always tried to be polite and follow my parents' ideals. People outside my family praised me for it, but my parents, especially my dad, often made me feel like I had a bad attitude. My relationship with him is particularly difficult.

Now, picture this: I go out for Halloween with some friends and dress as this YouTuber without telling my dad exactly what my costume is. Before we head out, my friend's parent takes a picture of all of us together. I repeatedly ask them not to show my dad the picture because I know it‚Äôll upset him.

I had a great time that night trick-or-treating, hanging out, and just enjoying the evening. I ended up staying over at my friend's house for a sleepover.

The next day, when my dad came to pick me up, my friend‚Äôs parent showed him the picture before I even realized he was there. By the time I came outside to greet him, I could already tell something was off. When I asked if he was upset, he said yes firmly, then brought up the picture.

He called me evil, accused me of being transgender, and said I was weak for letting the internet influence me. He was furious that I went against his values, even saying he didn‚Äôt want to see my face. He also threw in a lot of hurtful comments, claiming I was messing up my life and quoting things I never even said, like that I didn‚Äôt believe in God or wanted to be a Satanist.

In the end, he told me to pack up my things and that I would be staying with a family member until he could arrange for me to live somewhere else.

If I'm being honest, my main issue is how I'm going to financially achieve my projects without any sort of monetary help. I don't really care for my father, but I do need him in that aspect.

First off, I want to say a huge thank you to everyone who commented and supported me through this ordeal. I genuinely appreciated all the advice and the emotional validation that came my way. I tried my best to read as many comments as I could, and the consensus was clear: I am \*not\* the asshole!

Following the advice I received here, I made the decision not to extend the contract or lower the price. After reading the responses, I sent my uncle a message responding to his request to lower the price, saying, ‚ÄúI will take this as you declining the extension and will expect the money by Nov. 1, 2024.‚Äù Since then, it appears I may have been officially cut off from my grandma and uncle. We happened to show up at the same restaurant last week, and there was absolutely no acknowledgment from them.

Additionally, a close family member passed away recently, and no one from my family reached out to me about it‚Äîexcept for my mother. Despite the family strain, as of this morning, I officially received the funds for the house in full. That has been the biggest relief after all the stress of this past year.

For of background, I met A at school before winter break and I presented myself as a female (I'm not out at school), during winter break I posted and she replied thinking I was someone else, leading to me telling I was trans. After winter break I started to hang with her and her friends at recess, one of them being J. At that time there was S, who was A's best friend. A starts to tell me things, between them, that she and j had a thing and they weren't together but there was something and had been together before.

Summer break, still friends with them, some bad things happen with S and A, I hang with A and J, mostly with A, she tells me a lot more of things since now she doesn't have a best friend.

Start of the school year A is not anymore at school since she has a full school year of internship while I have 3 months since we are in different courses. A and J date again, A talks to me about her relationships problems, when we hang out, is mostly to talk about some problem she had with J.

3,1gi39a9,AITA for asking my long-distance partner to share travel costs?,"I (30s M) met my partner (30s M) a year ago while I was on vacation abroad in his home country and we‚Äôve kept a long-distance relationship going since. He‚Äôs in another country, and although I invited him to visit me when I had a home (even offered to host him and help pay for his ticket), he refuses to leave his home country because he feels obligated to stay close to his elderly parents, even though he works remotely and lives 2.5 hours from them.

Since then, I‚Äôve traveled back to his country and stayed for nearly two months (got an Airbnb, and he came over most nights). After losing my job (I was living in a foreign country) I‚Äôve been traveling abroad for the past 4 months trying to sort out what to do next, and I suggested that maybe we could meetup at a halfway point to spend time together, but he refuses to leave his own country (even though in theory he could as he works remote mostly). I really miss him and he has been supporting me emotionally through some rough times. Now, I‚Äôm planning another visit to him, but flights are around $1,000. Since I‚Äôm currently unemployed, I asked if he could chip in a couple hundred. He freaked out & refused, saying he doesn‚Äôt want money to come between us. He accused me of trying to take advantage of him for a free place to stay and cheap flights. And yes, after not having a job for 6 months, if I come halfway across the world to see him & he refuses to visit me or meet me halfway, it would be great to save on costs. However, I got his point and accepted it.

I was finally about to book a flight to see him again today, and I then suggested we split a hotel in the city of the airport before traveling the next day to his hometown (I'll be tired after I travel for 20 hours to come see him). He again freaked out and said he doesn't want to spend unnecessary money (he can stay with his parents next to the airport & I can't stay there because his parent don't know he is gay). He got upset, saying I always try to make him spend money.

Besides these issues, he has been helping me daily through making choices and stress induced mental breakdowns.

I am a sahm to 2 kids (4f) (1m). While I was making breakfast this morning, DH was breaking down boxes so he could take out the trash and recycling that had piled up over the last week while we were all busy with Halloween activities.

A box filled with packing peanuts got spilled when he picked it up, and one comment from him and spilling them ended up turning into a big argument about how I don't help with chores around the house. For the record, the only 2 chores we agreed would be his responsibility were dishes and taking out the trash. Every once in a while I will ask for help with changing a diaper or feeding the kids the food I've already prepared, but the 2 main chores he has are dishes and trash. I take care of their laundry, I take them places during the day for their education and entertainment (library, children's museum, etc) I try to fit a load of dishes in during nap time while our daughter eats lunch to try and help when the dishes are starting to get out of hand, and sometimes if he's particularly tired after a day, he'll ask me to help with dishes so he can go to bed. 

Unfortunately for the past week, both the trash and the dishes went neglected while we were running around doing Halloween activities with the kids.

7,1gi2i9h,AITA for not allowing my brother to move with us?,"So a bit of background my (25F) my mom (49F) and my brother (30M) all lived together in a small 2-bedroom apartment in the city. My mom and I each take a room and my brother lives in the common space. I moved in with my mom in 2018 since she lived less than a mile down the road from the college I was attending. In 2019 my mom forced my brother to move in after an accident.

During covid my mom lost her good paying job so I got a part time position at a bar near our home to help cover cost. Since classes had been moved online I was taking longer to finish my degree but I am happy to say that back in may I graduated and got a great job as a traveling nurse.

My brother on the other hand has done absolutely nothing to help either of us out and even seems to make things worse. Before the accident he was attending university and had a job but since he moved in all he's done is sit around and play video games. He sleeps all day and is up all night. He never cleans up after himself and is a slob in general. I know he didn't live like this before so I'm not sure what caused the change in him.

I will come home after days away and the house is absolutely trashed, dishes piled in the sink, trash overflowing, dirt trashed throughout the apartment. When I bring it up he always says he's too tired or he forgot. My mother is starting to get old and honestly shouldn't have to clean up after my adult brother. So I'll spend the next few days cleaning up but once I leave and come back it's dirty again.

After a lot of overtime and saving I have a decent amount for a downpayment on a house and last month I signed the papers to a nice 4 bed 2 bath house with a small 2 car garage and sits on a decent 3 acres of land. I am proud to finally have a place to call my own. I told my mom she is more than welcome to come live with me since I know she wont be able to afford the apartment on her own but my brother can't move with her because I want my new home to stay nice and I know he would just trash it like he did the apartment. She and my brother are calling me an asshole for not letting him move with us. My extended family have chimed in with the same thought but I honestly feel like I'm not.

So reddit AITA for not allowing my brother to move with us?

Edit: since some of you are asking about my brothers accident here's a quick story. Remember this happened in 2019 so like 5-6 years ago. He and one of his friends were out drinking one night and on the drive home they crashed head first into another vehicle. The girl in the other car was fine other than a head lac (we actually became really good friends after this, she was also a nursing student). My brother's friend was also fine other than a concussion and a sprained wrist. My brother on the other hand was ejected from the vehicle, cause his dumbass didn't put a seat belt on, and severly injured. He had a broken collar bone, a nasty upper arm gash that ended up getting infected, a broken femur, a dislocated hip and a fractured pelvis. After month of recovery and a year of physical therapy the doctor gave him the all clear. He has full mobility. My mother did message me about a week ago and told me he was diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety

Since I have to leave soon my good friend from the accident is going to move in to watch my animals.

During covid my mom lost her good paying job so I got a part time position at a bar near our home to help cover cost. Since classes had been moved online I was taking longer to finish my degree but I am happy to say that back in may I graduated and got a great job as a traveling nurse.

My brother on the other hand has done absolutely nothing to help either of us out and even seems to make things worse. Before the accident he was attending university and had a job but since he moved in all he's done is sit around and play video games. He sleeps all day and is up all night. He never cleans up after himself and is a slob in general. I know he didn't live like this before so I'm not sure what caused the change in him.

I will come home after days away and the house is absolutely trashed, dishes piled in the sink, trash overflowing, dirt trashed throughout the apartment. When I bring it up he always says he's too tired or he forgot. My mother is starting to get old and honestly shouldn't have to clean up after my adult brother. So I'll spend the next few days cleaning up but once I leave and come back it's dirty again.

After a lot of overtime and saving I have a decent amount for a downpayment on a house and last month I signed the papers to a nice 4 bed 2 bath house with a small 2 car garage and sits on a decent 3 acres of land. I am proud to finally have a place to call my own. I told my mom she is more than welcome to come live with me since I know she wont be able to afford the apartment on her own but my brother can't move with her because I want my new home to stay nice and I know he would just trash it like he did the apartment. She and my brother are calling me an asshole for not letting him move with us. My extended family have chimed in with the same thought but I honestly feel like I'm not.

So reddit AITA for not allowing my brother to move with us?

Edit: since some of you are asking about my brothers accident here's a quick story. Remember this happened in 2019 so like 5-6 years ago. He and one of his friends were out drinking one night and on the drive home they crashed head first into another vehicle. The girl in the other car was fine other than a head lac (we actually became really good friends after this, she was also a nursing student). My brother's friend was also fine other than a concussion and a sprained wrist. My brother on the other hand was ejected from the vehicle, cause his dumbass didn't put a seat belt on, and severly injured. He had a broken collar bone, a nasty upper arm gash that ended up getting infected, a broken femur, a dislocated hip and a fractured pelvis. After month of recovery and a year of physical therapy the doctor gave him the all clear. He has full mobility. My mother did message me about a week ago and told me he was diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety

Since I have to leave soon my good friend from the accident is going to move in to watch my animals. She is aware of this current issues and like many said I already have a security system installed.",0.0,-0.002612742828205228,0,1
8,1gi2f70,AITA for not doing enough for my mom?,"I (18F) and my mom (41F) got into an argument about my spending habits. On Thursday I went to Five Below and spent $60, I know It sounds like a lot but I rarely ever get to treat myself because I am scared of what my mom might say. I got my paycheck last Friday and that has been the only big purchase I have made. She told me it is becuase I have other important things to spend on and I asked her like what? I paid my car insurance bill 2 weeks before it was due, I already put gas in my car, and I scheduled my doctors appointment that cannot cost more than $850 (that is what I have after spending the $60) and even if it was I have $1000 in my savings for emergency. 

She then told me that I spend on unnecessary things knowing that her and my dad are struggling financially. I give them $150 every time I get paid, I get paid biweekly and the most I have gotten paid is $580. I know it might not be enough but it is not like I sit on my ass and do nothing all day. Twice a week I sweep, mop, wash dishes, and clean the kitchen. And I sweep everyday of the week. She says I am not doing enough for my little sister (10F), and maybe she is right on that, but the reason why is becuase I do not have patience for children. I have tried to help her with her homework but when I tell her she is wrong she says she is right and it drives me insane. So I offered to find her a tutor, that I will pay for, because she doesn't listen to me. 

Even after all of this she tells me I am playing the victim, that I want to be Cinderella so bad, and that I am a good for nothing. I understand she is under a lot of pressure but I can get tired too. I worked 5 days out of the week from 4-9 I then have to come back to help my sister with her homework sometimes. I go to college every Thursday from 8:30-9:50 and come back to clean the entire house then it is straight to my room to do the mountain of homework. 

I just wish she would understand I can be stressed to, I work, go to college and graduating this year, and help around the house. I would understand if I am constantly asking for help, but I drive myself to work, school and everywhere else in addition to paying for my car insurance, gas, detergent, softener, and all of my hygiene products . I have paid college off with grants and scholarships, so they do not help me with tuition, not that they would. But my brother also sends them money (he is in the military) which should help.

For context: my dad left when I was young, and K has always been more than just a brother to me. He stepped up and became a father figure, helping raise me and our younger sister (who‚Äôs 16). Because of that, K and I have this super close bond.

B and I have been best friends since elementary school. We tell each other everything and have always supported each other through thick and thin.

B always joked about how handsome K is since we were teenagers. I thought it was just playful banter at first, but lately, her actions becoming more serious. Our younger sister even made a sarcastic comment at dinner the other night about how B is totally in love with K, and that really got me thinking.

So, I started paying closer attention and realized B has been trying to get closer to my brother. She‚Äôs been casually mentioning running into him at the gym and hanging out at cafes near his workplace, and it feels like she‚Äôs making a real effort without telling me. This whole thing feels off.

Yesterday was the final straw. B came over for movie night and, in this weird attempt to show off, tried to flaunt her new tattoo (a wolf head between her breasts) to K. I was in shock. K just laughed it off. I managed to stay calm while he was there, but once he left, I lost it.

When I confronted B and told her I didn‚Äôt want her to be making moves on my brother, she confessed that she is really in love with him.

I notice two girls to my right, I make eye contact with one of them and I compliment her on her costume because she was wearing something on Halloween. We chat for a bit and I eventually get my drink, so I ask her for her number and ask her out suggesting to go for coffee or a drink another time before I head out. She gladly accepts and gives me my number. We go our separate ways.

I go to my table with my friends and it can't seat all of us as we're a big group ad it's a busy night at the bar. About 10 minutes later, I looked around to see if there were any free chairs anywhere. I spot only one chair free in the entire bar, which is at the table of the girl whose number I got who is sitting with her friends. I go over to the table to ask someone if I could take that seat.

When I got to the table, everyone was in a conversation except for her, so I asked her as I didn't want to interrupt other people in their conversation. I look at her and ask ""Is this seat taken?"". She says it isn't, so I ask if I could take the seat back with me. She says yes, so I smile and thank her, taking the seat back to my table to talk with my friends.

As I was leaving the bar to go home, I ran into the same girl, so I asked her about something separately. It then transpires that she was upset with me for taking the seat away rather than sitting and talking to her, ending the sentence with something like ""Maybe I'm just overreacting from being drunk"".

After I realised why she was upset and when I understood it from her perspective, I tried to explain that it was a genuine misunderstanding, what the thought process was from my side, and tried to assure her that I didn't intend to hurt her feelings and that I apologised if I did.

Personally, I think she's overreacting even in light of me apologising and explaining that it was a genuine misunderstanding, though I'm happy to admit if I've done something wrong and take responsibility. 

I intended to spend time with her on a separate occasion when it was just the two of us. I didn't talk to any other girls that night or ask anyone for their number.

19,1gi02g2,AITA for uninviting my best friend to my wedding,"My best friend (25m) (we will call James) and I knew each other since high school but only became friends afterwards. I (25f) got a boyfriend (26m) (we will call Alex) last year. James started making weird remarks, such as, ""don't you think Alex looks like me?"" When they look nothing alike. The only similarities they have are race and glasses. Alex and I got engaged a couple months ago and James was butt-hurt that he wasn't part of it. He asked me ""What's wrong with you"" and put his fingers to his head. He has been very passive aggressive towards my now fianc√© Alex. We both have talked to James about his actions and trying to address them but all he would say is ""I don't have a problem with Alex"" in a very annoyed and exasperated tone. 

When my fianc√© reached out  to be friends with him, each time James arrived late or canceled at the last minute. When Alex and I were planning on moving in together, James was originally supposed to move in with us to help mitigate the cost of rent. Alex and I both had time constraints about when our leases were up, and instead of helping, James always flaked whenever we made appointments to see apartments, or would schedule it deliberately during times Alex had to work. At that point James didn't have a job yet, since he just move back to town.

After we signed a rental lease without him, he made passive aggressive comments about us moving in without him, such as ""Oh, I guess you just want it the two of you"". Another time he was upset was when Alex and I went on a date together, claiming he had a panic attack because he wasn't invited. I had to explain that I wasn't going to invite him on my dates, and that he's not a part of my romantic relationship.

Now he's complaining that we didn't give him sympathy over something he could have removed himself from, and shouldn't have been a part of to begin with. I offered my help and he didn't want it, saying 'all he wanted was us to give his sympathy, even if it's false sympathy', which I do not support. You either want my help or you don't, but you're not gonna demand my attention.

I ignored it, but my fianc√©e wanted to explore the noise further. A few days later, she found the source and told me about it. It turns out that the plunger in the back of my toilet that should shut when the back of the toilet is filled with water was too short to fully cover the hole, and that allowed water to fall into the toilet when it shouldn‚Äôt, causing the water valve to kick on since it would sense that the back of the toilet was low on water.

24,1ghzi7t,AITA for asking for my money back?,"Hi everyone. Let me give you some context. A few days ago two friends (M32, F31) came to my (F31) house (they invited themselves, I didn‚Äôt suggest it).

I bought some wine and snacks and also some sweets for dessert. Before they came I told them that we would order some dinner as I didn‚Äôt feel like cooking. I paid for the dinner and when it arrived we split it equally and I told them how much they had to pay me (it was about 50‚Ç¨ between four people, not a big deal). One of them said something like ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre inviting us to dinner, right?‚Äù to get out of paying me, but I said no and he repeated the same thing about two more times, laughing.

The next day, I reminded them that they had to pay me, but they didn‚Äôt answer me and they didn‚Äôt pay. The third day after dinner I reminded them again (and already feeling bad about it, because it wasn‚Äôt a lot of money but I don‚Äôt like being laughed at). That's when they both got mad at me, telling me I'm a stingy, a penny pincher and a few other things.

I don't think it's my problem for asking for MY money, other times I've invited them or we've gone out for a drink and I've paid, but on those occasions I do it because I feel like doing it and it‚Äôs my decision. When it's the other way around, they count every cent and they're the kind of people that if they order water and you order Coca Cola at a dinner, they're going to take it into account so they don't ""pay too much"".

We are all in our 30s and have jobs, so it is not a problem of them being short of money. Besides, they are the only two friends with whom I have these kinds of ‚Äúmoney problems‚Äù, since the rest of the people usually pay when they are supposed to. Anyway, they manage to make me feel the bad person here so I need to ask, am I the asshole?

25,1ghz5fa,AITA for keeping the watch that was given to me?,"
My (15M) Grandad died last year in December, my mum was recently given two watches that my grandad used to own by my grandma. She didn‚Äôt specify which one was for whom, she just said to give me and my younger brother (12M) one each.

My mum came in holding two boxes, she had just picked them up randomly and assigned one to each of us, she had said that she would just give us each one, unless one of us had a burning desire for one of them - but if we were going to disagree on who should have which one, then she would just give us the one she had randomly assigned us. When I opened mine, my brother said that he really wanted it, but I also really wanted it. The watch my brother had been given was also really nice and was honestly worth a lot more than mine, but he started complaining that he wanted mine.

29,1ghymq6,AITA for flipping out almost every week I come back to my mothers?,"Hello, I will go by Vriska here to keep it anonymous.
To start, for years and years me and my mom have always had a conflict,it's just in our nature at this point. We both each have trust issues towards eachother and can't seem to break them. This has resulted--throughout the years of me growing up, a lot of trouble. I do not want to make my mother seem like a villain, I love her, so perceive the rest of this as you will. So, back to what I was saying, me and her have fights a lot. As a teenager, I feel like I am overreacting a lot due to hormones and that it is not right to do so. The way my mom has basically always been is she will only love me if I agree with her (which I hardly do) or only listens to what I say if it's her words. She has literally manipulated me into helping her commit fraud to be frank. Several times. And I had no idea what was going on. Anyways...she basically just spoils the shit out of me (which I appreciate) however it doesn't do anything to my depression to have more material items and less love and she doesn't get that. My parents have 50/50 custody so earlier this week I came back home on Sunday. She was away, as per usual, so I just came inside and up to my room. The reason I got frustrated with her is because she used to have an issue with staying in my room while I was away at my dads, and it made me really uncomfortable cause she always left a mess everywhere and went through my things, so I made her promise to stop. Back to what I was saying, I came back home, dropped my things off in my room and ready to rest for the night, I'm always tired when I come back, so I tend to get frustrated if there's something wrong. I came back and well, her vibrator was on the dresser next to my bed. Now listen, I don't care if she uses one...her business, but I was raised by a germaphobe (my grandma) and most certainly don't want to be in the vicinity or be aware that I am in the vicinity of something like that I guess. So, she had called me once I was back home, she always asks ""where are you"" even though she has my location.. I replied obviously ""at home"" and then got frustrated with her --""also please do not fucking leave your vibrator in my room that is disgusting, you can use one I don't care but stop putting your shit in my room"" something like that. And now I guess what irritates me is when I get mad at her and I'm not even yelling, versus when she raised me calling ""yelling"" just raising her voice, she reacts like a sad dog when I get mad at her. I get it, as a mother you just want your child to love you, but instead of apologizing every time she just acts sad and mopes around. Is it that hard to give an apology..? I am literally constantly apologizing to her, and it seems that she only apologizes to me once I admit that I'm ""wrong"" or start feeling guilty for her feeling bad, which destroys me. Like I earlier said, I do love her, but even my dad and several others in our family talk about how foul she can be to them, using them, but I want them to see her as good. In fact, even though you don't know her as a reader, please forget I said all of this, she's an angel to anybody outside of her family. She had told me once after going through my messages that I'm scaring all of my friends off when I talk about her like I do, which, I have always been very blunt.

yeah, AITA for getting mad at her for giving me no privacy when I leave?",TL;DR,2024-11-02,"AITA for flipping out almost every week I come back to my mothers? Hello, I will go by Vriska here to keep it anonymous.
To start, for years and years me and my mom have always had a conflict,it's just in our nature at this point. We both each have trust issues towards eachother and can't seem to break them. This has resulted--throughout the years of me growing up, a lot of trouble. I do not want to make my mother seem like a villain, I love her, so perceive the rest of this as you will. So, back to what I was saying, me and her have fights a lot. As a teenager, I feel like I am overreacting a lot due to hormones and that it is not right to do so. The way my mom has basically always been is she will only love me if I agree with her (which I hardly do) or only listens to what I say if it's her words. She has literally manipulated me into helping her commit fraud to be frank. Several times. And I had no idea what was going on. Anyways...she basically just spoils the shit out of me (which I appreciate) however it doesn't do anything to my depression to have more material items and less love and she doesn't get that. My parents have 50/50 custody so earlier this week I came back home on Sunday. She was away, as per usual, so I just came inside and up to my room. The reason I got frustrated with her is because she used to have an issue with staying in my room while I was away at my dads, and it made me really uncomfortable cause she always left a mess everywhere and went through my things, so I made her promise to stop. Back to what I was saying, I came back home, dropped my things off in my room and ready to rest for the night, I'm always tired when I come back, so I tend to get frustrated if there's something wrong. I came back and well, her vibrator was on the dresser next to my bed. Now listen, I don't care if she uses one...her business, but I was raised by a germaphobe (my grandma) and most certainly don't want to be in the vicinity or be aware that I am in the vicinity of something like that I guess. So, she had called me once I was back home, she always asks ""where are you"" even though she has my location.. I replied obviously ""at home"" and then got frustrated with her --""also please do not fucking leave your vibrator in my room that is disgusting, you can use one I don't care but stop putting your shit in my room"" something like that. And now I guess what irritates me is when I get mad at her and I'm not even yelling, versus when she raised me calling ""yelling"" just raising her voice, she reacts like a sad dog when I get mad at her. I get it, as a mother you just want your child to love you, but instead of apologizing every time she just acts sad and mopes around. Is it that hard to give an apology..? I am literally constantly apologizing to her, and it seems that she only apologizes to me once I admit that I'm ""wrong"" or start feeling guilty for her feeling bad, which destroys me. Like I earlier said, I do love her, but even my dad and several others in our family talk about how foul she can be to them, using them, but I want them to see her as good. In fact, even though you don't know her as a reader, please forget I said all of this, she's an angel to anybody outside of her family. She had told me once after going through my messages that I'm scaring all of my friends off when I talk about her like I do, which, I have always been very blunt. I don't think she likes that, so I guess I'm just trying to be honest without making her seem bad, this should be without bias.

30,1ghxve5,AITA for backing out on my halloween plans with my best friend,"the whole situation sounds very childish but i need more perspectives on the whole situation. to add, we're seniors in high school. 

so, my bestfriend had suddenly sprung up on us trick or treating and getting a halloween costume. i hadn't thought anything of it cause we're known to agreeing on doing things but the plans never become concrete. four days before halloween, we get our costumes. very last minute unfortunately and when half of my stuff arrived, none looked good on me and i was freaking out because this whole situation was just super unprepared and my costume looks like straight ass.

 i apologize and tell her i don't want to go out anymore because this is super unplanned and i'm just unmotivated by all of this. she tells me it's fine and so i think it is. next morning, she doesn't quite ignore me but she makes no effort to make conversation with me. i ask her if we should head to class but she's calling her friend over to ""pick her up"", as in meet her? she's never done that before. a group of our friends pop up and a few crowd over me and start talking to me while she finds a friend of hers and walks away. 

i'm a sensitive person so i couldn't really focus on what my other friends were saying and i just watched her walk off with this guy while really loudly talk about whatever she was talking about. the bell rings and she darts off into class, leaving me behind. like she just makes no effort on talking to me. i felt so embarrassed and stupid. i had to hold back tears the whole first period before i just made up an excuse that i felt sick and drove myself home. we had a football game that same day and while i shot her a text, asking if she was alright and if our friendship is alright, she was texting a groupchat that i was in, completely and totally ignoring me once again. i gave up and didn't bother anymore 

but i'm just super stressed out. i understand that backing out last minute wasn't ideal and the reason for it wasn't a good enough ""excuse"" but is it enough to warrant this kind of behavior from her? i really don't know what to do because she's all i have in school and she clearly makes it obvious that she doesn't care about me with how much she posted her having fun at the football game we were supposed to go together.",Everyone Sucks,2024-11-02,"AITA for backing out on my halloween plans with my best friend the whole situation sounds very childish but i need more perspectives on the whole situation. to add, we're seniors in high school.

31,1ghxlpv,AITAH for not answering a text during the day ,"I (54f) have an older female friend who is taking some classes at the moment. 

I‚Äôve been in a horrible work situation for the last two years, with new bosses who clearly have wanted to get rid of me. So I bust my ass all day, every day, making sure no email goes unanswered, my work stays caught up, and so on.

A few **months** ago I told her I‚Äôd help her on some of her work, but when she text me about it, it was the middle of the day, my phone was on silent, and I was working balls to the wall. When I finally saw the text, it was hours later, and I was going to text her when I left the office. Note: it‚Äôs not unusual for me to miss texts from everyone at work, including my flesh and blood.

When I contacted her, she was bawling, said I failed her, and she‚Äôd never ask me for help again. I apologized profusely and tried to explain I can‚Äôt answer some times because despite always busting my ass, some days crap goes awry and as the head of my department, I have to ensure it gets fixed. I work in healthcare, and have a direct impact on patient care. 

She‚Äôs brought it up multiple times since, and I have patiently apologized repeatedly. Until a month ago, when I told her I would be home on this one day if she needed to call. She said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never trust you again.‚Äù Around the same time, she spewed vitriol about a link I sent her, was just super pissed that I sent her this text. She frequently gets in a mood and comes across mad at me. I try to be patient, understanding it‚Äôs transference, but as I referenced above, I have been dealing with a LOT at work.

This time I just lost it and told her that‚Äôs fine she doesn‚Äôt have to trust me, and I wouldn‚Äôt bother her anymore. 

She had sent me a few sweet texts in the last few weeks so the other day I reached out, once again apologizing for not texting her that one day. 

She started in again, just that if I didn‚Äôt want to help her I should have just said that, and a text back would have been nice, but now she can‚Äôt tell me anything because I‚Äôll cut her off and she can‚Äôt wonder what she‚Äôs done. She lost her husband several years ago, and I have always allowed her to yell at me for things, basically being a whipping boy if she was in a mood, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair. 

I told her I can‚Äôt move forward if she can‚Äôt move past that. Again, i don‚Äôt always see my kids‚Äô texts for hours. When I did see her text it was towards the end of the day, and I messaged her as soon as I could.

32,1ghwnb8,AITA for always arguing with my boyfriend?,"My (24f) boyfriend (25m) always gets annoyed with me when he thinks I‚Äôm annoyed or angry then it starts an argument. Generally when I speak to my boyfriend I speak in an animated voice but when I‚Äôm tired or talking about neutral things, like work or friends, I speak in a normal voice. When I say normal voice, it‚Äôs the same way I would talk to a coworker or friend. I will admit that sometimes I can be blunt without realising. 

When he thinks I‚Äôm annoyed, he‚Äôll ask if I‚Äôm okay. I‚Äôll say that I‚Äôm fine or I‚Äôm good or I‚Äôm okay, whatever variation. But then he‚Äôll insist that I‚Äôm lying and that I am angry because of my tone or body language. This is fair enough but my problem is that even after I explain to him that oh I might sound like that because of xyz, he‚Äôll still insist that I‚Äôm angry which then makes me angry and then we end up arguing.

I‚Äôm getting more and more annoyed when he claims I‚Äôm angry now because I‚Äôve been over this issue with him so many times now. I‚Äôve explained to him that clearly our perception of things are different so when I say I‚Äôm okay, he needs to believe me because he doesn‚Äôt know how I feel better than I do.  Despite telling him I‚Äôm okay, he‚Äôll keep insisting I‚Äôm angry until I actually am angry, then he‚Äôs like, see I knew you were annoyed. Now I‚Äôm getting upset because I feel like I‚Äôm always under a microscope. Whenever I do anything other than be happy, he‚Äôs like ‚Äòoh she‚Äôs annoyed again, what have I done now‚Äô.

Our most recent argument is because him and his friend have been wanting to do a double date for a while now. They set the date about a month ago. I kept asking my boyfriend about what we‚Äôre doing so I can plan what to wear because they were talking about a casual meal or going out for drinks. So I wanted to know whether the dress code was casual or dressy. I‚Äôve been asking him this for two weeks now. The double date is today and I ask him what the final plans are and he‚Äôs saying he doesn‚Äôt know. In a monotone and somewhat fed up voice I said to him to call his friend and find out so I can start packing. 

He messages me back about 30 mins later telling me where we‚Äôre going and also saying that if I‚Äôm gonna be in this mood all day, he‚Äôs gonna cancel the plans and tell his friend we‚Äôre not going. He said that his friend‚Äôs girlfriend wasn‚Äôt mad so he doesn‚Äôt know why I am. 

I called him back and said I wasn‚Äôt mad but he insisted I was, then we argued. He‚Äôs saying I started the argument but I feel like it was him.

So my mum was lets me live at her house sometimes, and helps me out during hard times (as a Uni student). And she lets me live there rent free, which is especially appreciated during winter with the cost of heating bills.

She does has arthritis, meaning she needs regular blood tests, and she clearly says to me she can't take anymore stress. I've tried to keep this in mind constantly around her, trying my best to minimise adding to her list of problems - housework or otherwise.

* Older brother/ Me 

My older brother and I have a strained relationship.

He's charismatic and knows how to play to people's wants/ humor them, so many seem people like him. At least on first impressions. He also leads a successful career in sales. I'm the polar opposite, I'm shy and sensitive. I take it seriously if anyone hurts me and because of that I've become quite cynical:

Unfortunately my brother is a narc asshole. His charisma, his attention-seeking and the way he goes out his way to push buttons - I'm also LGBT, which he knew from my mum (I never trusted him).

One day, he made a ""joke"" at my expense. He knew it was damaging. He knew we wern't close enough to make jokes like that. But it was fine since he could pass as a ""joke"". 

That lead to a serious fight, and family rift for some time.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But lately we've lately we have been 'getting on'.  Or so he thought.  But I still wanted space from him.

So I silently ghosted him from the last time he tried to 'hang' out with me. Letting the phone ring on silent, pretending not to see his text messages.

My life felt heavy enough being a Final year student. And I still didn't trust him. I just wanted to live my life in peace.

* Present day / Incident

The trigger was when my mum mentioned I was staying at her house to my older brother. Even though I made it clear I didn't want him to know. I hid my things before he arrived, and she promised she wouldn't say a word. 

Now he's probably finding a way to get back at me for bruising his ego by ghosting him, which is why I got mad - she was creating problems for me. 

I then threatened to tell my dad # foreign exchange students she had in her house. She told me not to on previous occassions. Since it would enable my father to work out her income - as he used to be a part of it. Then get jealous (being financially better off), and pester her trying to get into her good books.

He‚Äôs fine with it because he lives there only 1/4 of the time and I live there full time. Also, I can‚Äôt move out because they won‚Äôt allow it and see it as me abandoning him.

My mom and little brother visit us often. They visited for a month recently and my little brother insisted on taking my room. My mom slept with my dad and I was asked to share a bed with him. I don‚Äôt want to, obviously. Which 22 year old wants to share a bed with her 14 year old brother for a month? He moves a lot in his sleep and I can‚Äôt sleep peacefully. I slept on the sofa for the entire month and I got called difficult, selfish etc the whole time.

Now, my family wants to visit again in a few months and obviously I asked about the sleeping arrangements (got called annoying for even asking) I asked if my mom and I could share my bed and my brother sleeps in my dads room with him. My brother refuses to. He wants to sleep in my room because it‚Äôs bigger, which I don‚Äôt understand and it upsets me that my mother will force me to allow it. I don‚Äôt have my own choices even though I live far from home.

Am I the asshole? They‚Äôre coming for only a week but I still don‚Äôt want to sleep in the same bed with my brother. I don‚Äôt understand why he can‚Äôt sleep with my dad‚Ä¶ my dad would also have to move to my room. I also will be working, taking classes, going to the gym regularly when they‚Äôre there so it‚Äôs difficult for me. I struggled a lot the month they were there because I barely got any sleep.

I feel like other parents would have boundaries and have younger siblings respect their older siblings‚Äô space. I think the only way they would respect my space is if I got married. Everyone in my family gangs up on me and makes it out as if I‚Äôm the problem so I‚Äôm genuinely confused. 

Edit: My dad is with my mom more than half of the time. He is with me only around 1/4 of the time because he lives there only when he travels for work. It‚Äôs not the only time they get to see each other. 

Edit 2: I suggested my brother sleeping on the couch but they wouldn‚Äôt even consider it and got mad at me for suggesting. If I downsized to the smaller room, my brother would still want to sleep in the master bedroom because he ‚Äúlikes that bed‚Äù and my parents wouldn‚Äôt get to sleep together either way.

Edit 3: Culture is a big aspect. I‚Äôm south asian and it‚Äôs nothing like western culture. I can‚Äôt simply move out. I‚Äôm not sure how to insist he takes the couch either.

I don‚Äôt want to, obviously. Which 22 year old wants to share a bed with her 14 year old brother for a month? He moves a lot in his sleep and I can‚Äôt sleep peacefully. I slept on the sofa for the entire month and I got called difficult, selfish etc the whole time.

Now, my family wants to visit again in a few months and obviously I asked about the sleeping arrangements (got called annoying for even asking) I asked if my mom and I could share my bed and my brother sleeps in my dads room with him. My brother refuses to. He wants to sleep in my room because it‚Äôs bigger, which I don‚Äôt understand and it upsets me that my mother will force me to allow it. I don‚Äôt have my own choices even though I live far from home.

Am I the asshole? They‚Äôre coming for only a week but I still don‚Äôt want to sleep in the same bed with my brother. I don‚Äôt understand why he can‚Äôt sleep with my dad‚Ä¶ my dad would also have to move to my room. I also will be working, taking classes, going to the gym regularly when they‚Äôre there so it‚Äôs difficult for me. I struggled a lot the month they were there because I barely got any sleep.

I feel like other parents would have boundaries and have younger siblings respect their older siblings‚Äô space. I think the only way they would respect my space is if I got married. Everyone in my family gangs up on me and makes it out as if I‚Äôm the problem so I‚Äôm genuinely confused. 

Edit: My dad is with my mom more than half of the time. He is with me only around 1/4 of the time because he lives there only when he travels for work. It‚Äôs not the only time they get to see each other. 

Edit 2: I suggested my brother sleeping on the couch but they wouldn‚Äôt even consider it and got mad at me for suggesting. If I downsized to the smaller room, my brother would still want to sleep in the master bedroom because he ‚Äúlikes that bed‚Äù and my parents wouldn‚Äôt get to sleep together either way.

Edit 3: Culture is a big aspect. I‚Äôm south asian and it‚Äôs nothing like western culture. I can‚Äôt simply move out. I‚Äôm not sure how to insist he takes the couch either. My mom keeps talking about how ‚ÄúI‚Äôve changed‚Äù and how ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to share beds with them anymore‚Äù. I genuinely think she will just tell him to get on my bed and I can‚Äôt just shove him off because he‚Äôs heavy (I tried moving him away from me when we used to share) My 30 year old sister doesn‚Äôt see an issue with this either and they all think I‚Äôm strange for finding it weird.",0.0,-0.007185882888734341,0,1
37,1ghucq7,AITA for wanting my (F29) friend(F36) out of my flat?,"In June 2024, I saw a desperate message from my friend ""A"" in our group chat. She'd been through a lot‚Äîrelationship ended, career troubles, and kicked out by her friend. She needed somewhere to go. My boyfriend (26M) and I rent a small two-bedroom flat, using one room as an office and storage space. We cleared it out for her temporarily until she got back on her feet. She‚Äôd pay a third of the rent and bills, and we‚Äôd keep groceries separate. It wasn‚Äôt ideal for three, but we wanted to help.

At first, things were okay. A found a job and planned to move out by October. She‚Äôs not on the lease (neither am I‚Äîonly my boyfriend is), but I reassured her that if she needed a bit longer, we‚Äôd work it out. That might‚Äôve been my mistake. Since she moved in, it‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ exhausting. A‚Äôs life seems to be constant drama, from man issues to friends clash, to work problems. I‚Äôve tried to support her‚Äîcomforting, helping her through panic attacks‚Äîbut it started to wear on me. Eventually, we talked, and she cut back on oversharing, but our friendship felt colder.

Then, she adopted a stray cat. We already have two cats and a dog, so another pet made things cramped.

Now it‚Äôs November, and things have worsened. My boyfriend and I both work partially remote, so we need our office back, but that‚Äôs where A is staying. She got fired from her job‚Äîwhich I saw firsthand, as I work there too. Her approach was chaotic, though she believes it was harassment. Now, she makes offhand comments about me ‚Äúspying‚Äù for my manager. It honestly stings.

Money‚Äôs also a stress point. Despite income from side jobs and unemployment, she‚Äôs hinting she might not be able to pay rent. My boyfriend was really upset by this. Our rent is affordable. It‚Äôs hard to believe she can‚Äôt afford it.

This has impacted my relationship with my boyfriend too. We‚Äôve started arguing more, not just about her, but because of the general tension. We feel like our lives are on hold. We‚Äôve gently suggested helping her find a new place, even offering to assist with moving. She always responds with anxiety, saying we‚Äôre putting her in an impossible spot. It feels like guilt-tripping and makes things tense.

Now, I feel trapped. She‚Äôs my friend, and we‚Äôve shared a lot, but her staying here is affecting my relationship, my job, and my peace of mind. She won't talk about leaving anymore, so we are ready to give her a deadline to move out. But after reassuring her at the start, I feel conflicted. I know she‚Äôs been through a lot, and part of me feels guilty. Am I wrong to ask her to leave? Am I the asshole for wanting to put my relationship and mental health first?

38,1ghu7vf,AITA for telling my brother to go back to school? ,"I 18m have a brother 13m. This happened before they got off for Halloween but it was brought up again. 

When he was walking to school in the morning he got into an incident. As he explained it to me and as I remember it. When he was crossing the road he stepped in front of a car and there was a bit of a near miss. And when he heard the car getting close he tripped moving forward and landed on his arm and had a couple small cuts here and there. 

The driver then shouted at him to stay there, parked up and got out and berated him for a while. Shouting in his face that he‚Äôs stupid, repeatedly telling him to stop crying and then recorded my brother on voice notes admitting it was all his fault before leaving also got my brother to tell him his name and the driver said he‚Äôd be phoning the school later to tell them what happened. (Though apparently the car might have been speeding slightly does still sound like my brothers fault) 

So my brother walks back home after that and tells me everything and says he‚Äôs not wanting to go in. And is in a bit of a state because he says he‚Äôs got two exams on that day which are very important and also he‚Äôs just a bit shaken by the whole thing.

Also I have the issue that if he doesn‚Äôt make it into school I have to text or phone our mum, or dad but preferably mum. Because she‚Äôd want to know and would get mad at me if I didn‚Äôt tell her. I tell him I have to tell our mum and he begs me not to. I say I have no choice because the school will send a text to say he‚Äôs not in and I‚Äôm also not lying for him and telling our mum he‚Äôs sick. But if he goes to school right now before registration is over, there‚Äôs every chance that guy was just talking nonsense about phoning, I‚Äôm left out of it and I don‚Äôt have to tell anyone and nothing happens. And tbh I just wanted left out of it all, even if I told our parents I thought they‚Äôd maybe get mad I didn‚Äôt encourage him to go back if it turned out to be all fine. So I just didn‚Äôt want involved in the slightest. 

So that‚Äôs what he does, but apparently his arm was actually worse than expected and our parents found everything out because my mum had to take him to the hospital and my brother told her everything that happened including when he walked home. When she asked why he went back to school he said what I told him for some reason. 

She then gets livid at me for doing that, in fairness I think she was taking out some anger on me because she was really worked up over this driver who we never found out who it was and he never phoned in. Saying how awful it is for someone to do that etc. but also I shouldn‚Äôt have forced my brother to go back and I‚Äôm such a terrible person for doing that etc (not her exact words but she was really mad)

39,1ghu52s,AITA for kicking my friend out of my apartment ,"I (23f) come from a somewhat wealthy family and my parents have always helped my a siblings and I financially. I got my bachelor's degree at 21 and have a relatively well paying job. I have a best friend (24f) we'll call her ""Emma"". 

A few months ago moved into my 2 bedroom own apartment in a suburban area. Emma a week after call me and asks to crash for some time as her boyfriend had kicked her out and she had no where to stay. I asked her if she had asked her parents or any of her siblings to help her and she said she wanted to live with me since we are closer. She also said in her words ""Friends are supposed to be there for each other, why can't you just help me Besides its only for a little while."" 
I agreed to let live with me for a while while she gets her stuff sorted out.

Ever since she moved in Emma: 
- Does not pick up after herself, there are dirty clothes and dish's everywhere. I am always making the effort to keep my living space clean and she just messes that up. 
-She has expressed a dislike for my cat and even once let it out in the hopes that it gets lost or never comes back. 
-She doesn't contribute to the apartment and does not seem to want to get a job.She has a business management degree so I'm assuming she can atleast apply for some jobs with that. 
-She steals my stuff for example wearing my tops and even using my makeup. 

I asked Emma how far she is with getting in a better position and she said told me that she's not ready yet and she will move out when she gets her stuff in order. I reminded her that I only agreed for a short while but it has been 3 months already.She shut me off and went to the bedroom. 
The following day I called my sister (26F) to come and talk to Emma. Long story short a friend fight ensued (verbal), Emma saying all sorts of things like ""You are just born with a silver spoon in your mouth and have no idea about reality and how life is"". She ended up packing up her stuff and leaving. 

Now our mutual friends are telling me Emma is posting stories on Instagram and shaming me and my sister. Some friends are calling me cruel for kicking her out at a low point in her life while some are saying Emma needs to learn responsibility.

She initially agreed on the hourly rate but asked to increase two times and now we are at 2.5 times what we initially offered and way above what other helpers charge. It was ok because she did a good job. Then she claimed that she needs more hours. So we doubled her hours. She was also allowed to try different days and times but I told her that in the end I want a fixed day. After a year she wanted to switch the day again to Thursday and also adjust the time. She used to start out on the morning but getting up early is not her thing and she wanted to start working at/ not before 10a.m. we made that happen even if it meant the upper floors are ""blocked"" 2 hours after we return home. Now some things on her family have changed and she wants to switch again. She says it's so she can start her weekend earlier to visit her parents, who got sick and her grandkids, who used to be no contact until recently etc. 


I am reluctant and to be honest don't want to switch yet another time. After we settled on the day I arranged our weekly schedule around it, changed my work from home days (I can't focus if I am not alone) etc. I feel as if I had already compromised enough by giving her more then double the standard market rate plus doubled her hours plus she was allowed to pick out the day already two times. The slot we are currently having just works best for us. My brother's wife however said I am an ahole because i could just rearrange and reschedule our week and make it happen. Me not being able to focus if there is someone outside my office vacuuming or asking me questions is just me being a diva. She claims it's cruel to keep the helper from her family. AITA?

","My friend recently got evicted because she was struggling to keep up with rent. She asked if she could crash at my place for a while until she finds a new apartment.

Now she‚Äôs telling mutual friends that I let her down and that I don‚Äôt care about her problems. Some of them are saying I should just let her stay for a couple of weeks and that I‚Äôm being selfish. I get that she‚Äôs in a rough spot, and I feel for her, but I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to put me in this position.

45,1ghs5en,AITA For Not Helping My Coworker ,"I (29F) am an RN at a hospital. My coworker (35M), who I usually get along well with, was assigned to a patient I‚Äôd had over the weekend. For context, the patient was in an isolation room for lice, was agitated, and would frequently throw his legs off the bed.

When I had the patient a couple of days prior, I‚Äôd noticed he‚Äôd get aggressive if we tried to reposition him before he was calm. My approach was to give him his prescribed sedatives, wait about 10 minutes for him to settle, and then reposition him. During the time I had the patient, no one realized he had lice; this was discovered on a day I was off. Now his lice issue has worsened to the point where they‚Äôre crawling on the bed.

So, when my coworker asked me to help reposition the patient right after he‚Äôd given him the medication, I hesitated. I admit, I didn‚Äôt want to go into the room with the lice situation, but I also thought it would be best to give the meds a little time to work so the patient could settle down. I told my coworker to give it a few minutes, but he was insistent on doing it immediately. I offered to go grab one of our nursing assistants (41M), who‚Äôs bald, to help, but when I returned, my coworker had already found someone else who wasn‚Äôt familiar with the patient.

For added context, earlier in the shift my coworker and I had joked that the patient should‚Äôve been assigned to one of our bald coworkers since he's less likely to get lice. 

After that, he gave me the silent treatment for the rest of the shift, which was unusual since we usually chat often when we work together. I tried to give him some space, but I wanted to clear the air and address what had happened. When I tried to approach him later, he outright ignored me twice. 

Later, he posted something on social media about people ‚Äúleaving him hanging‚Äù and ‚Äúnot offering help,‚Äù which felt directed at me, even though he knew I'd gone to get the nursing assistant for assistance. My coworkers are split on the situation. Some think I should‚Äôve helped because he would have helped me, while others (who are familiar with the patient) agree that he could‚Äôve waited for the meds to take effect or for the NA to come and assist, as it wasn‚Äôt an urgent situation.

47,1ghrigi,AITA for refusing my roommate's 11PM shower curfew after she wouldn't move her hour-long makeup routine out of our only bathroom?,"I (F) share a bathroom with my college roommate (F). This is our second year living together, and we have become friends.

Today I was planning to shower before going out when my roommate went into the bathroom to get ready. She typically spends about an hour in there doing hair and makeup. I asked if she could do her makeup in her room instead since I needed to shower. She refused, saying she had ""already claimed the space"" and her stuff was set up. After a brief argument where I pointed out she could do makeup anywhere while I can only shower in the bathroom, I gave up and said I wouldn‚Äôt shower, but said we should should discuss it for the future.

She said if we were going to talk about that, we needed to talk about the times of day that I shower.  

She said that I'm ""home all day"" and should shower earlier before she‚Äôs likely to get home (I do take one less class, study at home, and work mornings, while she works evenings or studies at the library). She says she often comes home when I happen to be showering when I could‚Äôve done it hours before, and then she has to wait 30 minutes on me. Then she said she thinks I intentionally time my bathroom use to inconvenience her. 

The reality is:

- she doesn‚Äôt have a consistent schedule, so I don‚Äôt actually know when she‚Äôs coming home. 
- I shower late because I like to finish my work, walk my dog one last time before bed, and shower after. 
- something I want to point out, when she showers before me, I regularly wait over an hour without complaint (45 minutes in shower + 20+ minutes for skincare/teeth)

She claims I time my bathroom use deliberately, citing ONE time when I texted asking when she'd be home (it was late and I was genuinely curious since we're friends), she replied that she was on the way, which I had read as I was getting in the shower. In no way did I intend for that to happen, it just did, and I wasn‚Äôt going to jump out bc she was almost home. She's also upset that maybe 6 times in two years, I've knocked to quickly use the toilet during her hour-long bathroom sessions. This morning proved my point when I had sudden and VERY urgent diarrhea during her post-shower skincare routine. Instead of letting me in, she took an extra 5 minutes and accused me of ""holding it"" until she's in the bathroom. 

She's completely unwilling to budge and insists I need to change the time of day when I shower so that she‚Äôs not having to wait. When I mentioned that my less than 30 minute showers are much shorter to wait on than her hour-long routines she snapped and said ""we're not putting time limits on the shower.""

How should I handle this? AITA for asking her to do her makeup elsewhere since I can only shower in the bathroom, and then disagreeing with her shower schedule?
 
Edit to add: 
- my average shower times are more like 15-20 minutes, and this is the time from when I walk in the bathroom, and walk back out, so including teeth brushing. 30 is a bit of an overestimation on days that I‚Äôm doing an ‚Äòeverything‚Äô shower. The point was more to compare her shower length of time to mine which is much shorter.

- I live in an on campus upperclassmen dorm. Housing basically will not do room switches unless your life is being threatened, so I think I‚Äôm out of luck there. She isn‚Äôt living with us next year though, so I‚Äôll just have to try to see if we can resolve everything so we can get through the year. I‚Äôm not too optimistic though..

52,1ghptwl,AITA for thinking that my brother is ignoring me over a boy?,"I (17m) have a brother (15m) that lives in another country, so our comunication in only via online (ig, dc, tt, wp, etc). I'm not gonna lie, he's not the best person if we talk about comunication with other people, we both are autistic if that has something to do with enything, but we have talked everyday for the past 4 years, since covid actually and with me is the most sweet little guy that could exist, i spoil him sometimes and always listen to them and try to give him advices, but I've never been the most social guy and most of the time don't know what to do. He is the only person i really talk to beside my boyfriend beacuse all my friends are online and we talk not so often, so he's my only real friend, and i know I'm mostly his.

Whatever.

About a month ago he broke up with his online boyfriend of year and a half. that relationship was toxic and co-dependent on each other, but he finally had enough and broke up with him without feeling bad about it, and that's great, because he had suffer a lot with that guy. my brother isn't the victim tho, he had told me he had a lot of toxic behaviors towards him too. the thing is, that two nights ago he started to feeling bad about him, that he misses when his ex-boyfriend treated him nice, that he miss the way it feels to be in a relationship that I cannot make him feel, because I'm his brother, not a patner. I told him that's a normal feeling because of course it is, and I know he's very dependent on people.

  
We made a deal, where he cannot have a online partner, because being honest, not seein someone would eventually broke every releationships. But that night he insisted me that if he can talk to someone on instagram that lives on the same country and relatively close to him, reluctantly i said yes because i don't want him to get hurt again, he has my instagram and he has mine, so i could see if something sus happened between them.

  
Here's the problem, since that night he basically haven't talk to me, i send him messages and he doesn't respond while i see that he talks with that guy, when he acctually send me something, he does not respond to any to the things i send him, and talk about that guy only. I know he can talk to other people, and that he has a life outside me, and it's good for him to have other people to talk to, but i feel excluded, and I feel that I'm being so damn jealous and ""toxic"" somehow for thinking of telling him that he's been texting him more than me. When I partially tell him about this, he just said that he thought he answered me, and said he was busy, but he still only talk to that boy for like 4 hours and not even seen my texts. Today, he didn't even said hi to me or told me anything, just one-word-reply like ""okay"" or  ""cool"", even to questions.

  
i dont want to sound or be possesive, when i know i might be sounding like that, but i just miss my little brother that talk to me and that told me everything, I feel excluded and ignore. I know he's a teenager now and they're more distant, and he even told me he has been feeling angry towards everything. I have no one to talk to about this because my friends doesn't really care about him and my boyfriend is kinda jealous of him(? (that's weird, i know) so i just need some external opinion.

53,1ghpt96,AITA for being mad that I have to take care for my friend at the club ,"I (20f) am on Erasmus in France right now. Went here with another girl (let‚Äôs call her Ana) from my university. I knew before but we weren‚Äôt really close. She‚Äôs a very sociable and nice person but when she drinks she can‚Äôt really control herself, both with how much she drinks and also how she acts. 

At first I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was because I haven‚Äôt been out clubbing with her before leaving the country, but now that we‚Äôre here her problem makes me not want to go out anywhere with her, especially to any clubs. 

All of our trips to the club (we share the same friend group so it‚Äôs not really possible to not go out with her) end up with her being drunk, getting lost in the crowd, throwing tantrums not listening to any of us, running away, and me having to leave early to take care of her. She usually doesn‚Äôt remember any of the things that happend after drinking. 

To be clear I wasn‚Äôt salty about it at first, I get it everyone can overdo it sometimes but I haven‚Äôt gotten a thank you or anything really. It‚Äôs also been happening everytime we go out for the last two months, to the point I do not enjoy going out because I feel responsible for her and have to keep my eye on her. I tried talking to her about it, that I also want to have a calm evening where I can enjoy myself and let loose, but she said I don‚Äôt have to worry about her and she doesn‚Äôt understand what I mean. 

Fast forward to the Halloween party last night. I was extremely excited for it I made a costume and went there with our friend group, but was hanging out mostly with a girl I‚Äôm seeing. My roommate (another girl we will call her Lily) wasn‚Äôt feeling well. I wasn‚Äôt aware of that being in a different part of the club.

I asked Anna to come with me (we live in the same building) because it looked serious and I didn‚Äôt want to be alone and she said yes. We got out of the club I ordered an Uber and Anna said she‚Äôs going back in and left me and Lily outside. We got in the car and drove home. I was sitting quiet most of the ride feeling suddenly feeling sad and so pissed off, not at Lily but at the fact that I had to take care of someone and didn‚Äôt get any help from Anna.

54,1ghppzk,AITA For Selling Tickets Instead of Giving Them To Family?,"10 years ago my brother and I went in on season tickets for our college football team. We don't live close enough to attend consistently so each year I make the effort to sell the tickets and we make a small profit. I do all the work and split the profit with my brother since he splits the cost. Sometimes we are able to attend a game and essentially pay for our own way with the profit from other games. 

This year, our school is renewing a rivalry that's been dead for a little over a decade. It's a big deal. The game is a home game and the tickets are selling for record prices. We have 4 seats so we decided together that we would use 2 and sell 2. The money is too good to pass up and having that memory together will be incredible.

Without discussing it with me first, my brother made the decision to invite our sister. That puts me in an awkward position with 1 ticket left. Which is difficult to sell by itself. I explained to him that I won't allow this. It's not fair to me to leave me with a single ticket and it goes against our agreement. He agrees with me but our sister is now upset with me because I'm the reason she isn't able to go with us. 

Tonight she confronted me. Told me that she was willing to contribute financially (but refused to give me a number) and told me ""I can't take it with me"" and that the experience we share together is more important than the money I could make. My wife and I recently found out we are unexpectedly having a 3rd child and need to buy a bigger house as a result. So the money actually does matter to us right now. I told her multiple times during the conversation I was uncomfortable and she kept pushing. Things stayed relatively civil but I reached the point I couldn't handle it and excused myself. 

She thinks I care more about the money than including her.

My brother on the other hand, has been in and out of jail and rehab since he was 15, can‚Äôt keep a job, and doesn‚Äôt pay rent. When it comes to us three siblings, all anyone in my entire family really fixates on is my brother. I don‚Äôt get it. We‚Äôre both adults.

Except that‚Äôs not really an excuse on his part bc he‚Äôs a 20 y/o man and has everything he needs to be successful‚Äî a loving upper middle class family, food and a bed always available to him for free, and access to free education. 

I try to empathize with my mom, that‚Äôs her son, so if it hurts me to see him struggling with his mental health and substance use, I can imagine it hurts her a thousand times over. The constant histrionics get to me though. The obsession with his issues eclipses my accomplishments, but more importantly, it makes an unstable home for everyone including for our youngest sibling, who is 6 and autistic.

58,1ghp0ny,AITA for calling my ex childish for blocking me?,"So recent break up and living with an ex. I was blocked on everything email, phone, social media for sending a text on a day in which she was out of the apartment all day and expressed wanting no contact.

For context, the text was a photo of our dog as we typically send each other photos when we are away from home. I didn‚Äôt see me sending dog photos as trying to communicate or even have a conversation. 

She took that as me crossing her boundary and blocked me on everything. This was a few days ago and I didn‚Äôt even notice. 

Today come and we are talking in person about splitting finances and shopping for stuff for the apartment on Amazon. I told her I texted her yesterday the portion of what she should be paying and items to purchase on Amazon. She tells me she never received the text. I resend the text for her to say she didn‚Äôt get it. Now confused, I ask her, ‚Äúdid you block me?‚Äù She says oh yeah I forgot. I don‚Äôt think too much of it and we continue looking to make the purchase on Amazon. 

I also emailed her today some Amazon items for our dog. She tells me she didn‚Äôt get it. I fwd the same email and ask my ex to check her spam. She says again, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get it‚Äù. Now annoyed, I ask her ‚Äúdid you block my email too?‚ÄùShe says ‚Äúoh yeah I didn‚Äôt remember I did do that‚Äù

At this point it feels like either she‚Äôs trying to rub it in that she blocked me, or at the very least wants me to know that she did it. I called her actions childish because it doesn‚Äôt make sense to block someone you have shared responsibilities (dog, bills) with especially when she is choosing to still live together until the lease is up.

Am I the asshole?

",Not the A-hole,2024-11-02,"AITA for calling my ex childish for blocking me? So recent break up and living with an ex. I was blocked on everything email, phone, social media for sending a text on a day in which she was out of the apartment all day and expressed wanting no contact.

For context, the text was a photo of our dog as we typically send each other photos when we are away from home. I didn‚Äôt see me sending dog photos as trying to communicate or even have a conversation. 

She took that as me crossing her boundary and blocked me on everything. This was a few days ago and I didn‚Äôt even notice. 

Today come and we are talking in person about splitting finances and shopping for stuff for the apartment on Amazon. I told her I texted her yesterday the portion of what she should be paying and items to purchase on Amazon. She tells me she never received the text. I resend the text for her to say she didn‚Äôt get it. Now confused, I ask her, ‚Äúdid you block me?‚Äù She says oh yeah I forgot. I don‚Äôt think too much of it and we continue looking to make the purchase on Amazon. 

I also emailed her today some Amazon items for our dog. She tells me she didn‚Äôt get it. I fwd the same email and ask my ex to check her spam. She says again, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get it‚Äù. Now annoyed, I ask her ‚Äúdid you block my email too?‚ÄùShe says ‚Äúoh yeah I didn‚Äôt remember I did do that‚Äù

At this point it feels like either she‚Äôs trying to rub it in that she blocked me, or at the very least wants me to know that she did it. I called her actions childish because it doesn‚Äôt make sense to block someone you have shared responsibilities (dog, bills) with especially when she is choosing to still live together until the lease is up. 

She says I have no room to call her actions childish as I overstepped her boundary by sending a single photo as a dog update and says I‚Äôm being mean and I‚Äôm the one that‚Äôs childish.

59,1ghoyvs,AITA for complaining about a pregnant teacher? ,"I'm taking AP Psych this year as a junior. Since I'll be applying to colleges next year, maintaining good grades this year is vital.

AP Psych been an issue on that front, mostly because the teacher made some controversial choices. For example, at one point, there was a written exam where the average score was 30% according to her, and nobody I had talked to had gotten above 40%. She said she graded the test like the official AP exam would, but obviously, if every single person did shitty, she didn't teach it properly.

Another choice she made that was controversial was replacing an exam with an 'art project' in which we have to make a series of drawings representing the concepts of the unit. She then proceeded to make the artistic merit of the drawings-- shading, lines, etc-- worth 50% of the grade, and as a result, most people again didn't do well. 

I voiced to some friends that this was stupid. We aren't taking an art class, so as long as the material is correct and there's basic neatness/effort shown, why does artistic merit even matter? I said we should complain to the principal about this, and my friends agreed, so we got 50+ signatures saying she's incompetent and needs to go. 

Some other students say we're an AH for complaining about her because she's currently pregnant, but pregnant or not, I think she's harming the students' transcripts. AITA?

60,1ghooac,AITA for telling my husband I don't want to attend his grandmother's funeral? ,"My husband's grandmother passed away recently. I am sad for him and his family and have been checking in and asking how they're doing and if they need anything. The only people I have seen in person since it happened are my husband and SIL. Both of them have been operating ""like normal"" (as in, back to work the day after it happened) and have said they're ok. But I know grief isn't always immediate so I'm continuing to check in.

My MIL decided she wanted to wait until the spring to have the funeral because of all the upcoming holidays. Today she told us that the funeral will be in another state (husband's grandmother lived locally and will be buried here, but other family members live in this other state) over mine and my husband's anniversary weekend. I felt an initial twinge of, ""Why our anniversary, of all possible dates?"" when she told us but I'm over that now.

However, I am still hesitant to attend this funeral, for the following reasons:

1. We have two autistic children (ages 3 & 5). The idea of pulling them out of school and disrupting their routine, flying to another state, and then trying to keep them well-behaved at a funeral sounds like a recipe for disaster. My husband will want to comfort his mother and other family members and I'm afraid he won't be able to do that if our children are present. Just him and me going to the funeral and leaving our children behind isn't an option, as we haven't found reliable childcare that is able to handle two autistic young children.
2. I don't receive PTO at my current job or bereavement leave of any kind. I'm on a temporary contract (that I would like to become permanent) and I'm afraid that taking time off to travel and attend this funeral could jeopardize my ability to keep my job.

My husband is pretty angry with me over this. He says he will need my support at the funeral and his kids are part of the family and should be there to grieve with the rest of the extended family. I absolutely understand where he's coming from, but I also know there's a 100% chance of at least one of our kids (if not both) losing their shit and having a meltdown at the funeral (and probably many times throughout the travel process) that will just add stress to the situation. If you've never experienced an autistic child meltdown - it's not like a regular tantrum. You can Google if you need an example.

I feel that overall, it would be better for both our kids and everyone else who is attending the funeral if the kids and I stay home and don't attend.

Recently I got very good grades and was praised by everyone. I have always been a good student and I get straight A's. This is something I feel that my sister has always been jealous about. We never spoke about it but I could feel it in the way she acted when someone praises me. The problem started this year after I got my results. I got good grades (the best in my school). This set my sister off. She didn't even congratulate me well it only felt like passive aggression. My mother also noticed her behavior had changed and I talked about it with her. She agreed with me and shared that my sister had always been like this since childhood. That even though my parents treated us equally she'd get jealous anytime I get praised for my hard work. But this time is different. She is a grown 22 y/o. She's acting immature imo. The copying thing started off with the basic things like doing her makeup like mine, copying my outfits, talking like me and overall acting like me. What set me off was when she stared watching animes. She had always made fun of me for watching them. And I confronted her because we had the rule set up. We argued and she acted like a victim again. She started being passive aggressive about my grades. Idk how it had anything to do with it. And recently she cut her hair like mine. This is frustrating me. Idk why she has to steal my individuality to get validation. She should try making her own name instead of beefing with a teenager at her grown age. I am so frustrated that idk what to do. I can't even talk with my parents because they will brush it off as a childish quarrel between siblings. Pls tell me what to do.





EDIT: so I found that many people are only focusing on the""gate keeping rule"" and not the actual problem here. I mentioned the gate keeping thing just to let y'all know about how she started going against the rule she made herself. She still doesn't let me do the same. 





Only some of you responded to my actual question and I'm very thankful. 



I also think that how we are raised is one of the main problem. To give you more context, in the country I live in, getting good grades is the most important thing in a kid/teenager's life here.

I empathize with everyone like that and I have never looked down on my sister for that either. But I think she hates me regardless of how much I try to make our parents and relatives see her achievements as well. She probably thinks I'm only pitying her or making fun of her. 
We are only growing apart this way and honestly I feel like I shouldn't have gotten good grades and I wish I was an average kid with no expectations tolling upon me.

I have never visited Japan, and have also expressed interest in visiting, he knows this. I automatically assumed, if there was a first time trip, I would be able to share this experience with him, especially him knowing my love of travel and the significance of a Japan trip to him.

To my surprise, his first international trip was a trip to Colombia, during his birthday with friends. Not going to lie, my feelings were hurt because it was his first international trip, and I wasn‚Äôt involved. But I was excited he was now traveling and we can begin sharing experiences. 

I then find out that he‚Äôs planning a trip to Japan with those same friends. I lose it. I expressed to him that there‚Äôs a significance with the trip to Japan and it was something I was hoping we would share and experience together, a symbolic milestone.

64,1gho8rn,AITA for ubering myself to a job interview when my mom refused to take me,"I (19F) have been job hunting for a while now.

To preface this: my mom (55) and my brother (24) are both working, me and my sister graduated high school a few months ago and i have been job hunting as soon as i got my diploma. My father (63) isn't very active in my life but keeps contact via phone. I had an interview for a local burger place today.

I do not have a drivers license because both of my parents told me I need to google it and learn how to drive myself and they will not help me; I have finished all of the schooling needed but only via an online course because the only person who actually cares if I can drive is my brother who is busy.

My family struggles financially, even if my mom refuses to see this. Every appliance here is somewhat broken save a few things like the dishwasher and microwave; there are holes in the floor that my mom literally broke her leg on tripping over, the furniture is torn apart and the paint in basically every room is very chipped and old. We spend most of our money on bills, soap every once in awhile, pet food (bc my mom refuses to get rid of the many animals we have), and food.

I'm autistic, but i don't like admitting it because others often judge me because of it; and i struggle to keep my hygiene in a presentable standard for my mother. I only barely know how to straighten my naturally poofy n frizzy hair; and I do not own a lot of nice clothes. however my mother saw my outfit and screamed at me, yelling about the fact that ""YOUR NOT READY FOR A JOB IF YOU CAN'T STRAIGHTEN YOUR HAIR"". She tried to do it, but got even more upset when I had to let the cat in first; she said ""FUCK THIS!!"" and refused to take me to my interview. My brother was tired and had to work again, so she effectively almost cut me off.

I was desperate, so i ordered an uber with a bit of cash that i got this year. I had been 5 minutes late to my interview because of this.. I have another interview this weekend, and stupidly i got a chicken sandwich from a nearby wingstop due to stress from the interview that didn't go very well which i regret.. So i called my mom to get me. She screamed at me about how disgusting and terrible i was, how hard this was on her and how selfish i was for getting a chicken sandwhich for myself when she was hungry. She told me I was crazy, needed medicine and to see a doctor (which I've been telling her i needed for years.), and how this was my dad's fault and how HE needed to take me to the doctor because i was a lunatic. She insulted my hair and my outfit, and ensured it was as painful as possible by saying ""YOU. NEED. TO LEARN. SELF. CARE.. REEEE."" over and over again slowly.. She told me i didn't need a job because i was unfit for society. I would go more in detail but It's hard enough remembering this.

Since then, I haven't been able to stop crying. It's hard to keep optimistic and I'm scared for the one i have next. I just wanted to help, but maybe I am crazy. ATIA?

I only barely know how to straighten my naturally poofy n frizzy hair; and I do not own a lot of nice clothes. however my mother saw my outfit and screamed at me, yelling about the fact that ""YOUR NOT READY FOR A JOB IF YOU CAN'T STRAIGHTEN YOUR HAIR"". She tried to do it, but got even more upset when I had to let the cat in first; she said ""FUCK THIS!!"" and refused to take me to my interview. My brother was tired and had to work again, so she effectively almost cut me off.

I was desperate, so i ordered an uber with a bit of cash that i got this year. I had been 5 minutes late to my interview because of this.. I have another interview this weekend, and stupidly i got a chicken sandwich from a nearby wingstop due to stress from the interview that didn't go very well which i regret.. So i called my mom to get me. She screamed at me about how disgusting and terrible i was, how hard this was on her and how selfish i was for getting a chicken sandwhich for myself when she was hungry. She told me I was crazy, needed medicine and to see a doctor (which I've been telling her i needed for years.), and how this was my dad's fault and how HE needed to take me to the doctor because i was a lunatic. She insulted my hair and my outfit, and ensured it was as painful as possible by saying ""YOU. NEED. TO LEARN. SELF. CARE.. REEEE."" over and over again slowly.. She told me i didn't need a job because i was unfit for society. I would go more in detail but It's hard enough remembering this.

Since then, I haven't been able to stop crying. It's hard to keep optimistic and I'm scared for the one i have next. I just wanted to help, but maybe I am crazy. ATIA?

Story: just married 6 months ago.  My husband and my parents are on somewhat strained but civil terms. My parents wanted me to marry someone rich and I eloped after 3 years of dating a blue collar man. I don't regret it.  My parents were so mad at me dating him and my dad at one point told me my now-husband can't go on his property.  Anyways, fast forward to us actually biting the bullet and getting married. I live 2 hours away from my parents and my mom says she won't come visit me unless she spends the night at my house. I offered to buy her a hotel room and she got so offended. It's just awkward situation between my husband and my parents. He is civil and will attend major family get together as with me but otherwise there really isn't much communication.  My sister married a rich man and my parent were so supportive and opened their house to him. 
I feel bad because I do love my mom, but I do think a little space is healthy. I also feel manipulated that she won't even come visit unless she spends the night. I do day trips to visit them at least every month or two.  Any advice is appreciated.  My husband says he doesn't trust them and he has good reasons.

My dad started to berate her till she was close to having a panic attack. We left. The next day my mom told my dad to apologize and he gave me a half-assed apology in my opinion.

She got very upset and blamed my gf for me not going, even though my gf said it was my choice. My sister texted me insisting I was being manipulated and controlled, and used other mean words to describe my gf. My mom then uninvited me. 

Before Christmas my sister texted me inviting me to a gift exchange. Before I responded I tried to go visit my parents to try and mend things, my mothers reaction was very selfish and she didn‚Äôt seem to care that they were disrespectful to my gf or me. She was the victim in all of this because she was robbed from seeing me.
I decided to limit my contact. When I tried to respond to my sister to hash things out she continued to say rude things about my relationship and we have not spoken since. My dad did apologize again to me and my gf which we both accepted. 

Eventually a family member was in town and I met in a public place to see them along with my parents, and sister. I told my mom I had a ring and planned on proposing.

Some backstory...I come from a pretty mentally abusive household and split family. My friend at the time became like a sister to me and her family ""adopted"" me. Said friend went off the rail for a couple years and I was there to support the family. As a gift to them, I offered to help them get a car. Her dad is disabled and her mom doesn't drive (but she works) and their car has just bit the dust. I was 18 when I decided this.

On my birthday, we went to get the car. I was stupid and didn't pay attention to what was being said but everything was put in my name. We had originally agreed on me being a co-signer. ""Dad"" had traded in his broken car for $300 toward the new one and put $1000 down. Upon getting home, we agreed that $150 payments would be given to me every month to pay for the car since the loan was in my name. 

The first couple months, they paid on time. But then they started skipping months or paying $40 but showing off new things they got, including action figures, weed, perfumes, and other things that I didn't think they truly needed. At one point they gave me a bag of change and said it was all they had and they'd get me the rest later.

Fast forward about 6 months, I got rear ended in a car accident and my car was totaled. The insurance company gave me a rental and an estimate on what they would give me for my car, which was enough to pay off the car I'd previously gotten for ""dad"" and ""mom."" I considered looking at cars and using the money as a down payment, but I was living on my own, paying rent and all my bills, plus driving an hour to work and an hour home. I talked with quite a few people who said I should take the car back and just use the money to pay it off. I had about a week left with my rental when I decided I was going to listen to what they said. By then, a payment hadn't been given to me in a few months and I was making payments from my own pocket, which made me have to decide between paying rent or getting groceries multiple times.

The day I took the car back, ""dad"" said I should get him a cheaper car to replace the one I was taking and they would continue making payments. I didn't trust him to keep his word and took the car back. Since then, the whole family has made me out to be a horrible person who screwed them over and ruined their lives. At first, I really didn't think I was in the wrong because they didn't keep their word on making payments to begin with...But recently I found out my former friend is pregnant.

I (F34) have an older half-brother (39) that I'll call Will, that I have had a very complicated relationship with since we were children.  His mom and our dad got divorced when he was 3. Our dad dated around for a year before he met my mom, and I showed up eighteen months later. When we were young we got along alright but around the time Will turned 12 he started being mean, mostly normal sibling stuff, my things would go missing when he was at the house, if there was a snack or a treat I wanted he'd take it just because I wanted it, I got blamed for a lot of things I hadn't done and I'd get punished. And it was all very confusing for me because suddenly my older brother who I wanted to spend time with wanted nothing to do with me. By the time I was a teenager it was just easier to avoid him, talk to him as little as possible, and stay out of his way when he came to visit. There were still pointed comments about the way I dressed, my weight, how annoying I was, and when I'd get upset it became a race to the bottom to see how quickly he could make me cry. I gave up by the time I was 18 in having a relationship with him. He'd made it clear he didn't want me in his life, and I didn't really want him in mine either. 

We see each other once a year at Christmas and stay as far away from each other as possible.

My aunt did ask why I didn't attend, and I was honest in that I didn't think he actually wanted me there and it was better for both of us that I didn't.

Which led to a very awkward phone call from Will this afternoon. He wanted to know why I was telling people he didn't want me at his baby shower, I'd been invited hadn't I? Why would he have invited me if he didn't want me there? Why do I have to ruin everything by making it about me?

I told him that I was sorry but nothing about our relationship for the last twenty years has suggested that he wanted me to come. I didn't attend because I wanted him to be able to enjoy the day, and he hadn't been bothered by my not attending until now so I assumed it was only because someone else had asked him about it that he cared at all. At which point I hung up.

Our dad dated around for a year before he met my mom, and I showed up eighteen months later. When we were young we got along alright but around the time Will turned 12 he started being mean, mostly normal sibling stuff, my things would go missing when he was at the house, if there was a snack or a treat I wanted he'd take it just because I wanted it, I got blamed for a lot of things I hadn't done and I'd get punished.

76,1ghmsr2,AITA for not giving my own doll to a costumer?,"Hello! Well, I'll try to explain this briefly, but with all the necessary details:

I'm a doll collector and sometimes I buy limited edition dolls to resell in my country, since I understand a bit of imports. Back in September 2023, I bought a specific doll for $100 and sold her with a profit of around $20 each (I sold 2 and kept 1 to myself). One buyer payed in installments during the next 2 or 3 months, and asked me to keep her in my suite with the international shipping service I use until March, when he finally paid for the actual shipping to Brazil.

Unfortunately, when the doll arrived, I was in the middle of a crisis (flood) and forgot to pay the taxes for the doll. The doll then was sent back to the US. This process takes months, usually up to a year, and I told the buyer that. I said I was profusely sorry, that there was a problem with the product and that it would return. I told him that it would take months and offered his money back, to wait, or to have my unboxed doll instead. He was frustrated and angry but ultimately agreed to wait. This was in May.
He eventually asked me for the tracking number and I provided, then he got angry that I didn't pay for the taxes (I'll admit, I made a mistake and was ashamed) and demanded that I paid for full shipping. Even though it'll be like $55 plus taxes, I agreed. It was my mistake, after all.

Now, 5 months later, he contacted me again and said he's done waiting and that he wants the doll ‚Äî my doll, the one I'd offered before. I tried to calm him down but he said that he doesn't know the state his doll will arrive in or if it'll even arrive. I said in that case I'd give him his money back, but he says he doesn't want the money, he wants the doll. I was hesitant to agree to send him my doll, because it's been 1 year since its release, and the doll is now worth around $260 boxed. Even mine, unboxed, is worth around $180.
Well, he's been bullying me and pressuring me to send him my doll, saying I had offered it to him before, but I think I have a right to change my mind, same as him. I even sent him the money back, but he demands I give him the doll immediately, since he knows he can't buy her for the same price.

I love preparing all sorts of dishes, especially because my boyfriend is such a foodie. He's always eager to try whatever I whip up in the kitchen, which makes cooking even more fun for me.

Recently, my boyfriend surprised me with this incredible scrapbook. Turns out, he's been keeping track of every meal I've made for him, and this wasn't just any scrapbook. It was detailed with pictures of each dish, him enjoying the food, and even some shots of me cooking. Each entry had a little note about the meal, dated and everything. He's been secretly putting this together for two whole years!

He also wrote this heartfelt letter saying how much he appreciates my cooking, how proud he is of my culinary skills, and how much he loves me. Honestly, it was so touching, I teared up a bit.

When I showed it to my family, expecting them to find it as sweet as I did, they got upset instead. They were mad that I've been spending so much time cooking for my boyfriend and not for them.

Several weeks where I was on late, the group of girls would vanish for hours. This often lead to me being held up after work and having to stay behind. If the manager was WFH, the girls would scarcely be in the lab, leaving me and another guy to do everything. It was a high capacity workload and we were extremely stressed. One day, the other lad wasn't in, and I was left for 45 minutes alone while the girls went on lunch break together (despite the rule that two people were required in the lab at peak times.) They began taking extra breaks throughout the day, going over the allotted time on their lunch breaks and, when the manager was WFH spending a ton of time in her office, claiming to be doing admin work. I entered once to ask for help and found 3 of them cuddled up on one chair. The computers were off and there was no paperwork out. I felt like it was putting more stress on myself and the other guy, but one of the girls in this group was also my best friend. I hung out with her frequently and didn't want to dob her in it.

So I let her know that it was bothering me and that I felt like this was putting a lot of stress on us. She apologised and said this would be sorted (she was also technically the lab senior) but it never was. I brought it up one more time to her, but once again, nothing changed.¬†

So the girl who was my close friend mentioned that they were going to sneak out and go for a coffee. She asked me if I wanted to come,¬† I agreed. We were not supposed to leave the lab unmanned. We got back about 20 minutes later. The manager found out about this. The following day, I was called up to speak to the manager who raised concerns that I had not been pulling my weight in the lab, and that it had been noted to her that I had left the lab unmanned and left work to go to costa. I admitted I did this, but explained that I was not the only one who had gone. I did not mention names, but expressed that lack of professionalism and general lack of productivity was a lab wide issue. I wasn't trying to get anybody else in trouble. But I didn't want to be a scapegoat when I wasn't even a main perpetrator. The manager mentioned that it would be brought up in the team meeting.

I went back to the lab and told everyone the whole story. The others in the lab got angry with me, called me a snitch, my close friend said our friendship was done, that she could lose her promotion over this, and that I had betrayed her trust. Even the other lad in the lab who wasn't involved with any of this (which I told the manager), called me sly and said I handled this in the complete wrong way.

If the manager was WFH, the girls would scarcely be in the lab, leaving me and another guy to do everything. It was a high capacity workload and we were extremely stressed. One day, the other lad wasn't in, and I was left for 45 minutes alone while the girls went on lunch break together (despite the rule that two people were required in the lab at peak times.) They began taking extra breaks throughout the day, going over the allotted time on their lunch breaks and, when the manager was WFH spending a ton of time in her office, claiming to be doing admin work. I entered once to ask for help and found 3 of them cuddled up on one chair. The computers were off and there was no paperwork out. I felt like it was putting more stress on myself and the other guy, but one of the girls in this group was also my best friend. I hung out with her frequently and didn't want to dob her in it.

So I let her know that it was bothering me and that I felt like this was putting a lot of stress on us. She apologised and said this would be sorted (she was also technically the lab senior) but it never was. I brought it up one more time to her, but once again, nothing changed.¬†

So the girl who was my close friend mentioned that they were going to sneak out and go for a coffee. She asked me if I wanted to come,¬† I agreed. We were not supposed to leave the lab unmanned. We got back about 20 minutes later. The manager found out about this. The following day, I was called up to speak to the manager who raised concerns that I had not been pulling my weight in the lab, and that it had been noted to her that I had left the lab unmanned and left work to go to costa. I admitted I did this, but explained that I was not the only one who had gone. I did not mention names, but expressed that lack of professionalism and general lack of productivity was a lab wide issue. I wasn't trying to get anybody else in trouble. But I didn't want to be a scapegoat when I wasn't even a main perpetrator. The manager mentioned that it would be brought up in the team meeting.

I went back to the lab and told everyone the whole story. The others in the lab got angry with me, called me a snitch, my close friend said our friendship was done, that she could lose her promotion over this, and that I had betrayed her trust. Even the other lad in the lab who wasn't involved with any of this (which I told the manager), called me sly and said I handled this in the complete wrong way. After a very unproductive team meeting with finger pointing and blaming, my friendship with these people was lost permanently.

84,1ghlucr,WIBTA for skipping the family holidays?,"I (20F) am currently working and studying across the country from my family. Last month my dad (46M) took my brother (10M) out of middle school for truck driving, leading to CPS getting involved. My parents are currently separated again, and have a long history of domestic abuse where law enforcement had to be involved. My mom (41F) is upset with the whole situation. There will be court proceedings coming up during the 2 week holiday break I have. I also have a sister (17F) that is studying out of state that will be visiting home those times. 

Honestly I'm tired with this whole mess and am given a way out. My boyfriends family invited me to stay with them for the holidays. Only issue is that I feel like I'll be imposing on their family, they already allow me to spend weekends and smaller holidays with them.

I feel like an asshole but I don't want to come home for 2 weeks and spend time with my two younger siblings being manipulated to spend time with either mom or dad, and also be there while court stuff plays out. I don't even know if my brother will be in my home town during those two weeks as he's with my dad truck driving. 

Before when they tried divorcing the first time, I was 16 years old, they both made me translate and fill out divorce papers (their English is weak). And last year during holiday break it was a nightmare as my brother kept wanting to see both my mom and dad and they both tried to keep him, and he'd cry when they'd argue and the cops were called (on each other). He even would say he wishes he wasn't alive so parents wouldn't have to worry about him. I couldn't do much in the situation, no matter how much I tried to deescalate it. My sister would also get mad at me when I wouldn't side with her. I think the whole situation is fucked up and should be avoided, while she thinks doing something will affect it.

Funny, on new years eve they ""got back together"" and tried to celebrate as a family and cook dinner but my sister was so done with their bullshit she started yelling at them to grow up, then we went to sleep early and skipped new years.

85,1ghlqeq,AITAH Referred to construction workers by their nationality ,"I am having my kitchen and dining room redone as part of a home renovation. At the start of the project the contracting company sent two men to do the initial demolition work and get the project started. After having met both of them, I learned that they did not speak English, but rather Russian and Ukrainian, so they were not easy to communicate with.

After the demo work was completed, the two workers attempted to continue the renovation, drilling multiple holes in beams to rout plumbing, installing tacky board on which tile would be mounted and other items to move the project forward. A week later a different crew was brought in and I realized the work these two did after the demo stage was now being redone, as whatever they were doing was incorrect. They also did took down a load-bearing wall and did not install any temporary framing for weeks, until a city inspector came by and let them and me know that they need to put up temporary framing to avoid the second story from collapsing. It was like they thought they could follow the blueprints like Lego instructions and were not qualified to proceed with the steps they embarked on. That was just about the last time I saw either of them working on the project.

And everything was fine without the temp framing, but it could have been a disaster.

Fast forward 2 months and the owner of the company reaches out to set up a call to get my feedback on the overall project, problems we‚Äôve had, what can be improved, etc. I appreciated the gesture from a customer service standpoint.

During the call I mentioned that I was not happy about ‚Äúthe work the two Russian or Ukrainian guys did that was then redone because it seems like they sent two people to my house that didn‚Äôt know what they were doing.‚Äù

I relayed the conversation to my wife and she told me it was unprofessional and not appropriate to refer to them that way. And had it been a problem at my own workplace, would I have referred to someone by their nationality (eg the German or the Indian person or wherever they are from. I work at a multinational corporation with employees all over the world). I agree with her on that point, but I also would have access to everyone‚Äôs name through the work email directory, so I would not do that at work. I think she is concerned with the company thinking we are racist white people, but I did not use their nationality as a derogatory label, but as the best way I had to identify them. I could have also said the guy with the ponytail or the guy with the beard, but who I was referring to would not have been as clear. 

So AITAH? Is it inappropriate to refer to someone by their nationality?

My grandparents knew, but that‚Äôs because I was living with them at the time as my husband just got out of the military and we were saving before purchasing. Also, for context, my grandparents raised me so they are like my parents.

The argument just kept getting worse and worse to the point now that we all have each other blocked. My mom was also mad my mother in law came to the house. My mother in law lives 20 minutes away, my mom lives in the state over a few hours away. I also asked my brother in law to come help hang a tv, so mother in law tagged along. It wasn‚Äôt like I hosted dinner. 

She even mentioned how I am selfish that I have said whenever I have kids I don‚Äôt want anyone to come to the hospital. To clarify, I am not pregnant and not even trying to get pregnant. But her and my grandma don‚Äôt get along well and equally hate each other and I get put in the middle of that hate.

That he thought that a get together that our friends have routinely, with people we don't know, and without telling some of our closest friends, was the best route. And 3.

 My wife and I and two sons had moved into a new house that we were coerced into paying a damage deposit to secure for a place that isn't finished yet.
 
 They were adamant about getting us in for the middle of the month, so we were told to pay to secure the place. Packed all of our stuff and put it in a Uhaul and left.
 
 About two hours into the four hour drive, the property management company had called saying they couldn't give us the keys because there was no power/heat or hot water hooked up yet. After delegating with them, she got a technician to come over and re route the gas from the downstairs suite to the upstairs unit as the top gas utility wasn't hooked up. 

 We waited three days for them to do this while living in the house. Also, the rental unit was not the one we were supposed to move into. This partucular unit has a downstairs suite, and it's an end unit. We were told the middle unit was the one we were moving into, and it had no basement suit(no tenants)

 We already paid the rental company 2100 for damage deposit and 1050 to secure the place for the middle of the month, which is the rate for a middle unit with no downstairs tenants. We were temporarily staying in the end unit until they got the middle unit ready as this one was ready first.

  We had the majority of our stuff put in the garage and just had the beds and essentials in the place. They had discounted the half months rent for the trouble and hardship this has caused my family. 

 After being in there for about a month, we finally got to the middle unit. The buyer had told us that they were going to hire movers for us because of the inconvenience. They did not hire anyone and expected us to move everything again to the other unit. So I did.

 Now that we got into the middle unit, there still isn't power to the garage door. There is a noticeable difference in upstairs and downstairs temperature, especially in our kids' rooms. 

 They were rushing to complete these houses and were trying to secure renters all the while the buyer wasn't releasing funds to the builder, so the builder wasn't finishing things.

Did all the driving to the places we went to since he doesn't drive(including back to his place for a different pair of shoes when his broke). 

When we got back to my house, I was changing outfits to go the the bar's karaoke costume party. I invited him calling because he asked if anything adult was going on that night. In the 30 minutes it took me to change my outfit and do the makeup look for it, he apparently helped himself to some of her candy, including the only full size bar she picked out that night. 

I had no idea he did this until this morning when I was sorting through her candy bag. I texted both him and my mom who'd been with us and he said ""oh yeah. I ate it. I'll get her a new one.""

I told him I wasn't going to entertain that with a response and that he needed to figure out what he did wrong. He tried to call me but I didn't pick up.

I mean,am I wrong to be upset here? The point was it wasn't his candy to just help himself to, he could've at least asked. Even her daddy and I ask her first before we grab a piece of her candy. AND it was her only full size one on top of that..

96,1ghjyxw,WIBTA for not going to the family BBQ?,"I, 22 F, have a family on my dad‚Äôs side which is a little dysfunctional.

Basically, my dad‚Äôs brother Ron  and his partner Cheryl have both treated our family terribly since they‚Äôve been together. 

Cheryl is simply an awful person. Ron has always had issues and has caused the family problems but until she came around, he was never an outright asshole. It seems Cheryl has changed his personality to the point where he has burned every bridge with every family member. Legend has it that Cheryl was shitty to her own family aswell and has stopped speaking to them, so it‚Äôs not exclusive to just our side of the family. 

Back in 2019 there was a huge falling out between Ron, Cheryl and my parents. Apparently there was a text conversation happening in a big family group chat. I saw the texts; the conversation was completely normal. Cheryl and Ron sent a photo of their daughter playing outside in a pool and said something like ‚Äúour little girl loves playing in the water‚Äù. My mom then responded back with ‚Äúhaha my own daughter does too except she‚Äôs in a tub instead of a pool‚Äù, just making a joke. Pretty normal stuff right? Cheryl and Ron then say ‚Äúwhat is wrong with you? We don‚Äôt want that visual. How dare you. You sound so creepy‚Äù and basically went on to say a bunch of awful things about my mother being creepy towards her own daughter (me) which made no sense to anyone including me.

Something you gotta understand about my mother before we go any further: she‚Äôs helped Cheryl and Ron so much through the years, she is completely selfless. So for them to randomly say things like that felt so awful. However, my parents were also smart enough to know they were being targeted and were now on the ‚Äòfamily we randomly hate now‚Äô list. 

Ron has since tried to stop talking to or tried to argue with my grandparents (his parents), his sister (my aunt), and some other relatives for no apparent reason.

So since then we haven‚Äôt seen or spoken to either of them. We have had 0 interactions. Now, that brings us to the actual issue:

My grandfather called us a few weeks ago and brought up the idea of a family BBQ‚Ä¶.a family BBQ where EVERYONE would be there. As in Ron and Cheryl too. Me and my parents all looked at eachother like üëÄüëÄ . My grandfather basically wants just 1 time where the entire family is together again before he passes away, since he‚Äôs old. 

There hasn‚Äôt been a set date for this BBQ to be had, but now that the seed has been planted, I‚Äôm assuming a date and time could be set up at any point now. I‚Äôm just waiting for the ball to drop. And when the ball does drop I have a choice to make; do I go or not? 

On the one hand I‚Äôd feel awful if I didn‚Äôt go and my grandfather didn‚Äôt get his 1 wish. Our family being torn apart has torn him apart over the years. On the other hand I feel like if I went I‚Äôd probably get into an argument with Cheryl/Ron and ruin the entire thing.

So WIBTA for not going to the family BBQ? ",Asshole,2024-11-02,"WIBTA for not going to the family BBQ? I, 22 F, have a family on my dad‚Äôs side which is a little dysfunctional.

Basically, my dad‚Äôs brother Ron  and his partner Cheryl have both treated our family terribly since they‚Äôve been together. 

Cheryl is simply an awful person. Ron has always had issues and has caused the family problems but until she came around, he was never an outright asshole. It seems Cheryl has changed his personality to the point where he has burned every bridge with every family member. Legend has it that Cheryl was shitty to her own family aswell and has stopped speaking to them, so it‚Äôs not exclusive to just our side of the family. 

Back in 2019 there was a huge falling out between Ron, Cheryl and my parents. Apparently there was a text conversation happening in a big family group chat. I saw the texts; the conversation was completely normal. Cheryl and Ron sent a photo of their daughter playing outside in a pool and said something like ‚Äúour little girl loves playing in the water‚Äù. My mom then responded back with ‚Äúhaha my own daughter does too except she‚Äôs in a tub instead of a pool‚Äù, just making a joke. Pretty normal stuff right? Cheryl and Ron then say ‚Äúwhat is wrong with you? We don‚Äôt want that visual. How dare you. You sound so creepy‚Äù and basically went on to say a bunch of awful things about my mother being creepy towards her own daughter (me) which made no sense to anyone including me.

97,1ghjvur,AITA for telling my girlfriends mum she was drinking?,"Me (m19) and my girlfriend(f18) have been dating for a whike now and she isnt very.. open, she dosent like talking about things when she has things on her mind.

A few days ago she said she was going out to a party which i let her go since i didnt mind her having fun with friends for a while and i had some college work to get on with.

Halfway through the night she starts messaging me voicenotes to ny whatsapp saying things such as ""i cant breathe"" and ""i feel like im dying"" and other silly things you say, i knew she had drank quite alot since she is genreally a really nice and just calm person.

so at this point i was worrying for her like bad, since most of the people there were the same and i tried calling her to go home( i dont live nearby) and as you do she wasnt understanding and speaking absolute nonsense so i knew she was a few too many deep, i decided to message her sister and her mother and tell them what she had been doing and that i was truly worried she would end up doing something that could of harmed her.

A few days after this she found out that i was the one who as she likes to say ""snitched"" on her she was furious and tbh, i felt like such an idiot about it since i myself have done this before and been fine the next day.

Did i worry too much or did i do the right thing in the situation?

98,1ghjp75,AITA for quitting mid season?,"I (20F) was the head coach of a high school team, this was my second season coaching this team. My first season went great, the athletes and I got along great. There was a couple hiccups here and there, but by the end of the season the girls believed in me and they trusted my judgement. As a coach I am very straight forward and tell it how I see it. 

Flash forward to this season. The school hired a new assistant coach for me and her and I got along great for the first couple of weeks, but it wasn't too soon before she started treating the athletes like her best friend and being quiet inappropriate with them (swearing with them, telling them stories about her ex and her new boyfriend, etc). After she started getting very close to the athletes they stopped listening to me and would only listen to her, so I started to take a step backwards because I didn't want to push the athletes too much. 

Soon into the season the assistant coach would start to make jokes about one of the heavier athletes calling them a hurricane and laugh every time this athlete would compete. I didn't know what to say because I was flabbergasted she would do such a thing. 

The athletes would constantly go up to the assistant coach and say they wish I was not the head coach, and they would go to their parents stating I said very inappropriate things (which I did not say). I started to feel defeated because I would constantly get emails from parents that were over 1,000 words stating how bad of a coach I was and I was doing everything wrong. 

After multiple talks with the AD I started to ask the athletes what I was doing wrong and no one was giving me an answer. This drug on for two months before the AD told me the assistant coach and athletes do not want me to be at practices anymore. I got an email from a couple parents stating I was being very rude to the assistant coach and I was treating her like garbage. Throughout the seasonI asked the assistant coach multiple times what I could do differently and what I could do to help her out, she never responded. 

It got to the point where it was over half the team that was against me, so I told the AD I could not coach anymore and I quit, for the better of the team and my mental health. When I told my assistant that I was done coaching she said ""thank you.""

A couple days after I quit, I was getting messages from the athletes stating the assistant coach needed help writing practices and I needed to send her my practices. I didn't want to be mean so I sent them to her. But now I am getting messages from athletes and parents stating I am a horrible person for leaving the team mid season.
