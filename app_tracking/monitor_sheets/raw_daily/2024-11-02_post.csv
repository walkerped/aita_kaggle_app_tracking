0,1ghog86,AITA for dressing up as a male Youtuber for halloween when I'm a girl,"I'm a 17 year old girl, and for Halloween, I decided to dress up as a male YouTuber that my friends always joke I look like. It was meant to be a lighthearted surprise since they've been teasing me for a while about the resemblance.

For some background, I grew up in a conservative and somewhat religious household. While we don‚Äôt practice our religion much, my dad (54) is very firm in his belief that anyone who doesn‚Äôt follow God is a bad person. He often says that God should come before everything‚Äîfamily, love, and friendships. Ironically, though, he doesn‚Äôt exactly follow all those religious principles himself. As he basically sins on a daily bases but uses God to indicate he is a worthy man.

Growing up, I‚Äôve always tried to be polite and follow my parents' ideals. People outside my family praised me for it, but my parents, especially my dad, often made me feel like I had a bad attitude. My relationship with him is particularly difficult.

Now, picture this: I go out for Halloween with some friends and dress as this YouTuber without telling my dad exactly what my costume is. Before we head out, my friend's parent takes a picture of all of us together. I repeatedly ask them not to show my dad the picture because I know it‚Äôll upset him.

I had a great time that night trick-or-treating, hanging out, and just enjoying the evening. I ended up staying over at my friend's house for a sleepover.

The next day, when my dad came to pick me up, my friend‚Äôs parent showed him the picture before I even realized he was there. By the time I came outside to greet him, I could already tell something was off. When I asked if he was upset, he said yes firmly, then brought up the picture.

He called me evil, accused me of being transgender, and said I was weak for letting the internet influence me. He was furious that I went against his values, even saying he didn‚Äôt want to see my face. He also threw in a lot of hurtful comments, claiming I was messing up my life and quoting things I never even said, like that I didn‚Äôt believe in God or wanted to be a Satanist.

In the end, he told me to pack up my things and that I would be staying with a family member until he could arrange for me to live somewhere else.

If I'm being honest, my main issue is how I'm going to financially achieve my projects without any sort of monetary help. I don't really care for my father, but I do need him in that aspect.

1,1ghnlo1,UPDATE: AITA for kicking my uncle out of ‚Äúhis‚Äù house?,"Hello everyone,

First off, I want to say a huge thank you to everyone who commented and supported me through this ordeal. I genuinely appreciated all the advice and the emotional validation that came my way. I tried my best to read as many comments as I could, and the consensus was clear: I am \*not\* the asshole!

Following the advice I received here, I made the decision not to extend the contract or lower the price. After reading the responses, I sent my uncle a message responding to his request to lower the price, saying, ‚ÄúI will take this as you declining the extension and will expect the money by Nov. 1, 2024.‚Äù Since then, it appears I may have been officially cut off from my grandma and uncle. We happened to show up at the same restaurant last week, and there was absolutely no acknowledgment from them.

Additionally, a close family member passed away recently, and no one from my family reached out to me about it‚Äîexcept for my mother. Despite the family strain, as of this morning, I officially received the funds for the house in full. That has been the biggest relief after all the stress of this past year.

Again, thank you all for the advice, support, and truth checks I needed.",UPDATE,2024-11-02,"UPDATE: AITA for kicking my uncle out of ‚Äúhis‚Äù house? Hello everyone,
