0,1giu9fr,AITAH for ignoring my husband ,"Am I wrong for getting mad when my husband sees his mother. My husband (33M) and I (38F) have been together 13 years and married 12. He was my brothers best friend in school and later as adults we connected.
When we first got together we lived with his mother because she lived alone. In the beginning we all got along fine until I set boundaries. She would not take rent and asked that we keep the house clean. I refused to clean up behind her and her dogs. She would let the dogs tear things up and she would leave it in the floor. I would clean up behind my husband and myself but not her or or dogs. Neither she or I worked at the time.
After some loud arguments she told my husband I had to go but he could stay. When he told me this we both left. His choice. This was close to the end of the year. We were roommates with some friends until we found a place of our own but had not changed our mailing address.
In the commotion of all the moving teicr so close together we did not change our mailing address. (Huge mistake) 
My mail was going to my parents and his to his mothers. My mother gave me my tax documents to file my taxes and when asking his mother about his, she always said they hadn't arrived yet. After a while we forgot. The next year we were married and I remembered his taxes from the previous year. His mother said she never received his tax documents. We called the IRS to try to explain when we learned his taxes were in fact filed and his refund was deposited into an account, his mother's!!! I was livid! We needed that money for deposits to get our own place. (We borrowed the money from my grandparents and paid them back)
When we confronted his mother she said she owed taxes that year and could not afford to pay so she filed his taxes her self and had the money deposited into her account to help pay what she owed. (Still unsure of the total amount) 
We also found out that she had told  her and my mother's church family that he and I were selling drugs and that's how we could afford to move. When my husband confronted her, she denied this but too many of the church family told us this for it not to be true.
Our first-year together was hard enough without being judged by people I've known my whole life.
We had many set backs that year but still managed to make it.
Going back to the tax situation. I wanted to press charges but he did not. It's his mother so I let it go. We were not married that year and I had no say in the matter. 
Still now years later it works my nerves when he goes to see her or I hear her on the phone with him. I don't want to talk to him or be around him when I know he's talked to her or been to see her. 
She has never apologized or seemed remorseful for her actions. I can't let this go. I love him and this would never come to us splitting but how do I cope with him continuing to have a relationship with her.

1,1gitzzr,AITA for refusing to refund a friend for a used MacBook I sold to him?,"A few months ago, a good friend of mine wanted to buy my MacBook M1 2020. I asked him what he was willing to offer, and he said €500 but requested a test period. I agreed to let him test it out.

After about three weeks without hearing from him, I reached out to see how things were going. He said he was satisfied but had noticed some slight visual damage on the corner of the laptop and mentioned that there was no charger included. Because of these issues, he asked if I would accept €400 instead. I felt that €500 was already below market price, so I countered with €450, and he agreed.

Now, months later, he contacted me saying that a line has appeared on the screen, which is getting darker over time. He believes it might be related to the screen itself or its connection. He mentioned that he's always kept the laptop in a hard case and stored it carefully. He also noted that the screen seems a bit loose.

He's asking if he can return the laptop and get a full refund because the repair costs are higher than what he originally paid.

I sold the laptop to him in good faith, and it was functioning properly during the test period and at the time of sale.

2,1gitw8o,WIBTA for telling my mom she held to what my dad does?,"My mom married a guy who was not meant to be a parent, and yes, he’s my biological dad. I have two sisters, but I’m more “emotional” than them. He’s called me stupid, fat, and dumb, and said I would live on the streets if I didn’t do better. He’s been like this my whole life. Recently, he’s even told me men are meant to raise men and women are meant to raise women. He also said that if he had sons, then he wouldn’t let them be around their mother as much. 

He said that we would be more into sports if we were boys, and because we are girls, we didn’t, which is odd because my mom, who is his wife, played more sports than he did. He says he does and says the things he’s been this way my whole life, but honestly, I don’t think my mom wants to really recognize it. She knows the way he acts is wrong; she’s privately said he was an asshole and narcissistic. 

I even know many people told her to divorce him because of a situation, but she had kids and didn’t want to struggle. One thing that is her biggest flaw is she does nothing because she’s non-confrontational. She’s seen and heard him say many things to us, and me and my sisters argue back defending ourselves. She’s told us to not argue with him, so we should know who he is by now.

 I judge my parents on many things they do because of the issues I was put in by my parents. My dad can’t wait until I have my own kids because “parenting didn’t come with a book.” I think that my mom should know what her husband does, if she doesn’t speak out for herself, then she’s held to her husband’s words and she’s associated with her husband. I tell her you marry a man like this, and you wonder why we’re crying and why we’re arguing. 

When married, you become aligned with that person, and when you see that person do wrong, you just don’t sit there and not say anything. Shouldn’t you make your position clear? It’s either back them up or disagree when it’s clear they’re in the wrong, whether that be in front of them or privately. I just feel like it’s kind of like the bystander effect.

My mother isn’t submissive at all; she would stand up for herself and have her voice heard. I’ve seen her do it, even against my dad, but for some reason, she doesn’t with us. When it comes to him. I hate when my dad decides to touch her breast and makes comments on her body in front of me I hate they still try to have sex because I wonder why would you want to love and have sex with a man like that. Knowing that he does act the way he does towards your kids. Whenever I say this and voice myself she says that's not true because me and him are different people. She doesn’t see that she’s wrong because she hasn’t taken part in his behavior. Am I crazy to think that when it comes to marriage, you’re held liable to each other, or am I wrong to tell my mom that she’s held to what my dad does?

After MIL and SILs made the offer Danni approached me and accused me of acting like I'm a daughter to the family and not a daughter in-law like her and the rest of the ILs.

4,1gis3zp,AITA for telling my husband I’m doing trying to help him lose weight,"Edit: “done trying to help him,” not “doing trying to help him”

My (F31) husband (M34) have been together for 7 years, married 2. Lately, he has expressed disappointment in his weight gain and appearance. He’s never been athletic or a big exerciser, but was always slender and lean. Maybe it’s genes or age catching up to him, but he’s gained about 30 lbs over 2 years, and his physical shows he has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and vitamin D deficiency. His family also has a history of diabetes and heart disease, which he has been very concerned about since his physical. All these factors brought him to the decision that he needs to lose some weight and get a little more active.

A few years ago I dropped 25 lbs and have kept it off. When I saw him struggling to stick to a diet, I offered to develop him a meal program and help him see it through. He’s been diagnosed with ADHD and often struggles with planning and impulse control. He seemed excited for the help, but said he felt a little bad having me do extra work. I told him I’d love to help and I got right to work.

I calculated his TDEE and built a whole meal plan around his calorie goal to lose 1-2 lbs per week. Every weekend for a month, I cooked, packed, and labeled every meal for him. It was a large variety of dishes to keep it interesting and delicious. Every day before work, I’d pack him breakfast, lunch, and a snack. Dinner was also a meal prep when he got home. I explained to him that if he sticks to what I’ve made, he will stay within his calorie allowance and see results.

Inexplicably, every week at his weigh in, his weight went up 1-2 lbs. We moved his weigh ins from Mondays to Fridays. I recalculated his TDEE. I reassessed my calorie calculation on my recipes. He wasn’t weight lifting. He promised he was sticking to the meal preps. It didn’t make sense why he’d be gaining weight.

This morning, I reworded my questions a little. I asked him if he was eating anything at work besides the meal preps. He told me after he finishes his meal preps, he’ll go to a restaurant near work and get another meal during lunch. He keeps a bag of candy in his desk eat throughout the day. At night after I’ve gone to bed, he’ll eat 2-3 meal preps or make a sandwich with a bowl of cereal. By my calculations, he was eating more than twice his max calorie range.

He told me he thought when I said “sticking to the meal preps” that meant eating the entirety of the meal preps and then it wouldn’t matter what additional stuff he ate, he’d still lose weight. I was frustrated, but I calmly told him there’s no way he could have thought that’s what I meant. I told him I’m sympathetic to his ADHD and how it might make this journey difficult, but if it’s something he wants, he needs to try. He told me no one asked me to help him, so I told him “that’s fair. I’m done trying to help you with this.” And things have been weird between us since.

5,1girw2k,AITA For Telling My Boyfriend I Can't Be Around His Mom For The Time Being?,"Hi reddit! First Time writer here so please excuse any mistakes.

Me (22F) and my boyfriend--we can call him Colton--(23M) have been dating for almost four years now. We met in college and instantly clicked.

By now we've met each others families and built relationships with them. Colton went camping with me last year--my family LOVES to camp and normally it included several aunts and uncles along with a bunch of little cousins running around--and my entire family loved him.

I've met his family a handful of times, he's been honest with me in admitting he isn't very close with his parents. He's the middle child in a family of seven and he just felt neglected growing up and like he was an afterthought. While he's still close with his siblings, all of whom I adore, he's never grown out of feeling like his parents don't care about him.

His mom invited us over for dinner about a week ago. It was going smoothly and I was doing most of the talking, something Colton prefers because he tries to minimize interactions. If he talks about work or friends I've noticed his parents tend to act disinterested or sometimes even critical for no reason at all. Anyways, his mom asked what I was doing this upcoming weekend and I was honest saying I'm driving home because it's the anniversary of my sister passing away and I always spend that time with my family. His mom knows that I lost my sister, it was not new information. It came up when we first met because she kept asking about family and I couldn't avoid telling her. The conversation slowly withered out then, but now she asked questions on top of questions that made me uncomfortable. I finally said that I didn't want to talk about this right now and apologized, saying the topic made me sad.

She had the audacity to scoff and said something that made my heart stop. She said ""So you're willing to just let your sisters memory fade away? Pardon me for wanting to keep her alive by talking about her.""

Colton got pissed. He helped me out of my seat and he walked me to our car before going back inside and grabbing our things. I cried the entire way home.

She invited us over again for dinner in two weeks to ""make things right"". Colton thinks we should go but I'm really afraid I'll have a meltdown if I see her that soon. He's a little upset because she's blowing up his phone about it and this is what he's always trying to avoid. Apparently she also told his siblings what happened, because Colton's sister who is one of my good friends called me saying that I'm being unkind by not giving her a chance to apologize.

I really don't want to talk to her right now. I'm not saying forever, just not right now. I've told my friends and half of them are torn because I'll have to see her again eventually, and waiting it out might make it harder. I don't even know what I'd say.

6,1girnv9,AITA for telling my best friend that I am pregnant? ,"I (33f) have been in a very close friendship with N (31f) for about 8 years. We have been through a lot of things together and for the last year and a half I’ve been on her side for her infertility journey. She has been through 2 inseminations and 2 rounds of IVF, all to no avail. She has PCOS and she doesn’t ovulate naturally. We started with our partners at around the same time, and in the past I told her that I would start trying for a baby at the end of last summer. I asked her if I got pregnant, if she wanted to know, and she said that I could tell her. 

A couple of months ago her 2nd round of IVF failed and she was obviously devastated. She told me that she didn’t want to talk about pregnancies when we met, and we didn’t. In that time I knew I was pregnant, but didn’t say. 

Two weeks later she called me and told me doctors had found a possible cause of why IVF wasn’t working, and she was under an infection treatment and would try again in a month. I was very excited for her. And we set a date to meet in around 10 days. As she was the one to start talking about the topic again, I decided I would tell her I am pregnant, cause I was already 10 weeks and was going to announce it soon publicly and I’d rather she knew by me. So when we met, we talked about her a little, and then I told her. Her reaction was cold and she just said: “oh, congratulations, then”. And then she said: “that was fast, huh?”. I was kinda taken aback but gave her grace because of her situation, I just had expected she could be happy for me, but it was okay, so I gave her time and space and didn’t talk for a month. 

A month later, I asked about an exam she had at work, and she answered with a 4 minute long audio telling me she was offended that I had told her about my pregnancy when she specifically asked not to talk about that topic. And that she didn’t want to know from me or see me again for a while. I was really taken aback and told her she was the first one to talk about the topic again and thought she was optimistic with the new discoveries and treatment so she would be happy for me, and I was hurt about her deciding when or how we can be friends. 

This was a month ago and we haven’t spoken since then, I think about her sometimes and worry about her, but on the other hand I am hurt that she doesn’t want to be my side or my baby’s and if she does come back, I don’t know if that’d be a healthy friendship. 

So, AITA? 

EDIT:
INFO: We didn't meet TO talk about her new treatment, the meetup was set beforehand because we were in summer holidays and couldn't meet before. When we meet we usually talk about everything and anything.

At that time she was NOT in an IVF treatment. The new discoveries were that they found an infection in her uterus that may be causing her embryos not sticking, and she was treating that. No hormones, just antibiotic and she was responding well and would go another round of IVF soon, with a lot more chances. It was a major change in the game, but she was impatient, which is understandable. 

HOW I TOLD HER: We were talking about life in general, first about her, not the uterus or anything, just updates in her life. She asked how about you, what's new? And I said ""I have to tell you something"" and she said: ""You're pregnant"". Obviously she might have remember I told her I would have already started by then, and I said ""yes"". Then she said ""that was fast"". And ONLY talked abut my pregnancy WHEN she asked some questions. After that we changed the topic and SHE talked about her advances with antibiotics and she told me she was considering surrogacy and as always, I listened to her and was there for her. I never again talked about my pregnancy nor did I send her any picture of my ultrasounds, and gave her space.

And she didn't communicate she preferred I announced via text. She doesn't know about reddit, as we are Spanish and it's not common here and she doesn't understand English. We always talk about big things in person and in private, so that's why I did it like that, and how we had discussed it.

We have been through a lot of things together and for the last year and a half I’ve been on her side for her infertility journey. She has been through 2 inseminations and 2 rounds of IVF, all to no avail. She has PCOS and she doesn’t ovulate naturally. We started with our partners at around the same time, and in the past I told her that I would start trying for a baby at the end of last summer. I asked her if I got pregnant, if she wanted to know, and she said that I could tell her. 

A couple of months ago her 2nd round of IVF failed and she was obviously devastated. She told me that she didn’t want to talk about pregnancies when we met, and we didn’t. In that time I knew I was pregnant, but didn’t say. 

Two weeks later she called me and told me doctors had found a possible cause of why IVF wasn’t working, and she was under an infection treatment and would try again in a month. I was very excited for her. And we set a date to meet in around 10 days. As she was the one to start talking about the topic again, I decided I would tell her I am pregnant, cause I was already 10 weeks and was going to announce it soon publicly and I’d rather she knew by me.

11,1gipsm2,AITA for making plans to go to my grandparents house for the holidays instead of going home to dad's?,"I (18f) started college a few months ago and I moved out of my dad's house over the summer. Dad assumed that for the holidays and summer I would come back home to stay with him, his wife and my stepsister (7f). But after thinking it over since September I decided to speak to my grandparents, my dad's parents, and asked if I could spend the holidays with them and they said yes. My dad's upset about this and so is my stepsister. My dad's wife is plain old pissed at me though.

I have a reason I decided this. I was 14 when my dad and his wife got married and we moved in together 2 months before the wedding. At that point my stepsister was 3 and we had to share a bedroom until I moved out. If I go back to dad's place I'll be forced to share a room with her again and I don't want that. I resented it when I still lived there and it made things awkward. Since they don't have another room that could double as a bedroom I'd only have that option if I stayed there.

Last week my dad mentioned me coming home again and I told him what I'd decided to do instead. He was like why would you do that, this is your home and I told him I'd be more comfortable at my grandparents since there's more space for me and a room to myself. He told me my room was still there for me too and I told him a room that I would be sharing with a young kid. My dad's wife was in the background and could hear what we were saying and when dad and I finished talking she called me up and she told me the fact I said a really young kid and not my sister spoke about what this was really about and she told me I couldn't make it any clearer that I want to avoid her daughter and then she told me her daughter would be so upset.

A couple of days ago then my dad put my stepsister on the phone and she was asking if I was really not coming to stay and she started to cry and said she'd missed me and wanted to sleep in the room with me again. I told her I was sorry but that couldn't happen. My dad's wife tried to get my grandparents to agree to let my stepsister stay some nights I was there but they said no.

I (25 F) was driving with my boyfriend Adrian of 5 years (25 M) to pick up some snacks for a watch party. When we got out of the grocery store it was sprinkling very lightly, but noticeably. I started up the car, then turned the windshield wipers on. Adrian in the passenger seat immediately told me to turn it off, since it would damage the car if windshield wipers were used on dry glass. I pointed out the droplets, then also mentioned how uncomfortable I was with stuff on the glass (I was in a life-threatening car accident when it was sprinkling, which he knew about). He ignored me and repeated that this could damage the car and continued to insist I turn them off. I refused. He tried to convince me that it wasn’t raining when there was noticeable rain.

Later that night we got into an argument over the issue. He still thinks he “was right” and is rephrasing it to sound like “it wasn’t raining”, then when I insisted, changed his phrasing to “intermittent rain”, and said I had “developed a bad habit of leaving them on when wasn’t raining”.

I can’t believe he blindsiding the sprinkling, but most of all, I can’t believe he was choosing to be nitpicky over the windshield wipers and never addressed my personal discomfort. At night I called him immature and not ready for a relationship. 

However, a part of me wonders if I did the wrong thing with the windshield wipers by turning them on (lowest setting) when it was only raining lightly. Was I being the immature one?

I (25 F) was driving with my boyfriend Adrian of 5 years (25 M) to pick up some snacks for a watch party. When we got out of the grocery store it was sprinkling very lightly, but noticeably. I started up the car, then turned the windshield wipers on. Adrian in the passenger seat immediately told me to turn it off, since it would damage the car if windshield wipers were used on dry glass.

14,1giowlx,AITA (35M) for leaving my partner (25F) alone on a work trip for a night?,"I'm on a work trip and invited my GF of 6 months. Prior to this trip I told her that there would likely be a night where I couldn't spend a lot of time with her because of a dinner and going out after. I told her if there were other couples she could come join after dinner or I would just come back and meet up with her and we could go out separately. I didn't think it was appropriate for her to meet my colleagues if no other couples were there. 

She is independent and said she would be fine. 

Since she arrived she's been acting weird and making cutting remarks towards me. I asked her what was wrong yesterday a couple of times and she said it was ""suspect that I kept asking her"" - indicating to her than I had done something wrong. 

Later she admitted she was upset with me but ""didn't want it to interfere with my work day and wasn't ready to talk about it"". 

I told her I didn't appreciate her being cold and gaslighting me and that we could talk the next day. I went out for my work dinner, got a bit too drunk and my phone died. I got back to our hotel at midnight and she was crying, we fought more - she made it clear she was upset because she felt hidden from my work colleagues - and she slept on the couch. 

Am I the asshole for abandoning her in a foreign city after feeling she was being manipulating?

TLDR: I (35M) left my GF (25F) on her own in a foreign city after a day of fighting and feeling mistreated - AITA??

Let's get to It, during the last session we encountered a dude with his cart broken, we help him and the merchant of the group reveals him that we have this crazy valuable thing (Giant's teeth) with us, we're far from Modena still but he decides to make a deal with the guy for money. None of our checks made us realize he was lying on the broken cart but I still think It wasn't a good movee, character wise, to tell him about the teeth. This character, Lorenzo, despite being 18, Is not that naive, he fabbricated a huge lie on the spot when an inquisitor saw us steal books from the house of a excommunicated man so I can't see him being this naive.

Anyways, this made that the guy and his crew of highly trained thieves found us during the night (while half of the group was out... Having fun with ladies, including me since I have the lustful trait) and ended up killing 1 possibly 2 of our group.
This wrecked me cause the 1 that surely died Is a character that my pg had been caring for, he had contracted cholera after fighting the giant and he was the only one that my medic had treated carefully and sweetly, he cut his hair when he asked him to and was teaching him how to write so he could write to his dad, he promised him he would have been ok previously.

After the game we (Escluding the merchant player cause he had to go home with his GF) went to get poke and I said that I didn't like his play while my sister kept bugging the dm saying to reroll the dice or that since the difficulty was 14 and he did 15 he could close an eye for that. We were all bummed out, I also said that my character will now not want to continue the journey with the merchant and I got told that I can't force the merchant's player to change pg, I said that It wasn't what I was trying to do and I just thought that my pg would feel like that, but then I let it go and didnt bring it up again.

On the car ride home my sister went on a bit on how she thinks the DM was unfair and gave us an encounter too undefeatable for us, so I said my opinion about the merchant player again and she raised her voice saying that I can't force him to change pg (again), I was frustrated at that point cause I'm autistic and It felt like all night long I was having my words misunderstood or having the wrong reaction, so the frustration was hearable In my voice when I answered ""I don't want that can you all please stop saying I want that?"" And she got mad, after a few minutes of silence she said ""Now don't be mad at ME for saying that"" and I just couldn't hold It and started crying saying that I never mean anything I dont say and if I feel something I say that and that there's nothing between the lines, the rest of the car ride was silent.

17,1gilznc,AITA for not smiling at my mom after she left with my siblings,"To start things off, I don't really know what's going on with my parents. Ever since I was a kid my mom would always suddenly try to leave our house and shit but this time is the first time she succeeded.

So a few days ago, I was watching a movie, and my mom started packing up things and I asked her where she was going. She told me to come with her for 2 days and that it's going to be a vacation but when I asked her where she didn't tell me. I've known her for so long that I knew she was leaving because of problems involving my dad.

I said no though. Both my siblings were going and I didn't wanna leave my dad because I didn't want him to be lonely. I also didn't want to be seen as if I picked sides so I just tried to keep away from it. 

My dad came home and found out everyone was gone. I thought he would have lashed out but he just looked sad with the groceries he bought for my siblings. He left some time after to look for them. He called me a few times asking me if I knew where my mom was and telling me to text her to ask where she was. He sounded so disappointed when he asked me why I didn't know where she was. It stung lol.

My dad came home. I heard him calling with my mom. Judging from what I heard, my dad was able to talk to her while he was searching for them and that they'd come home the next day.

They did come home and she was smiling and told me I should have come. I don't remember what I said but it was along the lines of I have stuff to do which was actually true.

After that, my mom kept trying to get close with me, constantly kissing me. It was the type of kisses that were disgusting and felt like they left saliva. I've always told her that I was uncomfortable with it but she never listens. I avoided her a few times after that, by leaving after 5 to 7 minutes that she was there because she kept trying to do that. It was never this bad before. She keeps asking me if I have a problem with her in an angry voice that I really dislike. I'm not sure what to do. 

I haven't been smiling at her these past couple days since I kept staying in my room reading. She would knock on my door asking to see me. I always answered but would never prolong it. She asked me if I wanted to make pizza a while ago. I didn't really answer and just followed her since I was feeling so tired. She asked me if I had a problem with her again while I was eating. I said no and that I was just tired.

I bumped into my dad. He actually noticed that I looked tired lol. Or maybe it was because I accidentally slept on the table lmao. I honestly don't know what to do with my mom. I don't really wanna talk to her because she's try to kiss me again and it's so gross but she just keeps pushing my boundaries but at the same time I don't really like frequently getting asked ""do you have a problem with me?"" since it's honestly very uncomfortable.

That got him a little riled up. I went back to playing on my PS5 which he then proceeded to unplug. I told him to give it to me, which he did.

23,1giinww,AITAH for telling my husband to sleep in another room?,"I am new to posting here so bear with me. This may seem like a small issue but it is somewhat tearing us apart.

A little background. I have a chronic illness that requires me to sleep and be rested. I also suffer with mental health issues and I have dyslexia (this is important for later). 
 My husband is on the autistic spectrum. We have been together 13 years married for 5.

For the past week I have had a cold/sinusitis thanks to part of my condition. We have both been going through some stress with husbands work place. I practically became a part time lawyer because he simply could not face it, or understand the wordy legal documents.

Because of this he has become sensitive to my snoring. Either that or I have been snoring more because of everything mentioned above. I'm not sure which, possibly a bit of both.

Any way the past couple of nights he has been having issues falling asleep because of my snoring. He gets annoyed and either nudges me or shouts. This leads to me being woken. He continues to say I'm the reason I cannot sleep and I need to do something about it. I explain that I don't know I'm doing it because I'm asleep and I have no control. I tell him to go in the other room if its that much of a problem. He says ""why should I?"" and I respond with you are the one with the problem. He's counter argument, you're the reason. 

This leads to us both being mad at each other and my condition worsening. 

I the morning he apologises and it's like it never happens... Until the night time when it happens again. 

I am considering setting up the other room as my bedroom. But we would loose some space. 

So my question here is... AITAH for telling my husband to sleep in the other room? 

Thanks for reading! 

Edit: I feel that people were too quick to judge me as TAH here. I don't have any idea I'm snoring or to the extent. It is also my partner that is then waking me negatively to get me to stop instead of just removing himself.

I have health conditions that mean I need rest.

I spoke with him yesterday and we are turning our second bedroom into my bedroom/office as I work from home (and now the sole money maker) I have ordered a bed to be delivered and new bedding. So the setup will be done in a week or 2.

He actually asked if I was sure I wanted to be the one to move. I explained that the bedroom/office is brighter in the mornings (he's sensitive to light) and doesn't have a door (both room and hallway too small for one). So due to his light and noise sensitivities I am being the one to move.

Just another FYI to those in the comments saying that I he should not have to move but me... He misses me and will likely struggle to sleep without me. It's a comfort thing.

24,1giih1c,AITA for going on holiday without my partner?,"My girlfriend and I had been planning a holiday for next year. We live in the UK, and we'd chosen a European city we’ve always wanted to visit, aiming to go in March. We priced everything up and agreed we’d book it after Christmas.

Then, last week, my girlfriend saw the lineup for a festival she’s wanted to go to for ages. It’s in July, and tickets are over £250. She asked if I’d like to go, but I told her festivals aren’t really my thing and the music isn’t what I enjoy.

She’s been trying to get me to change my mind, but I said I’d rather not spend that much on something I won’t enjoy and suggested she ask a friend to go instead.

After that, she suddenly told me she doesn’t think she can afford the holiday anymore. I asked why, and she just repeated that she can’t manage it, so we won’t be going away.

Then she brought up the festival again, and I pointed out that it seems like she’s cancelling the holiday out of spite because I’m not going to the festival with her. She denied it but started looking up the costs for the festival anyway.

I explained that the festival, travel, and everything else will add up to about the same as our holiday, so it’s obvious she’s just choosing the festival over our plans. I told her I’m still planning to go on the holiday and that she’s welcome to come if she wants.

She got annoyed, saying it’s unfair for me to still go and that I should be considering the festival instead. But I reminded her that I’ve made it clear from the start that the festival isn’t something I’m interested in.

I said it feels unreasonable for her to cancel our holiday just because I’m not keen on the festival, and I’m not missing out on a trip just because she wants to go. She said I’m being harsh and unfair for going ahead with our original plans solo, but I reminded her again—she’s totally welcome to come; she’s just choosing not to.

Generally, they’re great tenants—rent is always on time, and they’re easy to live with. However, she’s a shopaholic, constantly ordering packages. I don’t mind occasional deliveries, but the sheer volume has become overwhelming.
I frequently order from Amazon and other sites.  I have deliveries sent to my garage and notifications set up.  I also work from home so I can retrieve packages quickly if drivers miss instructions. So far, no issues and I’ve never had any porch pirates.
When the tenants moved in, they went on an extended overseas vacation, saying they’d have “a few packages” shipped back. I agreed, but soon became inundated with over 20 large boxes, some weighing 30-40 pounds. I schlepped them to my garage until they returned. I brushed it off, thinking it was a one-time thing. Then they went on a two-week cruise, and more packages arrived.
Since then, deliveries haven’t slowed down. I asked them to set up delivery instructions to the garage and notifications, the same as I did. I made it clear that I don’t want my porch to become a target for thieves, especially since my house faces the main road. Despite this, packages were still left on my porch.
Again, I spoke to her, and suggested she rent a mailbox at a nearby postal store, but she said it was too expensive and inconvenient with her schedule. Amazon Lockers don’t work since she orders from other sites. She did agree to have packages sent to her sister’s during vacations, but this doesn’t address the daily issue.
Packages keep coming to my porch, so I must move them to the garage and text them each time, sometimes 3 or 4 times a day. It’s become a huge PITA, as I have a ruptured disk in my back, which she is aware. I've nearly tripped over boxes just opening the door to leave the house. Two weeks ago, there were two huge boxes taking up my whole porch.  I swear, I’ve had to fight the urge to NOT punt the damn things off the porch and I don’t want to bust my foot LOL.
I’m usually easygoing, but I’m fed up with being the “middle man” for her “shopping sprees,” as she jokes and I feel it is very inconsiderate. I don’t want to seem like a nitpicky, b*tch, especially since I already had to address parking issues when they first moved in.
I made it clear when I interviewed them that we’d need to respect each other’s space due to our unique shared living circumstances, yet they seem oblivious.
They’re on a month-to-month lease, and I’m considering raising the rent for the extra hassle or banning deliveries entirely.

My brother has recently started seeing this girl (let's call her Jenny) started having her spend the night every night for the past few weeks. We discussed with my brother when he moved in that he would need to limit having anyone spend the night to 3 nights maximum weekly just to avoid someone slowly moved in and/or still allow us to enjoy our house amongst just us. This was never an issue with his last girlfriend but he seemed to have forgotten with the new girl.

Eventually my husband and I had to call him on it and told him he needed to limit how often Jenny spends the night. His response was ""You won't need to worry about it much longer as I'll be moving out soon"" and we left it at that. He then ignored us both entirely for 2 1/2 weeks causing things to be awkward and uncomfortable and my husband called him out which caused a huge argument as he feels he should be exempt from this rule we've had with other roommates, resulting in me giving him a 30 day notice ending on November 26th. He's now refusing to pay any rent for November and as we have no contractual agreement I'm ready to have the authorities involved with a report of him trespassing if possible tomorrow.

For reference we're in LA and we only charge him $750 all-inclusive for rent including a bi-weekly maid service. AITA for moving forward with this while feeling like he's taking advantage of and being unreasonable with a good living situation we're extending to him?

Savannah still won’t open up even when I’ve tried everything to connect with her.

Basically, it’s always like this:

I invited her to do something that I know she’d like. She’d rather stay home. 

I got her a gift, she doesn’t want it. Throws it away right in front of us sometimes.

I sent her a funny video, she’s flipping shit with her Mom (‘Jane’) because she thinks the video is about her and accuses me of making fun of her.

Basically, Savannah’s made it clear for 2 years now that she wants nothing to do with me. So I’ve given up and just stay away from her ATP.

My younger stepsibs did want to have a bond, so we spend a lot of time together. Last straw with Savannah was when I invited them to have a sibling day with friends. Savannah said she didn’t want her bio sibs to go. Stepsibs wanted to go and parents approved, so we went.

Savannah told me off when I got home because they’re her bio sibs and not mine. I’m so fucking fed up with her at this point.

But the world doesn’t revolve around you and people are allowed to move on and be happy even if you decide you want to be miserable all the time.

Dad asked me if something was up because Savannah was obviously pissed and causing issues for everyone later. Which is when I explained what happened. Dad basically said he knows we’re frustrated with Savannah but my delivery was mean.

I think Dad’s being too sensitive and coddling Savannah because even Jane is on my side. Savannah has a therapist but never listens to them and it’s been years.

34,1gig4y6,AITA for comparing a turtle to an actual child? ,"A few months ago I visited my friend's house and noticed her sister has a turtle in a tank that seems way too small, and the water was mostly dirty. I suggested that the turtle needs a bigger tank and cleaner water. My friend dismissed my concerns, saying it’s her sister’s responsibility since it’s her pet.

The issue is, her sister goes to their brother’s house for 3-4 days at a time, so today while my visit I asked who feeds the turtle when she’s gone. My friend said no one, I asked when was the last time anyone fed the turtle and my friend didn’t know and said she didn’t feel responsible for feeding it because she has no attachment to the turtle, not her responsibility. I understand that my friend doesn’t own the turtle and shouldn’t be fully responsible for its care, but I was concerned about how heartless it seemed to ignore a living creature’s needs, especially when the food is right next to the tank. It would take five seconds, max, to feed that poor turtle.

I tried to make the point that just because she isn’t the owner doesn’t mean she can’t help care for it considering her sister clearly does not take care of it . I compared the situation to being at a mall and seeing a lost child in a wheelchair asking for help to find security since they can’t do it on their own. I asked my friend if she would ignore the child as well since it’s not her responsibility aka mot attachment. My friend got upset and found this comparison weird and thought it was wrong to equate a turtle to a human child.. I argued that ignoring the child because they aren’t yours would be heartless, just like ignoring the needs of the turtle. I emphasized that both animals and people rely on others for help, especially when they’re in vulnerable situations.

I ended up feeding the turtle since the food was right next to the tank, and he started eating immediately, indicating he was probably hungry.

37,1gifyji,AITA for moving on from my ex gf and going to a football game with a girl and some other friends?,"AITA for going to a football game with another girl after my ex and I broke up?

Backstory:
My girlfriend’s mom scheduled a belly piercing for her at 4 p.m. on homecoming day, fully knowing my mom had set up professional photos for us at 5:30. Her mom had even asked me weeks before when homecoming was, so she knew it’d interfere. I told her mom we wouldn’t have time for her to take pictures, but she was welcome to join the pro shoot, and she said, “No, it’s okay, you guys go take pictures.”

We go, take pictures, and go out to eat. While we’re eating, her mom blows up her phone, saying we “kicked her to the curb” and calling us “manipulative and controlling.”

The Relationship Fallout:
Two weeks before, we had a huge fight that nearly ended us because she’d been blowing up on me daily. She got upset I didn’t say “I love you” and “bye” properly at my swim meet, then sent me seven minutes of voice memos crying about it. I’d already apologized, but I finally told her I was done with the gaslighting and manipulation. After we cooled off, we made up and agreed to go to homecoming together. Her mom, however, had always been controlling. Last year, she wouldn’t let my mom choose where to take pictures and didn’t even let her take any herself.

After homecoming, her mom threw around words like “emotionally abusive” and said if my girlfriend didn’t break up with me, she’d lose her truck, phone, college fund, and a Europe trip. She even said that if my girlfriend married me after college, she’d cut her out of her life. My girlfriend and I decided to secretly date, but later that night, she told me she wanted to be just friends. A few days later, she told me there was “no future” for us and completely crushed any hope of us getting back together.

I cried for weeks but eventually moved on.

The Football Game:
A couple of weeks later, I went to a football game to support my coworker and church friend. My tire blew out, and all my bros and family were busy, so I asked a girl who likes me (and who my ex knew about) for a ride. My ex’s friend saw us and sent her pictures.

Then, my ex sent me a long, angry paragraph. She said, “Just so you know, I know. The bisexual freak you ‘hated’ attention from, the one you had ‘no interest in’ because she was ‘weird and ugly’… yeah, I found out. My friend told me everything, and she sent me pictures of her getting out of your car. You never loved me. I thought your love was real, but I guess it was all a lie. I defended you every time my mom said you didn’t really love me, that you just used me and were a liar. Well, I guess she was right. I wish I could take back every fucking tear I shed over someone as dirty and pathetic as you. Fuck yourself, you lying piece of shit. But hey, like Billie Eilish said, you give the ugly guy a chance, and he thinks he rules the world. I’m glad you finally found someone in your league.”

AITA?
I didn’t go to the game to make her jealous or hurt her. I just needed a ride, and this girl happened to be available.

She got upset I didn’t say “I love you” and “bye” properly at my swim meet, then sent me seven minutes of voice memos crying about it. I’d already apologized, but I finally told her I was done with the gaslighting and manipulation. After we cooled off, we made up and agreed to go to homecoming together. Her mom, however, had always been controlling. Last year, she wouldn’t let my mom choose where to take pictures and didn’t even let her take any herself.

After homecoming, her mom threw around words like “emotionally abusive” and said if my girlfriend didn’t break up with me, she’d lose her truck, phone, college fund, and a Europe trip. She even said that if my girlfriend married me after college, she’d cut her out of her life. My girlfriend and I decided to secretly date, but later that night, she told me she wanted to be just friends. A few days later, she told me there was “no future” for us and completely crushed any hope of us getting back together.

I cried for weeks but eventually moved on.

The Football Game:
A couple of weeks later, I went to a football game to support my coworker and church friend. My tire blew out, and all my bros and family were busy, so I asked a girl who likes me (and who my ex knew about) for a ride. My ex’s friend saw us and sent her pictures.

Then, my ex sent me a long, angry paragraph. She said, “Just so you know, I know. The bisexual freak you ‘hated’ attention from, the one you had ‘no interest in’ because she was ‘weird and ugly’… yeah, I found out. My friend told me everything, and she sent me pictures of her getting out of your car. You never loved me. I thought your love was real, but I guess it was all a lie. I defended you every time my mom said you didn’t really love me, that you just used me and were a liar. Well, I guess she was right. I wish I could take back every fucking tear I shed over someone as dirty and pathetic as you. Fuck yourself, you lying piece of shit. But hey, like Billie Eilish said, you give the ugly guy a chance, and he thinks he rules the world. I’m glad you finally found someone in your league.”

AITA?
I didn’t go to the game to make her jealous or hurt her. I just needed a ride, and this girl happened to be available. ",0.0,0.061234556,0,1
38,1giftvd,AITA for wearing my friends sweater?,So I (20F) last night went to a football game with a group of friends and my girlfriend (19F) it was extremely cold and I did both dress warm enough. When we first got there I pointed out that I was cold and one of our friends (18F) who was with us offered me one of her jackets since she had two. I denied it because the one she offered me was a puffer jacket and I don’t really like how they feel. Later in the night however it got way colder and I asked her if I could use the thinner jacket and she gave it to me. This is when my girlfriend became blatantly angry with me. Later I confronted her about it and she said that it hurt I didn’t ask her for her jacket (Even tho our friend had two and my girlfriend only had one). I wasn’t able to fully understand where she was coming from because I consider myself close enough with most of my friends to share clothes with them. We talked about it later but I’m still curious to how others might have handled this situation and when we talked she had some other points about all this but they feel too personal to throw in here so this is just the most tldr I could make the situation. ,Not the A-hole,2024-11-03,AITA for wearing my friends sweater?

40,1gifqu4,AITA for crashing out over Halloween candy? :/,"Hi! I didn't really know how to word the title since I just want to know if I'm being overdramatic or not.

I (F, still a teen) went trick-or-treating for the first time in like 8 years and I got a decent amount of candy. My mom isn't really nice to me and she yelled at me for going out— she doesn't like me hanging out with my friends and expects me to stay in all day, but that's a whole separate issue.

Candy and food in general have always been a sore issue for me since I grew up in a home where my mom refused me any junk food, whether it be candy, chips, or any sort of snack. I used to sneak to the dollar store across the street, buy snacks, and hide them from my mom. My mom also gave me kind of eating issues as she did, and still does, call my stomach big and ugly a lot. This kind of gives context to how I would react later on.

I brought in a bag of candy for me to snack on into school. During chemistry, I left the bag out and went on a walk since the teacher allowed me to do so. When I come back, the bag is 80% gone. Turns out, one of my classmates ate it and she thought it was funny.

For someone who rarely got an opportunity to eat these sweets, I kind of cried and called her a bitch. She kept offering me candy to make it up, but her selfish actions pissed me off.

Anyways, I ended up breaking down. Looking back, it's kind of embarrassing that I sobbed over getting my candy stolen. I wasn't gonna make this post originally, but my mom just stole the rest of my Halloween candy since she says ""I don't need it.""

My crash out might've been building up for a while, since the girl who stole my candy has done other shitty things to me.

41,1gifh9q,AITA For Clapping At Coworker. ,"I (18F) was at work ( cashier) and behind me I had my coworker (16F Bella) another fellow cashier. I had a customer that needed a case of 24 pack of water  bottles scanned. 

In the store we have barcodes of different types of water in a booklet that is clipped together that we scan to avoid having to lift heavy cases of water. 

I didn’t have one on my lane so I turned around and asked Bella if she had the booklet that I could scan. And Bella said “what booklet” I then said “ the water booklet” I need to scan water. She then proceeded to tell me “ which one do you need to scan” there are like “50 different types of water” than I said “ it’s a booklet, then come all clipped together just pass me the whole thing” I proceeded to demonstrate a open and close motion with my hand to demonstrate that it’s a book, and not a singular code. Then she proceeded to yell loudly in-front of customers  with attitude “ don’t clap at me why are you clapping at me” 

I then took her booklet and said in a stern voice I’m “ I’m just asking for the booklet there is no need to be rude cut out the  fucking attitude”. Hours later she eventually came up to me  in-front of other co-workers and “ I don’t appreciate how you spoke to me in-front of the customers when I didn’t know what you you were talking about” 

I than tried to explain that I was not clapping she kept on saying that I was clapping.

46,1gieby9,AITA/ Am i the asshole for declining to go on my boyfriends birthday trip? ,"So let me give a back story. 2 years ago my boyfriend, myself, and our 1 year old son went on a last minute camping trip with all of his buddies. We got a spot right next to the lake with fishing access since they all like to fish. I did not want to go at all because i knew i would get stuck tending to the baby while they drank all night and fished.

 It was freezing cold and our son was super fussy, he really wanted his dad and of course all the guys wanted to go off camp about a mile down the stream to fish. They all told me i should stay with my son and tend to him which i didn't mind but my son wanted only his father at this point. I imagine dad was just warmer. Well i was called a selfish bitch for explainging this, so i went to bed.


 The next morning i'm dying of thirst and hungry, so my boyfriend, his buddie, and i go to the marina for something to drink and socks. I would have been fine drinking whatever we had but they brought beer and thats it. other than my sons milk there was nothing else so i needed something to drink badly. We get in the store and ready to pay, our card declines. all of our money is in savings and we have no service to transfer money over to checking. 


My boyfriend asks his buddie to buy our stuff and he would zelle him as soon as we are out of the mountain. His buddie looks me dead in they eye and says ""i will buy you the socks but i'm not buying her that sprite"" the level of anger i felt and shame i cannot even explain. The socks were 12 bucks my drink was 3 and sure if he didn't have it that would have been fine but he wanted to shame me.


 After that i got home feeling a level of shame i had never felt before. Now heres where it lines up with the current story, my boyfriend took a birthday trip with his buddies this past july, and i didn't go because i was still pissed about that situation. 


He tells me how they got drunk around the fire and talked about it together. Apparently now that the guy has a girlfriend he felt bad for what he did to me.

52,1gic9ad,"AITA for insulting my ""friend"" after she posted a video of me without my consent?","I (28 F) recently went on a trip to New Zealand with a few of my friends. We had a wonderful time until the second to last day there. We had decided to go to an all-you can eat buffet, and later go to the spa. A couple of my friends took forever to wake up so we had to go to the buffet later than I had wanted to. Because of their laziness, I was absolutely starving by the time we got to the buffet. They had so many delicious foods. Prawns, salmon, lamb, beef, but best of all was the chicken curry. It was just so good I couldn't help myself from eating bowl after bowl. It was just so addicting I couldn't stop(this is important). We then went to the spa. 

The main event of this spa was basically this giant outdoor mud bath. I wanted to go in first and have my friend take a video of me for my instagram. Obviously, I looked cute and wanted to show off a lil bit and my friends were hyping me up so I gave a lil twerk. The problem is that I could feel my stomach bubbling from all the chili I had eaten. I thought that if I sucked my stomach in while twerking then I could hold in my fart. It was no use. Unfortunately, since the mud is so thick a giant bubble formed. It was super embarrassing and my friends all just laughed at me. I couldn't tell if the people near me noticed, but at least they didn't really say anything to me. It was overall a pretty traumatic experience for me to have my body betray me in that way in public. Everyone thinks it's just funny and thinks farts are just funny but they all fail to realize that this was a real trauma to me.

I explained how traumatic that slip up was and she said she'd take it down later ""when she had wifi"" or some bs. I told her that if she wasn't such a lazy pig who slept in all day, I wouldn't have been so hungry at the buffet and that wouldn't have happened.

53,1gibfke,WIBTA for charging my roommate and her friends for thr liquor they stole from me?,"Throwaway 

So a bit of information. I was a bartender for 2 years so I know a bit about my liquor and the differences. I moved into a college apartment with my friend I've known for a while, we'll call Q, and another one of my friends while my boyfriend lives with 4 of his friends, one who we'll call P. I love mixing cocktails and shots for friends when they come over or just making a nice little drink for myself when I'm eating dinner, so I splurged a bit when I first moved in and spent around $300 usd on alcohol, (all handles aka 1.75 liters of gin, rum, Malibu, and 4 handles of titos and like 6 bottles of liquor to mix with). I do use these liquors from time to time but I dont go crazy with it. We have another handle of titos which Q had gotten from P's parents (they used to be an item but broke up quite recently and a lot of other drama that is it's whole thing). 

So last night was halloweekend and I live in a college town so of course we're all gonna be partying. I went out to the club with my boyfriend and a couple of my coworkers and before hitting the club, we put some of my liquor into bottles for us to drink when we went back to my coworkers place so I know for certain I had my liquor where it was when we left. 

On the way to the club, P calls my boyfriend telling him they were gonna take 1 bottle of liquor. I said if it's the bottle of Tito's, that's Q's so that's up to her. Night goes by, my boyfriend and I are having a great time at the club then we went back to my coworker's place and played some Mario party. As we're leaving, P calls my boyfriend again and tells him that they took half of my bottles but said they didn't really drink any of it which for me is hard to believe because Q's Tito bottle was very low. I, drunk and having some mental issues, got pissed and was saying ""why didn't you ask me directly if you could have them"" and ""you literally lied to us you said you'd only take one"". My boyfriend and I got back to my apartment around 4 am and all my hard liquor is gone. My gin, my rum, and my Malibu with Q's Tito bottle, leaving just the mixer liquors. I checked Q's location and she got home around the time we did and P told us she had brought the liquor back but it wasn't anywhere to be found. 

Now here comes the question. I left for work today around 6pm today and the liquor still wasnt back so I dont know how much they drank of it. The liquor they took from me would be around $90 usd.  Would I be the asshole if I charged them money for taking the liquor from me? If they simply would have asked me if they could have some, this wouldn't be a big deal because I wouldn't have minded at all. It's the fact that they lied to me and stole it from me without my knowledge. If it seems full, should I take a bit and freeze it to see if there's water? What do I do in this kind of situation?

55,1gia4wj,AITA for throwing my sisters make up and belongings in the trash,"Ok so I (M,16) and my sister (F,20) share a bathroom.  It consists of a toilet and a counter thing with two sinks, we decided that we each would have one side of the counter and keep our stuff in that side. Well she kept trashing both my side and her side with make up and other accessories. 
 to the point that I had no counter space for anything and my sink was full of her stuff. I’ve asked her so many times to please keep her stuff on her side or at least give me a little bit of space and she would for around 2-3 days before it was full of her stuff again. Because there was no clear line I added some black tape down the center of the counter to separate our sides and she still had stuff all over my side. This has been going on for months at this point. Well recently we had l family  coming over and  I wanted to make a good impression as it was their first time at our house. so I asked her if she would clean up her side and she refused.

 to the point that I had no counter space for anything and my sink was full of her stuff. I’ve asked her so many times to please keep her stuff on her side or at least give me a little bit of space and she would for around 2-3 days before it was full of her stuff again.

56,1gj10o1,WIBTA if I asked my friend to use my time zone when scheduling discord hangouts?,"I have a group text with a couple friends. Two of us live in the Midwest one lives on the east coast. We text a fair amount and will have a call on discord every couple months. When scheduling the call I specify the time in Central Time because that's the time zone most of us live in (there's only three of us, so just two to one). My friend on the East Coast always responds in East Coast time.

Part of me is annoyed that I have to figure out what the time would be when he responds '8:00 p.m. my time...' when responding to a time set in central time. (For ex. 'i am free after 7pm central' then '...I'll be done at work at 8 my time...')

I know it's silly, but remembering the time zone difference and then adding the extra hour to my time zone to figure out what time he's actually talking about is a little taxing.

Is this just a majoritarian impulse to crush the minority into making my life more easy?

Eitherway, since I am from the midwest, I'm not sure I would ever actually ask my friend to respond in central time. Maybe that's the real issue, my fear of conflict. Ha uh oh...

(It was in a parking lot; we had our Best Man and MOH as witnesses and my mom and siblings.) It felt more of a vow exchange or a courthouse wedding versus a big wedding. 

Basically, she flipped out on me and the person who told her. She made me cry, and I did raise my voice at her because I wanted her to stop. She wouldn't stop until I told her the very personal reasons we got married legally. She then made a joke about it.

58,1gj0y1k,WIBTA for not texting my mom when I walk to Starbucks in the morning?,"For context, I'm 22M and currently living with my parents. There's a Starbucks right near our house, it's like a 4-6 minute walk depending on traffic. We live outside a small city; not a well-off area, but not particularly bad either.

The past couple days I've been walking there in the morning when they first open (7AM) to get a coffee; I've been telling my mom I'll be doing this the night before since she isn't up that early. Usually in the morning I drink a coffee then immediately take a short nap, because I've found that's the best way to wake myself up.

Yesterday morning, my mom woke up while I was taking said nap, and immediately ran into my bedroom to check if I got home and ask if I was okay. She's now insisting that I need to text her whenever I walk to Starbucks; when I get there, when I leave to go home, and when I get home; so she knows that I got there and back safely and didn't get hit by a car or something. I told her that I felt like that was excessive, and that I felt like it was pointless to text her at all; it takes me 15 minutes to get there and back, and I'm 2 rooms away from her once I get home. She disagreed and told me I couldn't keep walking there unless I did.

For context, I do have ADD, and when I was younger I had a hard time paying attention when crossing the street. I haven't had that problem in years at this point, though, and I literally spend part of my day working in a parking lot now where I've never had an issue.

60,1gj0tlu,"AITA for not remaining in touch with my deceased husband's family, and telling my son that he has a new family now?","I (46F) have a son, Frank (15M) with my late husband, Phil, who passed away from cancer five years ago when Frank was 10. Naturally we were all devastated. About a year after Phil died, I decided I needed a fresh start and moved back to the city where I grew up (which is a 6+ hour drive from where we had been living) to be closer to my family. Not long after that, I met my current husband, Rodrick, and we have two children together. Rodrick and I both come from large families, while Phil's family consists of his parents, brother Steve, sister-in-law Cathy, and nephew Douglas, who is around Frank's age.

I had a good relationship with Phil's family and supported each other after he died. We remained in regular contact when I first moved away, however, after I remarried and had my two younger children, we slowly lost contact. During holidays, Rodrick and I attend various family gatherings, and Frank comes along with us. He says he enjoys spending time with his grandparents and other relatives on my side, but says he feels very bored when we visit Rodrick's family.

Frank remains in regular contact with his paternal grandparents, as well as his aunt, uncle, and cousin Doug. They often video-chat. His grandparents send him gifts for his birthday and Christmas, and he and Doug send each other gifts too. I send them cards and occasionally talk on the phone with Phil's parents, though it's been happening less often. No particular reason, we've just been slowly drifting away as I'm now remarried.

Frank has asked me many times if I can pay to fly him out to where his father's family lives, and I've told him I don't feel comfortable with him traveling by himself while he's a minor. Steve and Cathy feel similarly about having Doug travel by himself and are unable to travel due to their work schedules. Phil's parents aren't comfortable flying due to their age.

Frank has been nagging me to take him to see his father's family for Thanksgiving this year rather than going with me to visit Rodrick's family, saying that in addition to his family, he misses his grandmother's stuffing. I told him that I can't take him, as after all these family gatherings, I am very worn out and am not up for making the drive to where Phil's family lives, but I have the stuffing recipe and if he really wants to, he can make it himself (it’s fairly easy and he enjoys cooking). He continued to nag, and finally I snapped and told him that he has a new father and a new, much larger family and that he needs to try and bond with them. He said that he's trying to do that, but he misses his father's family.

He complained to his grandparents and now they're mad at me, saying that I'm being selfish and I need to let him see them. I told him I can't, but they're welcome to come over here if they want to see him. We had a huge argument and now I'm not on speaking terms with any of them, though Frank remains in regular contact.

My mom said if I did, I was dead to her. I dropped anyway, admitted myself into a hospital, and didn't speak to her for about three years. At the end, I forgave her and we have a civil relationship. But I'm not stupid enough to forget what kind of person would say that kind of thing to anyone in the first place.

The last, she wanted me to go to a church event with her and since they had food, I obliged. At the event, she got into a one-up contest with someone else about their kids accomplishments (and how good their parenting is to have such good kids, ofc). It's embarrassing and I don't enjoy being compared to other people and definitely not in this weird contest. I told my mom this and she scoffed and brushed me off.

Today, she needed help bringing stuff to church so I helped her and drove her there. I stayed to help some more (and food lol.) She got into another brag-off like we didn't just have a conversation about how uncomfortable it makes me. Especially because it just reminds me of the person who put my success over my life.

I kinda blurted out, ""Well, you would make us succeed or die trying. Or, I guess I would've died, right?"" Then, I excused myself and left. 

She's been blowing up my phone because I embarrassed her and this was all supposed to be in the past. My sister thinks that I'm not wrong (that she even wishes she could've been there) but also that it was hurtful our mom. So, aita?

PS- I am still in therapy and I will be talking about this bc I think some old wounds are reopening and I need to address that.

65,1gizhug,AITA for leaving a couple dishes unwashed so I could use the restroom?,"so title is kinda weird but anyways

I’m 17, I work at a country club, this is my second job. We have a clubhouse and a cafe, the cafe is where we do our dishes. I got sent down to the cafe to wash some dishes before whatever event we were catering to ended. I was the only one in the cafe at the time. While I was washing the dishes I had to use the restroom (the number 2). I was gone for like 3 mins and in that timespan my 3 other coworkers came back and one of them started going on a rant saying ‘oh he doesn’t do shit’ because I had left 1 busbin and 1 pan (that we were probably gonna soak anyways) unwashed. Dude was like ‘it should’ve already been done’ but they sent me down 10 mins before they came and they gave me a shit ton of dishes to do.

Everything else was clean and put away, except for say a couple plates I pulled out of the dishwasher before I left. Just the pan and busbin were left. They brought back everything else from the event which was around 5 pans, couple trays, 3ish busbins, etc. 

I’m assuming he was only mad b/c it was gonna ‘take longer’ for everyone to leave but it was 2 fucking dishes. How does that affect anyone at all? 

I walked back in and the one guy told me to go home. Keep in mind he’s not my boss but I didn’t feel like arguing with him.

66,1gizclz,AITA for telling my boyfriend that his parents are taking advantage of us?,"

I (27f) have been dating my boyfriend (30m) for almost 5 years. We were housemates when we started dating and shared a house with others for a year and a half before deciding to move in together alone. Two and a half years ago, my in-laws bought a house and asked if we wanted to live there. After some thought, we accepted. The beginning was stressful because my mother-in-law wanted to be involved in all the preparations, but I told my boyfriend we would handle it ourselves, and she calmed down.

We signed a contract in my boyfriend’s name, with symbolic rent and responsibility for expenses. My boyfriend has a sister who lives abroad with a more stable financial situation, but his parents still give her part of the rent money to maintain “equal rights” between the children. My in-laws own a company, and four months ago, they told us they needed to raise our rent by 85% due to losing an important client. My boyfriend and I discussed it and proposed a 55% increase.
Our contract is valid for 5 years, and by law, landlords can only increase rent once a year by up to 2.16%. Before we reached this agreement, I expressed my concerns to my boyfriend, perhaps a bit aggressively, because it was unfair and not legal. I also suggested that if his parents needed financial help, they should ask him and his sister, given their emphasis on equal treatment. The discussion created tension as it involved his parents. He spoke to them, and they agreed to a 55% increase.
Three months later, I returned from a vacation with friends, and he told me his parents planned to increase the rent next year when we reach three years into the contract, applying it retroactively for the entire period. I was shocked, thinking this issue was resolved, and reminded him that legally they can only apply increases for one year.
We argued again, and I insisted they should follow the law. My boyfriend is too accommodating, and if it weren’t his parents, he wouldn’t accept it. I told him I wouldn’t agree this time, and his parents could only increase the rent for one year.
We haven’t discussed it since, and I doubt he addressed it with his parents. Last weekend, we visited his parents in another city, and I discovered (he already knew) that they were renovating a studio they own with extensive work—a new kitchen, bathroom, essentially everything. I felt they raised our rent to cover these costs.
I can’t look at them the same way and don’t want to be around them. I understand my boyfriend wants to help, but their approach is unfair and unjust to us, especially toward their son. Yet, my boyfriend doesn’t see their behavior as problematic, and it’s affecting our relationship.

68,1giza6m,AITA for not letting family kiss my baby?,"First time asking AITA. Husband and I had our daughter at 6.5 weeks premature, and she spent 12 days in the NICU to grow and feed. We faced lots of backlash-predominantly from my father in law-regarding our “no visitors” policy while she was in the hospital, so far as for him to call me manipulative (behind my back, because he apparently doesn’t have the guts to insult me to my face.) 

Baby is now almost 3 months old, 1 month 2 weeks adjusted, and we have set one rule in place that we don’t think is asking for too much: don’t kiss our baby anywhere. I had hubby relay this to his parents, and I told my family. My family was totally cool about it, and even my nmom said that she’d never dream of kissing a baby when they’re so susceptible to things. I thought his parents would be the same. Wrong! My father in law, and I quote (passed along by my husband, as I was not present for this conversation): “____, that’s sick.” I’m sorry, what? My husband explained that because she’s still such a young baby, and was a premature baby at that, that we want to protect her from germs that are way too big for her tiny body and immature immune system. He then went on to say, “so does that mean that we can’t hug her on her 18th birthday because she was a premature baby?” and then “it’s okay, I know you just have relay the message.” Which seems like he’s insinuating that I created this rule by myself and my husband is just the messenger. 

Like, AITA for not letting these people kiss my baby? I understand that they’re her grandparents and they love her and want to give affection to her, but can’t we do that when she’s not super prone to getting everything under the sun germ wise?

So, I (21M) have been dating my GF (20F) for about a year now. She’s an art major, and honestly, she’s talented. But lately, her art has been taking up a lot of her time. She’s always painting, sketching, or doing some kind of project, even outside her classes. It’s gotten to the point where she’ll spend hours on her stuff and barely pay attention to me or make time to hang out.

I tried talking to her a few times, telling her that I felt like she was spending more time with her “art” than with me, but she’d just brush it off, saying it's important for her career and that art makes her happy. She told me it’s her way of unwinding, and sometimes she’s even working on stuff she hopes to sell in the future.

Anyway, after weeks of her ignoring me for her projects, I got fed up. Last weekend while she was at work, I went over to her place and threw out most of her art supplies — paints, sketchpads, brushes, all of it. I thought maybe if it was gone, she'd finally realize that she was putting too much energy into this hobby and would spend more time with me.

When she came home and realized what I'd done, she freaked out. She was crying and yelling, asking why I’d do something so “cruel.” She even accused me of being controlling and selfish. I told her that I did it because I care about our relationship and felt like she was letting her art come between us. Now she won’t talk to me, and some of her friends are saying I’m a “toxic” boyfriend.

I honestly thought she'd see that I did it because I want us to spend more quality time together, but now I’m questioning if I maybe went a bit too far. AITA?",Asshole,2024-11-03,"AITA for Throwing Away My Girlfriend's Art Supplies Because She Was Spending Too Much Time on Her Hobby?

This happened about an hour ago and I’m still reeling from it and I honestly don’t think I was in the wrong, but maybe I’m the weirdo/asshole

For context, I am a 34f and I live in an apartment/townhome complex. The neighbor in question is also a female but I believe older than me. We had maintenance people going around today replacing air filters. We were not notified that they would be doing this so they were just going around knocking on doors to ask if they could come in and replace it. I happened to be outside smoking when I saw her come out of her apt and go “hello?!” A few times. I assumed they had knocked and she didn’t answer fast enough so they moved on because they were just over there. I decided to walk over and knock to let her know it was them in case she wanted to grab them. Fatal mistake.

To be clear, I have spoken to this neighbor once or twice before. She apparently knows my best friend of 25 years and told me when I was out walking my dog after my friend had stopped by. If I had never spoken to her, I probably wouldn’t have bothered. I went over and knocked on her door then stood back on the side walk.

73,1giyh35,AITA for not being very inviting to my own mom?,"Some backstory- I, 28yo F, live in Western SD. I have lived here for just over 10 years. My husband & I married in 2020. My mom lives in Southeast NE, about an 8 hour drive. We typically only see each other 1-2x/year. I have distanced myself in the last 4 years or so. & by distanced I mean I don't reach out anymore because I felt like I was the only one who ever called her and she seemed uninterested in anything I had to say. She wasn't interested in helping with our wedding decorations the day before and took her other children to lunch while we decorated the venue. I'm her eldest daughter and thought this would be something she'd want to help with. I also asked her if she would do something special for me and pick out my wedding day perfume and surprise me on the big day. I asked her to do this months in advanced of course and she seemed happy to do so. On the day of the wedding she came in and brought a still packaged 3 pack of perfume with the store sticker still on it. She said she hoped had just come from the store and this is what she found. It hurt my feelings.. mom did not understand the assignment. It was meant for her to choose the scent that will always take me back to my wedding day and I had hoped she would have seen that, but anyone could have gone to the store to pick up a multi pack of perfume the morning of my wedding. She also didn't come to photos before the ceremony. We took photos pre ceremony so that we didn't have to spend 2 hours before the reception taking photos and leave our guests waiting. I have 1 photo with my mom from my wedding day. It was behind the venue, with a dumpster in the background and taken on a cell phone. I feel like I need to also say that she was very much in the loop with the schedule and itinerary for the day.
So, this was around the time when I told myself I was living my life for myself and my own family. I knew that when I quit calling our contact would cease altogether and I was right.

This weekend my mom was coming up from NE to SD to attend a cancer benefit event put on by a local tattoo shop in which proceeds went to my aunt (mom's sis) as she is battling cancer. My mom drove up on Fri. The event was all day Saturday. I did not bring my kids because I knew I would be standing in line for a tattoo for hours (and I did- 2 hours) & knew my kids wouldn't stand in that line for that long and I wasn't sure if kids were allowed. I left the event around 3pm and went home. I'm not sure what my mom did with the rest of her day. She did say she was leaving today (Sunday).This isn't the first time that she's come up for a quick trip for something and not reached out or not seen my kids and/or myself. I don't want to force it because I don't want my kids to have any unrealistic expectations of her.

i understand this is a shared fridge, and while i am anal about expiration dates, i checked every single item and went by the written expiration dates. me and the two other roommates had very little expired food, even then it had recently gone bad. “mary” had a lot of expired food, nearly half a trash bags worth. one thing about me is that i cannot handle moldy or rotten food- and i refuse to live with it. to give better context, i found rotten fish that expired two months ago, and another packet that expired on month ago, rotten eggs, tons of rotten produce in the past, expired dairy products,and moldy beverages to name a few. 
i had given my roommates a heads up that i would be cleaning the fridge out over text, explicitly saying it will only be expired things. after finding the rotten fish, i then texted saying we need to have a talk when we all get back to the apartment.
yesterday, me and another roommate, lets call her “grace” cleaned the kitchen and living room respectively. we had noticed some strange smells in the kitchen, but assumed it was from the trash. while going through the cupboards, i discovered pesto in a plastic container that leaked all over other food products and into the wood (not to mention it REAKED), tons of empty boxes taking up cabinet space,,,, and the real kicker is cereal and oatmeal with bugs in it. we had a fruit fly problem, but i always thought it was because of the kitchen sink, but man was i wrong. the cereal and oatmeal was a breeding ground for the bugs, they were dead, alive, and i swear there was eggs. naturally, as someone with a massive fear of bugs, i yelled for my roommate “grace” to come over and help me throw it away. she then told me that was “mary”’s food. i nearly threw up and cried (bad food and bugs are a horrible combo) and i threw it in the trash
so here is where im confused- this morning my roommate was looking for her bread, to which i told her it was moldy and i threw it out and apologized. she was in a huff and looked for something else. she then asked where her cereal went, to which i said we found a giant infestation of fruit flies and i threw it away. i then leave the room because you could cut the tension with a knife. then, “grace” texts me, telling me that “mary” is very upset i also tossed the (bug infected) oatmeal.

78,1giwkq5,AITAH My girlfriend took my car without permission ,"A year ago, my girlfriend and I met at work, but we've only been dating for 3 months. We became close after she experienced a traumatic event and I wanted to support her due to my own experience with abuse. We fell in love quickly despite our pasts. Although we both have trust issues, we're learning to communicate and work through our disagreements. However, she often threatens to end the relationship when she gets upset, causing stress for me.

Halloween night, we were having fun at my house.  I was trying to clean up before bed, but I was in a lot of pain due to a back injury. I commented ""I feel like a maid."" She instantly got upset. I calmed her down and apologized, telling her I'm  in pain so everything feels harder than normal.

She asked for a ride to get clothes for work the next day, but I'd been drinking and didn't feel safe driving. She said she felt fine, asking to drive my car instead. I agreed, telling her to text me when she was on her way back. She took all her things with her, which seemed odd since she coming back.

After falling asleep briefly, I woke up to find her gone and a text saying she wouldn't be returning my car, but would pick me up for work in the morning. I tried calling her but it went straight to voicemail and she wasn't answering my texts. With a spare car and house key, I decided to take an Uber to her apartment so we could talk. I quickly learned she suspended my access code to get into the apartment complex. I was locked out and unable to contact her. Feeling furious, I ended up driving my car back home, unable to resolve the situation.

She called me in the morning, upset because I was mad at her for taking my car. I explained she can't keep it without permission. I said ""you knew you weren't coming back when you took all her things last night."" Her response was ""so!"" I stated she should've taken an Uber instead. She angrily agreed to return my car and hung up on me. I decided to let her panic by not revealing that I already had the car.  

She called 38 times and texted repeatedly, asking if I had the car, but I ignored her. After 45 min, I called her revealing I had taken it last night to teach her a lesson. She was furious! Saying ""never contact me again, please get help!""

At this point she still had my car keys with my house/mail/parents' keys attached to them. Asking her to bring them back, she ignored me by putting her phone on do not disturb. I warned her I'd call the police if she didn't return them. After waiting and getting no response, I called the police to help. They couldn't come for hours due to being busy. Worried that she may have thrown my keys away, I changed the lock on my front door. Later that day, she returned my keys, including the spare key I gave her, leaving them on my doorstep. I only saw her back as she was leaving, but she seemed sad.

79,1giwifp,AITAH for trashing my brother’s car under my mother’s request?,"Am I the asshole? I(13M, disabled) and my 4 friends, (all 12-13) used my brother(17M)’s car to attend a reptile convention so that I could fit all of them and my wheelchair and my mum. On the way, we took out the candy bag, now since it was two days after Halloween we had a bit of candy left over from giving it out. As we were eating it, our mum laughed and told us to throw the trash anywhere as it was payback because he (my brother) had been doing that to her car all his life. We asked if she was serious and she said yes, please. So we were a bit more careless with where we put our trash. She then told us to wipe our candy on the windows and seats. We told her it may be too much and she said SHE would take the blame and clean it if necessary, then once repticon was over and friends went home, my brother sent this message. He is very conservative Christian (we are not) and I was not aware that one of my friends wrote “gay” on it.

Brother’s text(copy pasted):

“Your friends are no longer welcome in my car. Writing gay on the windows is a complete violation of my boundaries and completely unchristlike, I understand it was a joke, but on top of the fact that this stuff is really hard to get off, they are not allowed back in.”

Followed by a photo of his window with some smudges on it. I feel like I’m def the AH but I’m also conflicted on what my mom should have part of. AITAH?

Edit1: I’ve texted my brother back, also if it was not clear my brother is conservative Christian, mom is non-conservative Christian, I am a Christ believer, and a queer one at that. Anyways my text to my brother said this:

“I’m seriously so sorry. I’ll take responsibility for that and I completely understand. I was under the impression mom would clean it as she told me that, and I should have refused to do it in the first place. I’m very sorry, if there’s anything else still there after your cleaning or any time you need your car cleaned let me know and I’d be happy to do it. When we were in the car she told us she would clean it up, and I also did not realize my friend had written that, very sorry and completely agree with the fact that your boundaries are there for a reason”",Asshole,2024-11-03,"AITAH for trashing my brother’s car under my mother’s request?

As we were eating it, our mum laughed and told us to throw the trash anywhere as it was payback because he (my brother) had been doing that to her car all his life. We asked if she was serious and she said yes, please. So we were a bit more careless with where we put our trash. She then told us to wipe our candy on the windows and seats. We told her it may be too much and she said SHE would take the blame and clean it if necessary, then once repticon was over and friends went home, my brother sent this message. He is very conservative Christian (we are not) and I was not aware that one of my friends wrote “gay” on it.

Brother’s text(copy pasted):

“Your friends are no longer welcome in my car. Writing gay on the windows is a complete violation of my boundaries and completely unchristlike, I understand it was a joke, but on top of the fact that this stuff is really hard to get off, they are not allowed back in.”

Followed by a photo of his window with some smudges on it. I feel like I’m def the AH but I’m also conflicted on what my mom should have part of. AITAH?

Edit1: I’ve texted my brother back, also if it was not clear my brother is conservative Christian, mom is non-conservative Christian, I am a Christ believer, and a queer one at that. Anyways my text to my brother said this:

“I’m seriously so sorry. I’ll take responsibility for that and I completely understand. I was under the impression mom would clean it as she told me that, and I should have refused to do it in the first place. I’m very sorry, if there’s anything else still there after your cleaning or any time you need your car cleaned let me know and I’d be happy to do it. When we were in the car she told us she would clean it up, and I also did not realize my friend had written that, very sorry and completely agree with the fact that your boundaries are there for a reason”",1.0,1.0611695051193237,1,1
80,1giw6uw,AITA If I change my Wedding RSVP after having a plus one rescinded? ,"I have a friend from college that is getting married in 2 1/2 weeks. I got the invitation for the wedding a week ago, and the invite had a QR code which brought you to their wedding website on the knot. 

The wedding is on a Friday, is very last minute, and I will have to take time off of work to attend. 

I am friends with the Bride from college, and we have one mutual friend who is also invited. The mutual friend that we share, however, is unable to attend the wedding so I will not know anyone at the event aside from the Bride. 

When I went to RSVP on the knot it gave me the option to add a plus one. I have never seen this option before without having a plus one invited, so I assumed I was allowed a plus one. I am not in a long term relationship, but because I won’t know anyone at the wedding I asked my friend to attend with me, and added her to my RSVP. 

A few days later I got a text from the Bride saying that I don’t have a plus one and shouldn’t have added my friend and that I cannot bring her. She said she still wants me to attend and that I can make friends with the other guests at the wedding even though I don’t know anyone. I’m guessing bride & groom gave me the plus one by mistake but she didn’t say so or apologize for the confusion, just told me that I shouldn’t have added anyone. 


I am very socially anxious and am now very nervous about attending the wedding on my own. I get very uncomfortable in situations where I don’t know anyone, and now I don’t really want to use my PTO to attend a last minute wedding where I’m not going to know anyone.

At some point in the houses history, a VERY LARGE glass atrium/aviary was built in the middle of the house. It spans all 4 stories, doming out over the roof like a skylight. In it is a mature tree that reaches the 3rd floor, as well as smaller vegetation, a small koi pond, and 2 benches. It is very much the focal point of the house. It's what sold me on the house in the first place. 

The renovations of the house are coming to an end, including the reconstruction of the atrium. Every month, a professional comes to check the thermostat and humidity, misters, water ph, etc. On his next visit, he will bring the birds, teaching me how to care for them in-between visits. It's a huge undertaking and I am very much up to the challenge. 

I have 2 sisters, ashley 25f and Katerina 36f. My relationship is strained at best with them, as I am usually little more than a walking ATM to them. The past year I have started to grow a spine, and they HATE it. I no longer pay their rents and car notes, and I stopped giving them allowances, asking them both to get jobs. They say family helps family, and I've done well for myself, so I should subsidize their lifestyles(very expensive lifestyles, I might add).

During recent conversation, I told them I was excited to get my new birds. I had birds growing up and was eager to start this new adventure again. My oldest sister says what I'm doing is animal abuse, forcing birds to stay trapped inside when birds belong outside. She even threatened to call animal services on me.

That I could be using that money to help my sisters, since I know they did not take a summer vacation this year that I usually pay for each season. They really went in on me hard, to the point I started to cry a little. My younger sister felt a little bad and said she shouldn't have been so harsh but I needed to hear the truth, and my older sister said she had nothing to apologize for. 

I left their apartment on bad terms. They are still really upset with me, saying blood is thicker than water(or in this case, birds).

86,1giv2oq,WIBTA for not paying back boyfriends friend for tube fare?,"My boyfriend (21M) and I (21F) are both big fans of Big Brother, and we recently got tickets to the live eviction show. When my boyfriend mentioned it to a friend from his class (19M), who’s also a fan, we helped him get tickets too. We decided to travel together, so my boyfriend and I bought train tickets for all three of us, and the friend agreed to pay us back for his share on the day of travel.

When we got to the station, my boyfriend realised his railcard was out of date and needed to buy a new one, so he asked his friend if he could pay him back right then so he could cover the railcard cost. The friend wasn’t going to pay us until he was asked, which felt a little awkward, but he paid.

Once we got to London, my card stopped working on the tube, and my boyfriend’s friend offered to let me use his spare card, which I was really grateful for. I made sure to thank him multiple times, and it worked fine throughout the trip. The first time I used it, he scanned it with his phone, and then for every other scan, he gave me the physical card to use directly.

Fast forward to today: he messaged us asking when we could pay him back because he’d been charged £22 for the journey, which seemed really high. For context, my boyfriend’s journey cost about half of that. We feel kind of weird about paying the full £22 because we think he should’ve reached out to TFL first to see if there was an error. We’d be happy to pay what a normal fare would’ve been, but £22 just seems excessive. He has said he can't screenshot his bank to show us the transactions, but it came out in two transactions.

Adding to this, it’s his birthday tomorrow, and he invited us out for drinks because his other friends canceled. But honestly, if we pay the £22, we won’t be able to afford to go out for drinks (student budget). We’re already a bit frustrated that he’s asking us to cover such a high fare when we would’ve never asked that if roles were reversed.

AITA for not wanting to pay the full £22 and feeling like this has made us question his behaviour?

87,1giusck,AITA Was I rude to my neighbour ,"I would like to gauge whether my actions may be considered inappropriate. 

I moved into a four-unit building nearly two years ago, and while I have a good relationship with two of my neighbors, I feel that one neighbor is exhibiting harassing behavior towards me. 

This started a few weeks after I moved in when he commented on how my infant daughter cried during the night—she was only 4 or 5 months old and typically woke up just once. He later remarked on the volume of my laughter. A couple of months afterward, he complained again about noise, specifically mentioning my daughter crying frequently during a time when our household was ill with COVID. Most recently, he has expressed dissatisfaction over my personal life, making comments about intimacy that I feel are unwarranted. For context, my partner and I have a toddler and thus our personal time is limited. He even suggested my partner should ""stick a sock in my mouth"" on a night when I was actually unwell with gastroenteritis, not engaging in the activity he assumed.

He has approached me to express that he finds the walls too thin and requests that we keep the noise down.

I moved into a four-unit building nearly two years ago, and while I have a good relationship with two of my neighbors, I feel that one neighbor is exhibiting harassing behavior towards me. 

This started a few weeks after I moved in when he commented on how my infant daughter cried during the night—she was only 4 or 5 months old and typically woke up just once. He later remarked on the volume of my laughter. A couple of months afterward, he complained again about noise, specifically mentioning my daughter crying frequently during a time when our household was ill with COVID. Most recently, he has expressed dissatisfaction over my personal life, making comments about intimacy that I feel are unwarranted. For context, my partner and I have a toddler and thus our personal time is limited. He even suggested my partner should ""stick a sock in my mouth"" on a night when I was actually unwell with gastroenteritis, not engaging in the activity he assumed.

He has approached me to express that he finds the walls too thin and requests that we keep the noise down.

88,1giumnl,AITA for not reading my best friends mind? ,"I’m going to keep this as short as possible.
Me and my best friend have been friends for years. We’ve been through a lot together. Lately things have been weird for whatever reason. Almost 2 years ago, I lost my baby. My best friend was eh, supportive. Literally two months later, she was about to go into labor with her now 1.5 yearold. I tried to fight back tears as best as I could, but I didn’t want her to hear the sadness in my voice. STILL, I was there for her.
Current day, I have a month and a half left until I deliver. She’s been acting funny towards me the past month and I think it’s BS because I’m having my moment and she’s nowhere to be “found”. 
The past month or so, she has been leaving me on read and I always have to text her 1st even with not receiving any replies. The last time we hung out, she pretty much was ranting to me about all of her problems, and I told her that having a baby was the last thing that she needed because she told me “jokingly” that she wanted another one. The same day, she gave me her Doppler. I didn’t want it because I didn’t want to jinx anything. I tried to leave it at her house and she picked it up telling me not to forget it. My birthday comes, she didn’t even wish me a happy birthday. It’s something childish to get upset over, but she has not missed a birthday the past decade+ we’ve been friends. I had to text her on my birthday and she pretty much was asking for the Doppler back. No problem. Here’s the thing, I refuse to keep driving 35+ minutes to her house. Her and her husband have their own vehicle and one of them should at least make one trip out here to come get it. I’ve made 20. She proceeds to tell me that she’s pregnant and that’s why she wants it back. I just told her oh OK, I’ll give you the Doppler as soon as I can. That was the end of that and still left me on read. 
Let’s be real, am I supposed to be excited or something? All the craziness she goes through, I’m pretty much the nanny every time I go to her house. Her not even two year old hit a vape and sipped a beer can in front of me. I say something about it and it gets blown off? Whatever because who am I? October 1, I sent her my baby shower invitation, didn’t respond. I had my baby shower yesterday, of course she did not show up. She did send me a text a few days ago saying things have been weird between us and that she loves me and that if I ever wanna hang out to just let her know. I told her everything was perfect and that I didn’t need anything, got left on read. I sent her another text to ask how are things going, got left on read again. I’m experiencing the biggest moment of my life and as my best friend, I feel like she should be here like I was for her. My life is going absolutely perfect and with or without her, it will continue to do so. I do want to know if I’m missing something. Did I do something wrong? Is this more than just a Doppler? I’m just falling back and enjoying my peaceful life.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-03,"AITA for not reading my best friends mind?  I’m going to keep this as short as possible.

89,1giufwy,AITA for not attending a memorial with my husband ? ,"It’s important to provide background that my marriage has been in trouble for a few years. We’ve been together for 10, and in the last 3, my husband has developed anger issues, a dependence and overuse of marijuana, food addiction and excessive weight gain. 

Yes I’ve tried to talk to him about all of it, not the point.

He’s told me before that I’m “acting like a fucking bitch” simply for taking naps when I have migraines and he is lonely, eats all of the food in the house, hits inanimate objects over trivial matters like football, etc. 

I mention this because I admit it’s made me distance myself emotionally. 

His stepfather passed away suddenly in January and today a mass was being held at his mother’s church in memory of those who had passed in the last year and she requested we come.

Our plans got jammed together at the last minute, basically because our contractor dropped on us that he would be coming Monday to do a floor repair. Due to previous obligations it would leave me with Saturday evening and Sunday evening to move all of the furniture by myself out of the kitchen and living room before Monday since my husband has a critical back injury and can’t help. 

I admit communication between us probably wasn’t clear last night, as we were both exhausted and he was high and on painkillers for his back. I had suggested I skip the mass to stay home and start moving the furniture. 

This morning, he did not recall the conversation and blew up at me. He was enraged and told me I was letting down his mother. He left by yelling at me to “ENJOY” my
Day. 

I’m feeling bad now, as though I should’ve gone.
