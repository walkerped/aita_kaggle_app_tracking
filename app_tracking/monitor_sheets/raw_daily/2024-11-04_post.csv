0,1gjbmio,AITA for picking a 'disrespectful name'?,"I (18m) am transgender.  
I first came out to my parents 4 years ago, and realised that I'm trans a few months earlier, when I was 13. My parents did not take that well at all. They claimed everything to be a phase, that I'm confused, or that I have some other unresolved issues that cause me to think this.

About two years ago I told my parents that I've picked a name (I'd been using a 'placeholder name' for over 2 years until that point). The name is based on the second name that they gave me when I was born, which is after my grandmother. My current name is the closest masculine version of that after 1 other version which I hate. 

Yesterday, my parents found out that my second chosen name is a male version of my 'original' first name that pretty much sounds the same (think noa/noah). My parents hated it, which I find understandable since they've been struggling from the beginning with me changing my name at all. I specifically picked my name, both first and second, because I wanted to respect my parents and not stray too far from my birth name so that they'd find this pill slightly easier to swallow.

My dad said that I'm extremely disrespectful to make a mockery of their choice like that, and that not consulting with them makes it so much worse. He said that since I only ever think about myself, walk all over their choices, and hurt them all the time, I shouldn't have made a mockery of the name they took effort in picking for me and should just stay with my first name. My mom was also very offended for not asking them beforehand, but they've never so much as called me by my name, even the first name which I thought they were more-or-less fine with? Why would I ask the people who refuse to have the conversation or admit that I'm trans every time I try to bring it up in any way?

1,1gj8fwh,AITA for my top priority not being doing what my mom asked? ,"For context, I(15M) am transgender. I was born female but I identify as male. All my friends and my little sister use the pronouns and name I'm comfortable with, but my mom doesn't. She doesn't purposely do it, but she's not trying not to either. I know it might be hard for a cis person to understand, but being misgendered and deadnamed hurts. It's makes my dysphoria worse and just overall ruins my day.

My mom also will sometimes hit me and my sister. Not very often, not abusively and not enough to leave a bruise, but not just a spank. She also loves to yell and cuss me and my sister out for smaller things like not doing the dishes or not going to bed on time. For like 4 or 5 years, I was also doing all the cooking and cleaning, and making sure my sister was taken care off but a few months ago I put my foot down and refused (got severely punished but at least I'm not acting like my sister's dad anymore).

I don't think this is abuse, but it's enough to make me hate her. I genuinely don't feel any love for my mother anymore. She refuses to acknowledge that I'm her son, not her daughter even though I pass really well (for someone who's not on T yet). Because of this I really don't give a shit when she asks me to do things like the dishes. If anything, I just want to ignore her and piss her off because she feels more like an annoying roommate you can't wait to move out rather than my mother. I still do the thins she asks, but it's not my first priority and sometimes it can take weeks to do something as simple as unload the dish washer. Am I horrible person for feeling like this?
