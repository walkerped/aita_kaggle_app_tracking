0,1gjt2if,WIBTA for dropping out of college?,"so i, 19F, live in a amicable roomate situation with my ex, 21M. this is important because i dont live at home with my parents, we live almost an hour apart. (45-50 minute drive).

iam a sophomore in college, and it's been messy. my freshman year i was at a different college in the far south of my state, almost 3 hours away from my hometown. i switched majors twice while there and i passed most of my classes, but they were easy classes where just showing up could get you an A. just before the end of my freshman year, something serious happened and i ended up leaving school early with accommodations from the accessibility center.  

my parents agreed to let me go to college closer to home, and i moved out just before the school year started. unfortunately, this school's disability center sucks. most of the staff are students, and they turn away most of the people who look for accommodations because they arent physically disabled or their conditions dont seem serious enough for immediate attention. i have debilitating ptsd and asked to have primarily online courses (which this college offers) and to participate in one on-campus class for my major (mortuary science) which requires one four hour lab a week. i was given these accommodations but they seemed to have fallen through because i needed to meet with one of the student staff to walk through it and they kept cancelling on me so they fell through. 

on top of all this i am just failing for a multitude of reasons and i just dont think college is for me for a lot of reasons id rather not delve into. also, my dad has veterans benifits so my college tuition was entirely paid for and all i paid for was class fees, which was like 200. 

im worried ill be the asshole because my parents really really really want me to finish college, like, a full four year program. they havent liked any of the majors i've gone for and keep pushing me to go into the medical field or radiology. they've also tried guilting me into going for bigger fields because they think i dont understand the ramifications of having a lower paying job or no bachelors' or associates degree. they also have this ""dont make my mistakes"" mindset because neither of them finished college and they both went into the military. i also have a rocky relationship with them for a LONG list of reasons. 

honestly, i just hate college and i still care about my parents but i know that if i drop out there's three ways they could respond, and either three of those ways im damaging the relationship i have with them and hurting them in a way. i also dont want my sisters to see me drop out and think of following my lead in not going, but they're smart enough that if i just talk to them about it they wouldn't. i've been thinking of dropping and not telling them for a few days until i figure out what to tell them, or i just tell them afterwards.

2,1gjskoz,AITA for believing financial restitution is warranted immediately,"In laws family yesterday had a gathering. Nephew in law (early 20s), son of my wife’s half brother, accidentally backed over one of my dogs (in his company truck I believe) and broke my 7 year old muts femur requiring surgery or amputation. There were other minor complications, but not worth mentioning because they are easily treatable. 

My father in law phoned my wife, I’m assuming immediately after, and then she told me. I made it down the driveway, less than 500 yards, to where it had occurred. My dog ran off into the woods back towards the house, whereas I had to go into the woods to carry him out. Nephew in law was gone from the scene when I arrived. 

Took my dog to 24 hour vet where ultimately I elected to save his leg at a cost of 7300 bucks…well not to exceed that, but between 6k and 7300. I have not received a call or text from nephew in law who did it or his father that knows about it. 

The story I received from father in law and his brother, while I went into the woods I s that they saw it happen  and tried to get his attention. It didn’t work. I don’t know if my father in law said he’d take care of it and told him to scram….but what I do know is he knows he did it, as it’s been relayed to me from nephew in law to brother in law (nephew in laws father), to father in law, to my wife, and then to me that they feel bad. 

I’m at a loss. I don’t even feel that’s it’s me being mistreated but my entire family, my wife, three kids, and me. No accountability. Didn’t wait to help. I haven’t heard the words I’m sorry. Nothing. I could never be like that to anyone ever, and they know that. He’s a grown man now and needs to face the situation. His dad and grandpa shouldn’t fix this.

Recently our neighbor who lives down the street knocked on our door for the first time (we moved in 4 months ago) and introduced himself before asking us to stop feeding the birds with our 4 bird feeders.

6,1gjrpod,AITA for taking a trip without my husband first?,"When my husband and I dated in 2020 we made a list of cities that we'd like to visit together. To be clear, I never agreed that we had to visit the cities together first before going any other time because I feel going as a couple an going with friends are different experiences. He feels, if I go before him then he doesn't want to go at all in the future.

During engagement, my bridal party asked where I want to so my bachelorette. I said NOLA or vegas (which is a city on the list). They went with vegas. My husband (fiancé at the time) had a conniption. He said he expected us to go together first and did not ever want to go if I went before he. He ended up moving his bachelor activities from the city we live in to vegas to spite me (I feel).

Fast forward, a close friend of mine often celebrates her birthday with a girls trip. I usually go. This coming up year, she is doing Denver. I mentioned going to my husband this morning and an conniption ensued because it is in the ""list"" and we haven't gone yet (nor have plans to go btw).
I really need a girls trip and time away. My husband works retail hours so that leaves me with our 1 year old 3 evenings out the week by myself after I work as well and all day on weekends. So I rarely get a break...ever.

Our marriage is already on the rocks because of lack of connection over time together and emotional damage that occurred during my postpartum time when he behaved selfishly and basically left me to manage things on my own. I felt overwhelmed and abandoned for the first 6 months and still carry the bulk of the load. But now he is feeling a way because he's not getting any since I'm really not connected emotionally. So we've been struggling in marriage. He said he feels disrespect because I'm not considering hiw he feels about wanting to go first with me.

During our disagreement this morning, he stated that my friends are more important than him becausei wanted to go on the trip. I literally have not gathered with friends in MONTHS because I've been covering home duty. It's not a win for me either way though. Either I go and he has an attitude for however long or I stay and I still don't get a break.

Mind you, when we discussed trips in past he has said that he does not like to take off on weekends and we try to limit other off days because he doesn't get alot of them. So we don't really go places as often as I would like especially if we have an international trip the same year. When we do, I'm the one who brings it up and plans it.

7,1gjrhre,"AITA for, in my eyes, helping a friend out.","I (M18) had just finished high school last week and was on study leave. I was returning to the school 2 days after we had finished to pack down some of the sports and pe departments for the day, a few people also put up their hand to help and these people turned out to be some of my friends. 

I had arrived at 8:25am after getting dropped off by my grandfather (M68). About 5 minutes later I had read one of my groupchats where one of my friends had been asking for help as he was at a major bus station with no money or means of transportation. His options were to do the 2.5 hour walk to the school (he was one of the helpers) or to do the 3 hour walk home. 

He instead chose the third option which was to ask someone for help, I was the only one who had seen his text at the time so I offered my help, I bussed to him from my school which took roughly 30-40 minutes. We then bussed to a bus station that was further away as the busses directly back to the school weren't coming for a long time whereas the ones at the bus station further away were more frequent. As we were travelling along another friend saw the message and offered to pick him up, I told him to pick us up at this bus station as we were nearly there anyways plus it worked out better as he lives close by it.

He picks us up in his car and we head on to the school to do help out.

My grandmother (F64) seems to think I was out with 'friends' based solely on my bus card history and believes I lied about the day. She's now highly pissed off because of it and says ""I threw her trust away"" even though she won't simply hear me out or she'll make out to hear me out but is already thinking about her POV and what to say before I even start with mine.

It's lead to a shitty weekend and high tension in the household. She says I wasted her money (technically my grandfather's as she's a housewife) on helping a friend out which I think sounds so insane and selfish, like should we not help out friends in need these days.

10,1gjquni,AITA for telling a wheelchair bound lady her service dogs should not be at the playground.  ,"Throwaway, People are making me feel like i'm nuts here, and I can't believe this is real.  

Last friday my Wife and I took our 2 kids under 3 to the playground in our neighborhood park.  This was a rare Friday where there were no commitments as we usually take them first thing in the morning.    

As we approached we noticed there were probably a dozen kids there and 2 large labs running in the grassy area unleashed.  My wife and I are like the dogs shouldn't be there unleashed but our little guy was excited to be at the playground.  So we continued.  We let our boy run around and the younger one we put in the swing.  Some parents that were there started talking to us.  They are essentially one big neighborhood parent group and meet up weekly.  I didn't know anyone in this group.  

My son climbed a structure and went down a slide.  Once he was off the slide there were no kids on that structure.  A lady that had the 2 dogs there (I still don't know if she was a parent), let the dogs onto the playground structure and let them go down the slide. 

I spoke up to this lady and told her to keep her dogs off the equipment.  She told me they were her service dogs.  I said, i don't think service dogs play on playground equipment.  She snaps back to me service dogs are allowed to take breaks. She continues saying that we are here every week and no one has ever complained.  I say that not everyone is comfortable around dogs and tell her I think its selfish to let your dogs on the equipment especially when children are around.   

Some parents support her and said as much to my wife and I.    She told me that I should make sure my kids are comfortable around dogs before bringing them around dogs.   I told this lady that she was insane and completely missed my point.  My wife and I left after this.  We noticed a facebook post about us (that we have not engaged) and it seems its 50/50 on if we are the assholes.  ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-04,"AITA for telling a wheelchair bound lady her service dogs should not be at the playground.

12,1gjqnxm,AITAH for putting kittens' wellbeing above an old lady's mental health? ,"In the area where I (32F) live there's an old lady (let's call her Martha) who is a bit mentally unwell, I met her at the pet shop buying food, she explained that she looked after a colony where someone dumped a bunch of cats and therefore the colony went from 4 neutered cats to 22 cats. I said I'd help her with TNR after I did some fundraising.

I then learnt from neighbours that the colony is actually a byproduct of Martha not spaying her own cats and at one stage 10 years ago there were 50 cats in the colony all inbred with health issues and someone poisoned a few of them because of the smell and this caused Martha a lot of mental health issues. Eventually cats got spayed and over the years the outside cats died out and there's only 4 left from the original ones. People know about this place so someone dumped 2 unwanted females there a year ago and now there's lots of cats once again.

I went over to do TNR and she told me she only wanted me to TNR the 3 mom cats who had already had litters as they got to experience motherhood. I explained it doesn't work that way.

There were 5 kittens who I thought were 3 weeks old because they were tiny. They were actually 6 weeks old as they were newborns when I met Martha the first time. I asked the rescue for help and they found a foster for the small kittens. When I spoke to Martha she started freaking out that I wanted to take the kittens so I said I wouldn't and left it alone. 2 weeks later I went back to TNR some more cats and the kittens had not grown at all. 


I explained to Martha that the kittens were way too small and I needed to take them to the vet and to the foster family. After talking for a while she started to agree with me, but once I actually caught the kittens and took them away she had a massive freak out and panic attack and told me I had betrayed her and kept saying to bring the kittens back to the colony.

Kittens were half the weight they were meant to be for their age, full of worms and ringworm. They are with an experienced foster now dewormed and on high calorie kitten food and kitten milk. They most likely would not have survived in the wild.

A few of my friends said that I am upsetting an old lady with bad mental health for some cats and am traumatising her. Also they said that the shelter could've just helped some other cats since they don't have resources to help every single cat and they could have just left these kittens alone so Martha wouldn't have been upset. I've honestly been feeling awful about myself and I don't know if I've done the right thing now after speaking to them.

I guess I know there's lots of kittens waiting to go into foster and I could have just told the foster team to take someone else in, I know that because the foster team took these kittens in there are kittens out there that won't get a spot but I wasn't really thinking about it in those terms.

14,1gjqez3,AITA for maybe overreacting when my friend accepted an offer I made?,"Me (F14) and my best friend (F15) go out to Dunkin a lot, whenever we want a sweet treat or want to chat or just need a break from people. I am normally the one who pays for these meals despite not having a job or source of money and iykyk, Dunkin is pretty expensive, so we normally go out only once or twice a month. My friend, Beth, is a lot more popular than I am. I mean if we hadn't been friends since elementary school, we wouldn't be friends now. Our friendgroups are completely different and I don't see her a lot because she is always doing something with someone. So our Dunkin trips probably seem like just another day for her while they are typically the highlight of my week. 

I recently have had the worst week of my life and planned a while ago to meet with Beth and talk to her about it. The day comes and she texts me in the middle of the school day asking if we can go after the football game. I say sure, she can just walk up to my house after it, and I also offer that we can go on Wednesday if she really wants. She says she will walk up to my house after the game. So I get home and I wait. An hour goes by and I text her asking what time she will come by. She says 6:30. Dunkin closes at 6:30. I tell her that and she explains that not only is she at the football game, but she promised multiple people that she would see the volleyball game too, and that starts at 6. So I got frustrated and asked her why she had to be at both. She didn't give me a real answer: ""Idk ppl asked me to"". So I told her to just forget about going to Dunkin with me, today or Wednesday, and she of course asked if I was upset, asked why not. I told her I wasn't upset, just annoyed. I declined her offer of going sometime else.

I understand that she is a very busy person. I'm very accepting of this. I've had to deal with feelings of being left out for years now. It hurts me that she throws our plans away so easily, and I know I offered that we could go on a whole different day, but that was before I found out she promised people she would go to games today. It hurts me that my time and money is less important than her friends and if I never messaged her she wouldn't have told me she made herself busy at all. I'm not in tears about this. I'm honestly just bummed and don't feel like talking about my week anymore, which makes me feel lonely again. 

And then on her side, I made the offer to go on a different day. Nothing was out of the ordinary from her perspective and I guess she just took the offer. I know she doesn't mean to hurt me.

17,1gjq7w0,AITA for asking my friend to split the towing fee?,"I'm 30 and my friend is 35 and we became recent friends for 6 months who had a lot in common and started partying a lot. I rarely drive and only rent a car for work purposes. I happened to have a car one weekend and my friend lives 45 mins from me and she wanted me to come to her house first before we headed to a bar that was 10 minutes from her. I asked her how parking would be, and she mentioned there is a CVS she always parked and there would be no problem. She instructed me where to go and I trusted her where we should park. We were at the bar for 2 hours and came back to my car missing. I was furious because part of me knew I shouldn't have parked at a CVS but she insisted it would be fine, given that she is familiar with the area and ""parks there all the time"". After later discovering the sign and further reading it, I was able to retrieve the address to pick up my car.

Mistakes happen -- however, she did not offer to go in an Uber with me to pick up my car. She ubered home and I went to figure out my car situation myself at 1:30am. It cost me $50 to Uber to the towing company and another $500 to release it. The next morning, I explained to her the situation and she apologized and ""swore"" this has never happened before. I asked if she could contribute half, given it was her idea where we should park. She sent me $100 and said this is what she felt was fair on her part and because it was my car, I'm responsible. Although she was legally correct, morally I feel betrayed and no longer trust her. I do not drive often and the once in a blue moon I offered to drive, she provided me with incorrect information that has now put me in debt. After explaining to her my disapproval of not splitting this mess with me, she informed me to ""feel free to take legal actions if you wish"". This comment impacted my thoughts to cut ties with her, who clearly did not want to take any responsibility and would rather recommend legal action to fight her over this rather than providing that extra $150 to cover half of the bill or at least offer to buy dinner or drinks or something to make me feel like she genuinely feels bad and wants to make up for it. The fact she wanted me to consider legal action didn't see like a fair turn of events.

I understand legally, she doesn't have to pay anything, but as a friend, I would expect at least half since we are both accountable for this poor decision and I relied on her to take us somewhere safe, given she indicated that she knew the area. It would have been a different scenario, in my opinion, if I decided to park without her input and this happened.

18,1gjq4fb,AITA for uninviting my brother's ex-girlfriend to my wedding?,"28F, getting married in \~2 weeks.  

My brother (Kevin, 25yo) had been dating a woman (Brittany, 25yo) for a few months.  During their relationship, Brittany became increasingly controlling and manipulative; ex: she would FaceTime him and if he didn't answer she would blow up his phone trying to figure out where he is, what he is doing.  They fought constantly, big blowup arguments several times a month.   He's in recovery and doing really well, and she would often bring that up, saying he might as well have kept drinking or making sure that she told him in detail when she would go out drinking with her friends while they were fighting.  If he had a day off and didn't spend it with her, there would be a fight.

Kevin was getting to the point where he was actively unhappy in the relationship.  He said he couldn't picture himself marrying her, and he and was thinking about ending the relationship.  He is in my wedding, and I was going to let him have a +1 

Brittany broke up with him about 2 weeks ago (\~4 weeks before the wedding).  Kevin let me know the next day.  I talked with my fiancé, and we went ahead and removed her from the guest list.  All of our RSVPs came in and we gave the final guest count to the caterer.  

Since then, Kevin and Brittany have started talking again.  This weekend I talked to Kevin and told him that we did not include Brittany in the guest list.  I wanted to make sure we were on the same page, though I assumed she was planning not to come since they hadn't gotten back together at this point.  He asked me what he should tell her, because evidently a couple of days prior she asked him if he still wanted her to come to the wedding, and he told her that it would be fine.  He also mentioned that she had already bought a dress, and said that telling her she cannot come will cause a fight.  I told him to blame it on me and tell her it was completely my and my fiancé's decision.  I also told him that I don't want her to cause drama or add stress for me on the day of the wedding or negatively impact him being able to enjoy the day.  He said he understood and he would tell her.

Today he messages me and asks if it would be possible to let her come anyway, because she has cleared her schedule the day of the wedding so that she can come.  I told him that I'm sorry, I think it's best that she doesn't come.  I offered to have the conversation with her myself if that would help.

19,1gjq1ps,AITA for not inviting my dad to an awards ceremony,"TL;DR I didn't invite my dad to an awards ceremony because he complained during my graduation ceremony

Last year, I graduated military college. The ceremony was held at a very prestigious hall, usually reserved for high-up officers. I was allowed 2 guests so I invited my mum and grandad (who had been in the army). I didn't invite my dad because I knew it's not his thing and that he would be bored, he's not the type of person for formal events so I thought I was doing him a favor by not inviting him.

He was very upset that I hadn't even asked him before I asked my grandad (which I now understand) and caused a huge argument, it divided my entire family. So I pleaded with the college to allow me a 3rd guest, which was a privilege to receive.

But the entire ceremony, he complained. He complained about every little detail; the line was too long, there were too many people, the ceremony was boring. He was saying these things very loudly so that all my classmates and teachers could hear. It was humiliating. This graduation had everything that I was proud of, it felt degrading.

So now I am nominated for student of the year at my new college, I do not want him at the awards ceremony, I do not want him ruining another special event.  
My parents' initial reaction to this news was annoyance because they were planning to go on vacation during that week, so they had to delay. And my dad also complained to his friend that he didn't want to go, while I was in the room.

My family are, once again, against me and now my mum is threatening not go to without my dad because of how upset he will be. I am starting to feel guilty for not inviting him, especially because I want my mum to be there. He is my dad so he should automatically be invited and I don't want him to feel like a bad father but I don't want a repeat of last time. And they did move their vacation for me, I don't want to be ungrateful for all that they've done for me.

20,1gjpijp,AITA not wanting my sister's dog near my kid? ,"My sister and her boyfriend have a Rhodesian Ridgeback, he's almost 2yo, very playful and impetuous. He's huge, but still a puppy, so he's acting like every puppy, I guess, and plays in quite a physical way (chewing your foot or elbow). 

I'm not a dog person. Since I had my son (19mo) I'm quite anxious when dogs are around, especially big dogs and especially unleashed. So my sister's dog and my son are never ever ever left together with the dog unleashed. Again, he is very impetuous. I know he wants to play, but still I'm uneased. 

This weekend my sister, her bf and their dog went to a trip in the mountains where they could leave the dog free almost all the time. She was excited and said he was a good boy, let some kids pet him (they're training him because he didn't like people touching him) and that sometimes we could make the same trip together. I said of course, as long as the dog has the leash, otherwise no problem: I'll hold my son on my shoulders or in my arms for the time the dog would run unleashed. She complained that it's unfair she couldn't do trips with both the dog and her nephew, but has to choose between the two and she can't leave the dog alone for much time because they're already work all day and he gets lonely. I didn't ask her to choose, of course, just remarked I don't want big impetuous dogs around my son: he is very gentle towards animals (we have two cats), but he still could do something to piss the dog. Or the dog could hurt him while playing. I'm not taking that risk.

I admit I don't like her dog very much. I'm a cat person, but I also love a friend's greyhound because she's quite and gentle and well behaved. I let my son play with the greyhound with my supervision but with no big worries. 

AITA towards my sister? I don't want to take away from her activities with her nephew, but I have a problem with her dog unleashed around my son.

21,1gjoloj,AITA for refusing to ditch my friend to take my husband to an event he previously declined?,"Last year, it was announced the 2024 Pokemon World Championships were to be held in Honolulu. I (39F) don’t play the TCG, but my husband (44M) and I play the switch games, Pokemon Go and more recently, Pokemon Sleep. I did research about last year’s event and the best way to obtain spectator passes. From what I read online, Nintendo is notorious for crowd control and passes are given out on a lottery basis. There was an interest list which opened the beginning of June so I asked my husband if he would like to go. He quickly declined because he gets anxious with big crowds. I said “I’d like to attend, so I’m going to put my name on the interest list; let me know if you change your mind.” I was worried about getting a 3-day pass, let alone a 1 day, but I submitted my name and hoped for the best. Around the beginning of July, I received an e-mail. I’d been selected for a Friday pass! I was super excited and immediately registered. There was an option to bring a guest, so I paid for 2 passes. 

A few weeks later, I ran into my college classmate (we’ll call him Karl) and he told me he was bummed about not getting a spectator pass. He made an appointment for the pop-up Pokemon Center to buy merch for his daughter, but as someone who used to compete in TCG, he wanted to watch the local players. I didn’t immediately mention my extra spectator pass, so I went home to make one last attempt to invite my husband. Again, he said no. I said I’m going to extend my extra pass to my classmate and daughter, and he said: “go have fun with your friend”.

As we get closer to August, more events, merch, and activities were announced. Karl and I planned to pick up our passes on Thursday, check out the Trainer Village at Hilton Hawaiian Village, and take his daughter to the meet-and-greets. On Friday, we would check out the booths between rounds and of course, buy lots of merch. At this point, my husband is experiencing extreme FOMO. A week before the event, he approached me and asked me to take him instead. I told him no because I already registered Karl as my guest and he paid me for his admission pass. In addition, Karl added me to his Pokemon Center reservation. My husband brought up his therapist told him it was important we actively make/spend time together and I was not holding up my end of the bargain. I calmly told him after he said no, I extended another invite (which he declined) before I asked Karl. I also said it was inappropriate to use our therapy tools in this situation because I had no intention of excluding him or keeping him out of the loop; he was always my first choice. 

FYI: Sadly we didn’t get our hands on all the merch we wanted due to the scalpers, but we did walk away with lighter wallets.

So am I the AH for not taking my husband and not feeling guilty about it?

TL;DR - Won 1-day spectator passes for Pokemon World Championships, husband twice declined. Offered guest pass to classmate and daughter, and husband was upset I wouldn’t take him.

22,1gjoh2q,AITA (AWTA) for letting a friend travel to a football game on his own by a train while we travel together by car,"Hi. Me and my friends (let's call them John, Andy and Gary) are fans of a football (soccer) club that plays an away game which is an 5-6 hours drive away from our city.

We all like travelling to away games as it's really fun and somewhat of a badge of honour for a football fan.

As soon as the game was drawn, we all agreed we would definitely visit it together.

However, the number of tickets allocated for the public sale for the fans of our club were limited (around 700) and there was a very big demand for them (lower thousands of people trying to grab them).

Andy, Gary and I lucked out and managed to grab tickets in the public sale from our club, while John failed to do so because of the large demand. 

It then came out that the club allocated the rest of the tickets to ultras, fan groups, sponsors and so on. But I repeat, this only became known after we managed to secure tickets.

John then decided to travel with the ultras, who organised a train trip for the fans. The train arrives a few hours before the game and leaves straight after it. It was really his only option to be able to visit the game.

Our plan from the start was to travel by car. And that's what Andy, Gary and I are going to do. It's far more convenient and also cheaper than the train. The car journey there and back will cost around $90 between the three of us, while a ticket for the train with the ultras would be the same price for each one of us.   
All of us are university students and Gary also has a child on the way, so the money aspect does play quite a big part in this. Another, smaller, factor was that us three want to spend the night in the city our club plays in, and then travel home the next day. John needs to travel back with the ultras by the train because he needs to make it back for school the next morning.

John tried to convince us multiple times to travel with him by the train as he doesn't want to travel alone (totally understandable). But to us three there's just really no upside apart from not being bad friends.

So, are we the assholes for letting him travel on his own, while we take the cheaper, much more convenient route, just because we lucked out in the public sale?

My BF and I went to a pumpkin patch the weekend before Halloween as I love this season and wanted to do the ‘couply’ thing of pumpkin picking and carving. When we completed the pumpkins I was excited to light them so we asked his siblings if they had any tealights at home -BF lives with me and they live with mum. Sister (18F) asked mum if we could come take some and she said yes so we drove over to grab a few (they live 5-10minute drive away).

When we got to Clare’s house she asked us what we did that day and why we wanted the candles. My BF replied telling her about the pumpkin patch and that we bought 3 pumpkins of varying sizes but at that point had only carved the large ones. When he went to tell her about the third one being small and possibly offer half the pumpkin for consumption, as he knows Clare loves to cook with it, she started telling him about how she’s Christian and she won’t celebrate paganism in her house (which is understandable but not in the context). She continued to talk over him while he kept trying to explain that he was trying to offer it as food, saying “let me finish, let me finish” over and over as Clare kept making this offer about religion, even though he is very aware of her religious beliefs and lack of holiday celebrations. My BF was blatantly annoyed at this point from body language and tone getting more abrupt with each repetition of “let me finish”. 

After about 2minutes of this I spoke over the pair of them saying “Clare, we were actually offering you the pumpkin as FOOD to COOK with” and she immediately responded “SHUSH” with that I walked into the living room to talk to the siblings as I get along with them well and I love hanging out with them and their cats. Not long after my BF and Clare joined us in the living room, I was being quiet petting one of the cats when Clare started telling me “how rude I was.” 
(Context; I have depression and anxiety, I’m on medication and doing therapy currently - Clare is very aware and also aware of my childhood trauma with being yelled at and things of that nature)
Clare kept berating me about how rude I was for “talking over her” and she started making it personal about me not the pumpkins. She’s aware of my style(I’m a bit of an e-girl/emo type, colourful hair, tattoos, piercings, wear a lot of black). I told her that I understand that Halloween is a pagan holiday originally but I’m not carving pumpkins or dressing up due to that but because I love all things spooky, but not only that, Halloween is a money grab nowadays not a “real holiday”. 

In the end I ended up cutting her off as she kept telling me how I can’t celebrate Halloween, baring in mind I don’t live with her, and making personal comments and so I replied “sorry Clare but I really don’t like the way you’re speaking to me, so I am going to leave your house as I am apparently a problem”.

I’ve been through a lot lately. I was recently (10 days ago) discharged from the psych ward after a suicide attempt and was diagnosed with a severe panic disorder, following a drug overdose a few months ago as another suicide attempt . I also have autism, ADHD, and PTSD, and the hospital environment wasn’t suitable for my sensory needs, so I left a week ago. Right now, I’m staying at a friend’s place where I feel safe and am working on adjusting my medication. Alex has visited and even stayed at this friend’s house a few times, though they hadn’t met before.

For the past six weeks, I’ve actually been living out of my office so that Alex could stay in my apartment rent free, as he’s here from another country and hasn’t yet found a place to rent. I’m trying to be supportive, especially since he’s been stressed about his mother’s hospitalization in the US.

Recently, Alex wanted to talk about my future plans as I mentioned that I couldn't afford to take such a long time off work and needed to move back in with my parents in another country and have a serious long term break to avoid stress. I explained that right now, I need to prioritize my mental health and limit stressful conversations. But instead of understanding, Alex was dismissive and harsh. He told me he didn’t care about my boundaries and said he had “worse problems.” , he demanded to have a conversation about his life struggles and said his life was in limbo, I had set a boundary that I didn't have the capacity to take on stress or drama and was sorry that his mum was unwell, but it would be better to talk to somebody else about it as I currently don't have the capacity to take on stresa. 

At one point, he said I was playing in the “victim Olympics” and implied that I’m somehow the “common denominator” in conflicts. He even suggested I was being manipulative and that I needed do get the capacity because he needed to have the conversation.

This was really upsetting, as I felt like he was tearing me down rather than respecting my need for space. I explained that his comments were making my panic attacks worse, and that I needed to focus on staying grounded and avoiding unnecessary stress right now.

After the conversation I relapsed on drugs after 60 days clean and had a panic episode which involved me dislocating my knuckle by punching a wall in a night terror flashback. This was traumatising for my friend who's house I was starting at and he suggested that I completely cut out Alex moving forward as his behaviour is unhealthy.

I told Alex that I can’t keep having these conversations right now and that I need him to respect my boundaries. He, however, has implied that I’m overreacting and being difficult.  I need to protect my mental health, and I am letting Alex stay in my apartment rent free for the next two weeks until he can go back home - despite not wantibg to but not wanting him to be in a vulnerable situation,but I still wonder if I’m being unreasonable here, especially considering that Alex is going through a lot as well.

",TL;DR,2024-11-04,"AITA for asking my friend to respect my boundaries during my recovery, even though he’s been staying in my apartment?  Hi, Reddit. I could really use some perspective on a recent situation with my friend Alex (name changed).

I’ve been through a lot lately. I was recently (10 days ago) discharged from the psych ward after a suicide attempt and was diagnosed with a severe panic disorder, following a drug overdose a few months ago as another suicide attempt . I also have autism, ADHD, and PTSD, and the hospital environment wasn’t suitable for my sensory needs, so I left a week ago. Right now, I’m staying at a friend’s place where I feel safe and am working on adjusting my medication. Alex has visited and even stayed at this friend’s house a few times, though they hadn’t met before.

For the past six weeks, I’ve actually been living out of my office so that Alex could stay in my apartment rent free, as he’s here from another country and hasn’t yet found a place to rent. I’m trying to be supportive, especially since he’s been stressed about his mother’s hospitalization in the US.

25,1gjnjfp,AITA for inviting friends to events where I know one person in the group can't attend?,"I have a relatively new group of friends (have known each other for about 2 years). 4 of us live in different neighbourhoods in the same city and 1 of us lives in an adjacent city. None of us have regular access to a car and rely on public transit or uber. 

When we first started hanging out we focused on weekend afternoons because those were the only times when everyone could attend. We were able to meet about once a month that way and otherwise kept in touch via a group chat. 

After a few months of chatting we started getting closer and I decided to start inviting them out to more events. We started hanging out more frequently and now meet 1-2 times per week. 

Here is where the conflict is - my friend who lives in an adjacent city is still able to come to weekend afternoon events but is missing everything that occurs in the evening or on a weeknight because she can't get there in time (or get home afterwards) via public transportation and uber is too expensive. She is basically able to attend 1/8 events at this point and has expressed feeling left out. 

We didn't really come to a solution because while I said I'd try to find more things we can do on weekend afternoons, I also didn't want to be limited to that. We also talked about looking for things to do in her neck of the woods, but this would just lead to a reversal of the situation (where most of us in the city wouldn't be able to get to her suburb in time or would have trouble getting home afterwards).

26,1gjngxj,AITA for not asking for the name of someone I just met?,"I'm the president of a student organization at my graduate school, and I gave a speech earlier in the fall semester  (September) at an event where many student org presidents gave speeches to an audience. Last weekend, our organization had a formal event that we host every early November. This year, we had it at a venue that was a little further out than where most people live. Students who were not members of the organization (those who hadn't paid dues) were allowed to attend as well. During the first five minutes, there weren't many people there (under ten) and I knew all of the people until another guy came in. As he came in, I smiled and nodded at him. He approached me and said ""Hey, you're \[my name\] right?""

""Yes!"" I said

""Knew it. I remember you from your speech you gave back in September!"" he said.

""Excellent, glad that you came here. Getting down to this venue wasn't too much of a hassle, was it?"" I asked.

Without answering my question, the guy just said ""Too cool to bother asking for my name?"" His tone did not sound passive aggressive, but at the same time it did not sound like he was joking around; I had never met this guy anyhow, so I don't know his style of joking. His enthusiasm while talking to me seemed to dip as he said this.

He then told me his name and excused himself to go use the restroom.

I felt bad because people at our school have talked about student org presidents being cliquey and not really caring about anyone outside of their group that they aren't already friends with. I'm sad that this is how I may have come off to this guy by not immediately asking for his name after he confirmed mine. At the same time, what he said seemed like it could've been passive aggressive, and passive aggressiveness isn't really the type of thing that you want when you make friends with someone. AITA?

In the past, there have been issues with them not helping plan at all and it is usually up to me and my other friend to make all the plans and organize everything. This leads to some issues with some of them not being happy. So a month prior I sent them a list of different activities, places to eat & drink. I asked them to review the list, do research & let me know what they want to do. I didn’t hear anything back weeks later so I reminded them again. The day before they leave, I asked them to make sure they tell me when they leave and arrival time so I can plan accordingly. Hours after they were supposed to leave I didn’t hear anything. I was then informed they left almost 3 hours ago. They were unable to rent a car because they didn’t book one until the night before they left but got here eventually.

 

Day 1 was nice, I told them we’re going to the beach. Had a great day, while we were leaving another car got stuck and blocked the exit ramp. I helping out, I asked my friend to go up there and get my strap while I drive the truck out, he got mad and said he wasn’t going to do that. I was like are you being serious? I could use some help here and we went back and forth for a minute and he reluctantly got out and did it.

 

Next day, me & fiancé made breakfast, 2 woke up and sat on their phones, didn’t offer any help. Once everyone was awake, I asked what is the plan. Nobody said anything, my one friend was trying to get them to participate, me and him were talking about different options and things to do and no one else said anything. It is a beautiful day outside and we haven’t done anything. The only thing they came up with was to sleep until noon, go to some bars, then come back to the house and drink around a table for probably 8 hours with no thought of dinner or anything. I got fed up and said something and was probably a little harsh / yelled.  Eventually we end up going to dinner and get lucky with a table at a nice restaurant. We pull into the place; the one gets out and throws up & on the car next to us. I am done at this point. I didn’t want to go in anymore and got mad once again, but they insisted he’ll be fine and we end up eating there.  I want to add I didn’t know that he got it on another until we I got home.

34,1gjmhpl,AITA for starting a biz,"Hello my brother's girlfriend, R ( 23F ) has been having a one-sided beef with me ( 17F ) for the past week.

For context, I recently started a small business making DIY bracelets, and i've been putting a really consistent amount of effort into. R had started the same type of business a few months ago, and hence, is really unhappy and telling everybody that i'm toxic for copying her.

I found this out through an instagram story she had made on her private account, which I was in, where she complained about how "" no matter what time phrase she's in, there will always be toxic people copying her "" and how the person who copied her is the most disgusting and shameless person she's ever met. I'm sure this is about me because 1). My brother stays with my grandma and R was at my grandma's that day, so my grandma probably told her about it, and 2). When my friends asked to see her business instagram account, I had found out I was blocked.

I understand that R may feel frustrated about me starting the same kind of business as her, as i've supported her in the past, which was just out of my own goodwill of wanting to help her out, so she may feel "" stabbed in the back "". However, I had told her the first time i bought from her that i've been wanting to start the same business, but I just have not found any suppliers for the beads I wanted to use, which she then laughed off.

What's infuriating to me is that R straight up posted our "" dirty laundry "" on social media, without confronting and asking me about it first. I wanted to confront her, but that would feel like "" admitting "" that I copied her, letting her win in a way. 

Also, R has been complaining to almost all of my immediate family and her friends, trying to paint me as a bad guy. While, this would have been totally understandable if it was just her friends, I don't understand the need to bring my family into this issue? 

In my opinion, while I can understand that I may be TA because I started the same business as R, but R had also started the business because she was inspired by a friend... What's the difference between me and her 😭 Honestly, I feel like this whole thing is blown out of proportion as it's a really small matter that could have been resolved easily if she talked to me about it first...

35,1gjmfed,AITA For telling my sister off and getting her candles blow out after she left them unattended for an hour with playful young cats?,"So for a bit of context, I 21M live with my mom 56F, my brother 19M and sister 18F. My sister is the kind of person that has everyone around her walking on eggshells, and while I do my best to be a supportive older brother, I mostly just do as my younger brother does and try to avoid her best I can.

Basically, I came out of my room to go down for a smoke and spotted my sister's bedroom door wide open with multiple candles burning. I had heard her go downstairs like 45-50 minutes ago, so I was a bit worried about how long she had left them unattended especially because one of them was really close to some clothes she had hanging over her closet door. If she had jst gone downstairs to grab something I woldn't have been botthered, but she had been gone for almost an hour and we have two very playful young cats that love to chase each other throgh rooms and tend to knock things over.

So when I went down I told her to either go back to her room to keep an eye on her candles or blow them out, which did earn me a nasty look but she agreed and said once our mom answered a question for her she would. So I went out for a smoke expecting her to have gone back up once I got back in. I smoke cigarillos that usually take me like 10 mins to finish, so I though it was plenty of time. I should have known something was up when she let both the cats out as she has a habit of trying to half cover her tracks and minimize stuff to still get her way, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. But when I came back in she was still downstairs.

So I said I would just blow them out myself, which caused her to throw a whole fit about me not being allowed to go in her room let alone blow out her candles. Luckily in a rare show od a backbone my mom said she would go see if it really was a hazard, which lead to my sister trying to pull my mom off the stairs and when she failed, to pushing ahead of her. My mom did say she better not be changing anything but of course she did, the candles close the the clothes were blown out by he time my mom got there. My mom ended up blowing ot the other candles and I was going to leave it there.

But my sister decided she was going to tear into me for being so stupid and asking why I even cared. Well I have priceless antique books in the room next to hers was one reason, but also I worried for the cats. One of our previous cats who passed of old age not to long ago had in the past gotten burned by an unattended candle and she was older and less careless at that time than out current cats are now. Which of course just prompted more yelling. My brother heard the commottion and told me to just leave it because it was a loosing battle, and my mom as always came to her defense and told me off.

I don't know why this incident in particular bothers me but it does, and it geninely has me wondering if I did make a mountain ouut of a molehill. I was just worried about our cats... And a potential house fire.

So, AITA?

Edit: Based on the comments I can easily agree that yeah, I should have just put them out myself and dealt with whatever yelling may or may not have followed. It's a good learning moment that in cases of genine concern I shouldn't be more worried about how my sister will react and instead just do what should be done.

36,1gjlzay,AITA for screwing my parents and leaving their house ,"I (19F) was adopted into my family when I was in middle school. My adoptive parents have always had a weird relationship with us. Most importantly my “mom”. She never called me or my other siblings her “real kids” or never treated us like it. She favors the boys in our house a lot more than the girls, especially my youngest sibling. She has always called him her real kid and treats him like a spoiled brat. My other younger siblings get picked on and bullied by my parents and if I stood up for them, I’d get yelled at and punished. My mom especially liked to pick on me, about my looks, my intelligence, and my interests. She caused a lot of damage in my self esteem and continues to do so in my relationship. Growing up with them, they always wanted a big amount of control over me and always had to have a grasp on what I was wanting to do with my life. I was an outcast for not working in the family business and they bullied me relentlessly during that period. My dad made me quit my job. (After saying he was okay with it, he’s very unpredictable). They never allowed me to explore on my own and kept me tied down to their household.

Anyways, my fiancé recently moved in with me and my parents house. Which I’ve come to realize was a big mistake. I never should have brought him here and everything had become worst. My mom talks badly about my partner and then says the nicest things to his face. She put more responsibilities on me even though I have been taking care of dogs and her kids (she owns 11 dogs). She continues to belittle and refuses to help me get a job. (We don’t have a car yet since my partner just moved across the country). I’ve tried working with them and finding odd jobs but it’s impossible to be hired anywhere anymore. But recently I had told my parents about my recent engagement, explaining that it’s going be a long one and that it’ll be a few years until we have a wedding. My mom then looked at my fiance and asked him if he was sure about marrying me. In that moment, I realized how much my mom cared about me. She had emotional damaged me for years and never tried to help me succeed. She only had kept me around and wanted me to stay in her house because I do everything. I am nothing but a housekeeper and dog sitter to her. I’m not a daughter to her. So in two weeks, I am packing everything up and leaving this house. I’m not telling anyone and I’m leaving very early in the morning. I will not stand for the disrespect and abuse anymore, and she will be screwed without me. They will have no one to watch the dogs while my mom works and my dad drinks until he passes out for the rest of their lives. They will have no one to help feed their kids. I know I’m leaving a mess behind me and I do feel a little guilty. But I don’t think I care anymore but I would like to hear if it’s normal to feel a little guilt.

It’s important to know that it’s a classic play, but with a secondary storyline added by us that’d be a modern parallel of the original text. For this B story we hadn’t yet written all the scenes, but did have a fairly good vision (in my mind). Only the ending we still disagreed on, especially me and Jess.

Last week we had auditions and on Friday sat together to decide on the casting. During this meeting 4 new roles for the B story get invented (there were 3 before). I already had and expressed doubts about this then, but only in the weekend could articulate them properly.

Emma and Jess had busy weekends so I texted that I felt this was a big and rushed decision into unknown territory and a mistake. The additions felt like a step away from the vision we’d worked on together for the past 2 months. I didn’t yet have an idea what these roles would add and we’d need to fully rebuild the B story around these roles if we’d cast them already, since we’d be stuck with them.

Jess responded that we didn’t have much of a clear vision on the B story yet and that if we did we’d have the script already. Emma responded that she felt the decision was already made on Friday and it was 2 against 1.

I urged to discuss this point at the meeting Monday as it was big deal to me. We’d planned it way before specifically to finally finish the B story cause Jess wanted a script done this week. Discussing this on Monday however would mean delaying the casting announcements by a day or 2 and Emma and Jess didn’t want to delay it any further and risk seeming unprofessional. So, as I felt the discussion was still going on, Jess sent out the casting announcement already.

Feeling very disrespected and ignored I sent the announcement to the one guy who didn’t make the cast since I’d promised to and left the production yesterday.

I like to think I am very okay with things not often going my way, but I hate big sudden irreversible decisions that I feel weren’t at all thought out. So while I was bothered by the choice to add these 4 completely new roles that didn’t yet have a purpose I was more upset about how the decision was made. I wanted to discuss this at the B story meeting and all that’d need to be done was for the casting announcements to be delayed a day or 2.

I also left because I’ve been in projects before where I had a role that deserved some respect, but was ultimately ignored or not taken seriously.

Which means as of right now she's only 5 days out of recovery today. Yesterday my stepdad went out on a bender to some golfing place where he already got hammered, I picked him up and he asked me to take him to the casino (he has a gambling problem already and a drinking problem where he goes through almost 15-20 cans of beer a day) where he was for almost 3 more hours before coming home. 

I had to work in the morning so I went to go to bed and I overheard him come home and not even 5 minutes into being home he's ordering my mom to get him a beer, to give him a menu of what we have in the house so SHE can make him something to eat, and to let the dogs out. Again she's 4 DAYS out of surgery for a full hysterectomy at the time of this happening. Naturally upon hearing this I got up and went downstairs saw the literal pain in my mom's face from begining to do those chores and told her to go sit down and relax. I then stood there and waited for him to ask for another beer like he usually does. 

When he did I told him ""go get your own beer right now"" to which he wined my name at me and I added ""my mom is 4 days out of surgery..."" And that's when he laughed and turned up his music using his surround sound so loud that he couldn't hear me. So I immediately went and dumped out all 50 beers he had in the fridge. Every single one.

My mom begged me to go upstairs so I did and I overheard him yelling at her so I went back down and blew up on his about what I'm arguing is abuse for making my mom do chores 4 days after a full hysterectomy and I called him a lazy POS for doing what he did. It was a whole big thing. Now after he's finally sobered up he's demanding we apologize to him for damaging his property and talking to him like that in ""his own home"" and that he doesn't need to apologize for anything because he didn't do anything wrong. 

He is now demanding that we either 1. I apologize completely for everything we did Or 2. My mom kicks me out because now he no longer feels safe in his own home because he now thinks I'm gonna be at his ass and break his property because of me pouring out all of his beers and telling him in his drunken stuper how he was abusing my mother. He's also now claiming I stole 200 dollars out of his wallet but that's just a cherry on top.

Love my friend to death, I know she didn't mean it, but I took it too far when I poked fun back. I called her by her other black coworkers' name.

Right now, I share an apartment with two of them and an old friend from high school (who I'll call Sarah). While Sarah and I get along, our relationship feels just like a roommate relationship and not a close friendship. I hang out with my other four friends outside of classes and feel much closer to them.

Recently, one of my friends talked to Sarah about her living plans for next year, and Sarah just assumed we’d all continue living together. She mentioned she doesn't really have anyone else to live with, which is understandable, and she believes we’ll stay roommates. The problem is, my other friends and I aren’t keen on including Sarah in our plans because she’s caused issues, such as racking up our electric bill by using a lot of power and filling the apartment with smoke when she cooks due to frequently burning her food.

44,1gjkp9w,AITA for telling my mom that she is the reason I don't want to have kids?,"I (22F) have a rocky relationship with my mom. She was extremely mentally & emotionally abusive in my teenage years. We fought multiple times a day. I was under immense pressure to perform in tennis & my academics. I would be screamed at if my grades weren't perfect. I was berated for not trying hard enough, even after I was diagnosed with ADD, got meds, and straight A’s. She would also weigh me on a weekly basis and scold me when I gained weight, and she sent me to fat camp multiple times as a kid. She even made me be a camp counselor to “lose some weight before college” and refused to pick me up when everyone quit and I was left to run the camp by myself, I was only 19. Nothing I did was ever good enough. 

Freshman year of HS I had a new tennis coach. I was very close to my coach, and a year later he was shot & killed. His death hit me like a train- I felt that I had lost a crucial male figure in my life. My mom refused to let me miss any school bc ""high school is too important"". I became depressed & she accused me of being on drugs & threatened to drug test me. I was absolutely gutted by the lack of trust- I had never done any drugs or alcohol. She finally put me in group therapy at my school, but pulled me out shortly after when she realized I was being taken out of class for it. She told me that ""God took \[my coach\] away from me because I didn't appreciate him enough."" To this day I cannot go into a church without balling & thinking that God hates me & took away someone I cared so much about.

During our fights I would tell her that when I went to college I would cut communication off with her forever. My dad told me to write my mom a letter telling her how I felt & I wrote that I would never have kids because I didn’t want them around her. Since then she has been making a huge effort to mend our relationship & fix herself, and recently our relationship has been good. She still makes a few remarks here & there, and being with her in person leads to a few fights, but overall it is night & day.

My parents have been asking me when I am going to get married & have kids because they want to be grandparents. I haven't been in a relationship in over 3 years and I'm not seeing anyone. I told my mom that I don't think I want to have kids and she called me ""selfish"". She told me that her & my dad are gutted that I would deprive them of being grandparents and said it's ""not fair"" that I am still punishing her for her past mistakes. She also asked me how I expect to find a husband if I don't want to have children. Although I initially said those things to hurt my mom, I really don't know if I want to have kids. I know that she has made a real effort and change to fix our relationship, but I still hold some resentment towards her from the past.

 I've been to a couple of cons before this, the first one was me and my family, the second was me, my mum, and my friend. My mum also really likes to cosplay and has her own one. I love that I have a mum who shares my interests and I feel really lucky.

 But the second time I went to a con and she found out my friend was coming she felt kinda disappointed bc she wanted to spend time with me. I can understand that, I'd probably feel the same in her situation. But I was really excited as I'd only been to one con before and it was quite small and I'd never been to a con with a friend before. 

Me and my mum have recently been planning another con next year. I really wanted my friend to come too. Me and her were planning on going as Allen and Rilliane, they're from evillious chronicles for anyone who doesn't know, and I was pretty excited as we'd be staying overnight in a hotel. But once again, my mum was disappointed that it wouldn't be just us. And she made that pretty obvious.

 So now I feel really guilty about this. But Idk if this is my fault for not spending any time with my mum and I should just go without my friend, or it's her overreacting. I was considering maybe just going to another con with just her? Like, it's just that my friend is important to me and I love spending time with her.

47,1gjifav,AITA For Calling Out a Lie,"Backstory; Years ago one of my two best friends (we'll call them Riley) who I had known for a decade was diagnosed with cancer. This had horrible effects on their life and ability to muster the energy to do much. It was a terrible time for them and throughout it I and the other best friend (we'll call them Asher) tried our best to support them. One of the things we did to offer this support was ensure generous timing with schedules so that schedules were malleable enough for Riley to be included.



Fast forward a couple years and Riley was amazingly in remission and had really put in the effort and gotten their life back together. The whole schedule thing just got awful though. It all came to a head when one day while trying to work with this wild schedule Riley had told me that ""im also dating again and that takes up a good chunk of time too"". This rubbed both Asher and I the wrong way, as we felt that we as Riley's friends were being ghosted and our time wasted not because Riley couldn't help their circumstances but instead because they were actively putting us on the back burner for their new dating partner.



Asher and I brought up our grievances to Riley and it did not go well. They denied putting us on the back burner, said it really was their current circumstance dealing with stuff that had them, and expressed surprise as Asher and I explained that when we plan for things and Riley shows up late that they have wasted and disrespected our time. When I showed them their own quote about dating again taking up lots of time, they doubled down and Riley was so upset they left the conversation.



All that leads to the actual 'lie' from the title. After the previous disagreement Riley and I had a one on one conversation. Riley was convinced that Asher and I were only hounding them because they were dating, so I brought up that the exact situation of Riley scheduling something, ghosting me, lying about it, then getting angry about being called out has happened before. To which on the subject of the more recent conflict they replied; ""I didnt even think thatd have been a problem or think much of it until you blew it all up in my face... I guesss I lied? but in the most nonmalicious innocent sense of that word that anyone else wouldn't have even cared about or went as far as to make me feel so shitty about."" 



I remember experiencing a bit of an emotional shock at Riley going back on the entire ""denied putting us on the back burner"" and ""said it really was their current circumstance dealing with stuff that had them"" thing. The conclusion Riley reached was that I was the asshole for calling the lie out and making her feel shitty about it. This lead to us parting ways.

48,1gjho5c,AITA for Setting Boundaries with My Mom?,"I, a 34-year-old woman, recently set boundaries with my mother, Deb, regarding her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Ted, and it did not go well. For context, Ted has been in my mother’s life for nearly a decade. When I first met him, I found his behavior disrespectful; he frequently belittled her, and while I tolerated his presence for her sake, I made it clear that I wouldn’t invite him to family events. My mother often forgot this boundary, inviting him anyway, including during significant family moments.
My son, now 5, used to spend time with them both, but about a year ago, he expressed discomfort with Ted, stating that Ted tickled him when he didn’t want to be touched. As consent is crucial to my husband and me, I informed my mother that Ted would no longer be welcome in my son’s life. A few months later, my son wanted to see them again, so I reluctantly allowed it, hoping for the best.
After my daughter was born, my mother unexpectedly proposed that we buy land so she could live near us in a tiny home. I thought it was a strange suggestion but didn’t pursue it further. In August, while at their house, my son reacted negatively when he learned Ted was coming over, saying, “I don’t like Ted.” He described Ted’s unwanted physical affection and mentioned he’d told Ted to stop, but Ted persisted. Seeing my son's discomfort, I realized Ted wasn’t respecting his boundaries.
I planned to discuss my boundaries with my mother in person but delayed due to my father’s sudden death. During that time, my mother mentioned she viewed Ted as a roommate and prioritized her relationship with me over him. This gave me hope for an easier conversation.
Recently, we met for lunch, unaware that Ted would join. My husband struggled to tolerate him, but we got through it. The next day, my mother brought groceries and I reminded her that she was invited to my son’s upcoming birthday party—without Ted. This sparked anger in her. She called me petty and accused my husband of disrespecting her, which was news to me. I explained my reasons for excluding Ted, emphasizing my son’s well-being, but she insinuated he was making things up, claiming he was influenced by our feelings toward her partner.
She then mentioned she and Ted might be getting engaged, which surprised me. Our conversation escalated, with her criticizing my marriage and parenting. Ultimately, I reaffirmed my boundaries: Ted is not welcome in our family dynamic. I plan to communicate this directly to him and said I might reassess if he shows respect for my son’s boundaries in the future. My mother remains angry, even with this compromise.

49,1gjgxmk,AITA for snapping at my husband?,"Soo my husband on the whole it great! We have 2 kids and he's a great dad. 
I'm a SAHM, discussed and agreed , his job can be stressful, he deals with lots of big events and lots of people management, at times it can be overwhelming. 

I've noticed that whenever things are hard in work with events coming up or he's struggling with peoples mistakes etc. he's just not as nice as home. 
To a certain degree im ok with this. I cant expect him to be nice and happy all the time. I support him in anyway I can. 

The main reason I snapped today was because he shouted at my 2yo. We have a system with discipline, we say no, warn him, and then get down on his level and sternly talk to him. Then it's naughty step and a potential shouting depending on the situation. 
Almost every time the job is stressful, this goes out the window with hubs. He just defaults to shouting straight away. 

My LO was super upset, he loves his dad ( further proof he's normally an awesome dad) 
I whispered to him, I think you shouted too soon. (We've agreed not to disagree with discipline in front of the children but back each other up) Well this time I just didn't want to keep my mouth shut 
Well hubs shouted at me that I shouldn't undermine him in front of our child. 

I snapped back, I said I was done with how he treats us when he stressed, we are not the bad guys and he cannot take his frustrations out on us, I told him to get out and leave us alone. he left for work then and we've not spoken since 

I've been for coffee with a friend and she thinks I was too harsh and that I should cut him some slack as he's in a stressful place with work. I'll admit I shouldn't have said about not shouting, as I went back on something we agreed on. I just hated seeing my LO cry because of it. I want to protect him. 

I don't really know how to handle the situation otherwise. I have spoken to hubs about this issue before and he always apologises and says he'll work on it. But I'm not seeing any change and don't know how to help this issue... But I won't have him taking work stress out on us as a family...


Edit to update: I'm grateful for all the practical advice, thanks! Just for info this was before work so the chilling out post work advice, (although super helpful for other situations!) wouldn't work here. It was his anticipation of work. But perhaps I can just say I'll deal with discipline before work most times. ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-04,"AITA for snapping at my husband? Soo my husband on the whole it great!

50,1gjgwzp,AITA for not sharing the answers to my math homework?,"Ok, so, this kid (15M) I really dislike asked me (16F), on his friend's (15F) behalf, for the answers to our pre-calc homework. I'm not in class with the guy but his friend is, but I'm 'closer' to the guy (we're supposedly friends but I'm lowkey kinda fake about it trust if you knew him you'd be the same) so they asked me instead. 
Though, the kicker is, someone (15F) who is a lot closer to the guy (and is also my friend to be frank) is also in our class so I don't understand why he wouldn't just ask her. I guess I'm known as a ""smart kid"" but don't the smart ones stereotypically NOT give HW answers? He thought I was just chill like that idk. I fear he overestimated how much I value our 'friendship' (sorry). I personally don't give HW answers to people I'm not close to because I don't know if they'll straight up plagarize or just send in the same PDF as I did. I usually frown upon academic dishonesty but if it's nothing major I could care less. Just to help someone out yk? 
So, anyways, I didn't want to let my hate for 15M get in the way of helping the girl out, so I might've lied and settled for a healthy medium. I said I was hesitant to share because of ""middle school trauma"" (big fat lie, my pants are currently on fire) and then refrained from sending in the PDF of my HW and instead sent a handwritten explanation of how to solve each problem. Seemed sufficient to me! Apparently not. I got a text the next morning asking for the actual answers. And I may have deliberately waited until the HW's due date to respond, and it was too late by then. Whoops.
I think I might be the AH because I lied and left her on delivered, or maybe she might actually be going through something that limits her ability to complete the HW, but then again just email our teacher? He's a nice guy! Also the unspoken rule of students helping each other out. I don't wanna be like, 'stingy'. Idk. Did I let my hating get in the way? Help! I feel bad! But also not really.

51,1gjgp4t,AITA: kicking my brother in law out,"Back story: 5 months ago, my BIL (47) moved in with my wife (his sister) because he had no place to go, no money, no backup and no friends that would help him out. He was living in his own apartment because him and his wife were terrible for each other 25 years, cheated on each other constantly and were verbally and emotionally abusive to each other. They separated partially because their marriage was a shit show and he had an on-going affair. He has 3 kids; 22, 19, and 12. 

His plan was to run away with this mistress to where we live so he could have some family nearby and start over. His mistress was going to fund this whole ordeal but backed at the 11th hour, leaving him with nothing. At this point he had nothing. My wife and I decided he could come and stay with us until he got back on his feet, mentally and financially.

The only way to do that though was to send him gas money for the whole trip because he said he was broke and had less than $100 to his name. We told him prior to him heading this direction that he would need to pay rent ($400/mo), keep the room he stays in clean and take care of the 2 dogs he was bringing with him. (Side note: my wife and I already have 6 dogs so the extra puppers were not an issue.)

We were arguing about him because 2 days ago, he got up to go somewhere and when he got home to take his dogs out he screamed so loud at them and with so many profanities that our neighbor called my wife to see if her and our son were ok. Our neighbor thought I was doing something to them in a way that was so loud from a concrete basement, she called to check. After he took his dogs out, I said ""hey man, you can't scream like that, our neighbor called because she thought something bad was happening,"" and instead of realizing his mistake, he said he was tired of the lectures, started crying and then went back to his room in the basement. He didn't come out for more than 24 hours. He went to work last night and my wife wanted to check his room after he left.

She walked in and the smell was horrific, trash everywhere, clothes spilling out of the closet like a hoarder, just absolutely unacceptable. He had plastic fountain cups of his urine everywhere, some with lids and some without. He had also urinated in one of our dishes that we use for drinking. We found some of our dishes in trash bags that also had dog shit in them. It was one of the most disgusting things I've ever been a witness to and I've seen a lot of terrible shit.

So my wife and I have decided that he has to go as soon as he gets a full paycheck. Although we're not sure how to tell him because of how unstable he is. We plan on speaking with the police because I don't want him to hurt us, destroy our stuff anymore than he already has or hurt his dogs out of anger. I feel like an asshole for not listening to my wife about what kind of person he was.

Once she makes a new friend she'd act she she was better then me and be more distant but after a while she'd got board with them and ended up always coming back excepting everything to be the same,and most of the time it was cause I did really enjoy taking her.

For context we bothered indain this past week me,rose and our other friends performed for diwail.Through out the whole process of choreographing, practicing and doing dress rehearsals,she complained to me about all her problems which was fine cause she was really stressed so it's understandable and somehow that was the most we talked one on one in a while,and that really did make me happy.

 The event came and we did out performance and it went fine but after one of roses friends(Emily) walked in.

I ask her ""what that's supposed to mean?"" And she just keeps going on about how she doesn't like Maggie.

so my roommate invites me to this and says your boyfriend is welcome to come but just warning you that friend group is invited so she doesn’t know if it’ll be awkward. i agreed and told my boyfriend this. i kind of implied that he shouldn’t be there. she also tells me she didn’t invite my ex but she’s not gonna tell him he’s not allowed so there might be a possibility he would show up at some point. i told my boyfriend that i would throw her in the fountain and come straight back to him after. i got there and my roommate was begging me to go out with her to the club after and truthfully i kinda wanted to go. my boyfriend voiced his concerns and said this was crossing a line and it made him uncomfortable. 

i was having a good time with these friends who i missed a lot and i knew this was gonna be my only opportunity to see them.

55,1gjfwcq,AITA For procrastinating my chore?,"I (21 f) and my boyfriend (23) have been arguing a lot recently. It seems to be the same argument over and over. I am always the one in the wrong because I am “being a selfish brat and cunt because I am intentionally talking back to get on his bad side”. 

This one started Sunday night when he was going to make him some food. He saw that he needed a dish that was dirty in the sink, and his only chore is dishes, he went ahead and washed them all.

My only designated chore is laundry. So I made sure he had all the clothes he needed for work the next day and said I would do the rest tomorrow (my 2nd day off). the basket was full so I would have to do 2 loads but it wasn’t an overwhelming amount. 

CONTEXT: 
Our house, I do all the cooking and most of the cleaning unless I ask for help, he usually agrees to. We have 2 dogs so the house needs a good dusting and vacuuming pretty often. 

I work Tues-Sat and he works the typical work week. I work 50 hours, he works 40. 

I’m the head kitchen manager and have a lot of responsibilities. I do prep, cook, and make plates. There is rarely a time in the 10hr days that I’m not on my feet. It also doesn’t help that we are understaffed. 

Friday night he decided to have his brother and sister in law over to the house. It rolled around to be 1 am and I knew I had to be up at 5am so I went to go to bed. I don’t blame my boyfriend or his brother because they don’t hang out much, but they kept waking me up. the planned 4 hrs of sleep turned into 3. I come home exhausted and I crashed.

It is a mutual agreement that Sundays are the chill around the house day. 

I typically use Monday to catch up on laundry and do some cleaning around the house. Some Mondays he leaves dishes for me to do and I’ll go ahead and wash them for him. Monday  is my productive day. 

ARGUMENT:
He is doing his dishes when he strongly suggests I get up and go do laundry when he is doing dishes. I state that I made sure he has clothes ready for him tomorrow and that I would finish it all the next day.

He says that there is no real reason not to do it right now, which is a valid point but I say Saturday is my one day to truly relax and do nothing. My one day to not worry about cooking, cleaning, or work as it sometimes demands me to do work from home. 

He seems adamant on me starting my chores when he’s doing his so I begrudgingly go start folding. After he gets done with his dishes, he sees me folding and starts to criticize why I didn’t start the laundry and begin folding first. 

Anyway, it turns into this whole argument about how I always talk back and never want to be on his side. He starts yelling about how I am a lazy piece of shit and why would I want to project myself as lazy to him? I can never be on his side and he always has to argue stupid shit to me. I admit I was being lazy. But everyone can be lazy sometimes.

It seems to be the same argument over and over. I am always the one in the wrong because I am “being a selfish brat and cunt because I am intentionally talking back to get on his bad side”. 

This one started Sunday night when he was going to make him some food. He saw that he needed a dish that was dirty in the sink, and his only chore is dishes, he went ahead and washed them all.

My only designated chore is laundry. So I made sure he had all the clothes he needed for work the next day and said I would do the rest tomorrow (my 2nd day off). the basket was full so I would have to do 2 loads but it wasn’t an overwhelming amount. 

CONTEXT: 
Our house, I do all the cooking and most of the cleaning unless I ask for help, he usually agrees to. We have 2 dogs so the house needs a good dusting and vacuuming pretty often. 

I work Tues-Sat and he works the typical work week. I work 50 hours, he works 40. 

I’m the head kitchen manager and have a lot of responsibilities. I do prep, cook, and make plates. There is rarely a time in the 10hr days that I’m not on my feet. It also doesn’t help that we are understaffed. 

Friday night he decided to have his brother and sister in law over to the house. It rolled around to be 1 am and I knew I had to be up at 5am so I went to go to bed. I don’t blame my boyfriend or his brother because they don’t hang out much, but they kept waking me up. the planned 4 hrs of sleep turned into 3. I come home exhausted and I crashed.

It is a mutual agreement that Sundays are the chill around the house day. 

I typically use Monday to catch up on laundry and do some cleaning around the house. Some Mondays he leaves dishes for me to do and I’ll go ahead and wash them for him. Monday  is my productive day. 

ARGUMENT:
He is doing his dishes when he strongly suggests I get up and go do laundry when he is doing dishes. I state that I made sure he has clothes ready for him tomorrow and that I would finish it all the next day.

He says that there is no real reason not to do it right now, which is a valid point but I say Saturday is my one day to truly relax and do nothing. My one day to not worry about cooking, cleaning, or work as it sometimes demands me to do work from home. 

He seems adamant on me starting my chores when he’s doing his so I begrudgingly go start folding. After he gets done with his dishes, he sees me folding and starts to criticize why I didn’t start the laundry and begin folding first. 

Anyway, it turns into this whole argument about how I always talk back and never want to be on his side. He starts yelling about how I am a lazy piece of shit and why would I want to project myself as lazy to him? I can never be on his side and he always has to argue stupid shit to me. I admit I was being lazy. But everyone can be lazy sometimes.

This week has been really rough at work, and I asked him to go out for food, saying I needed a pick-me-up. I mentioned I wasn't super hungry since I had already eaten, but I was really looking forward to having some dumplings and soup—I even talked about how excited I was for the dumplings during the drive there.

When we ordered, I made it clear that I only wanted four dumplings and some soup. My boyfriend ordered two large mains for himself since he has a bigger appetite. When the food arrived, I shared my soup with him and tasted a bite of his food, but I was mostly focused on my dumplings.

When my dumplings came, I ate one before I needed to run to the bathroom. When I got back, he had eaten both of the remaining dumplings! I was really upset because I had been looking forward to them and only got to eat one. I told him how disappointed I was and called him selfish, saying he never thinks of me.

AITA for dodging my mother’s calls while she is still in hospital recovering from open heart surgery?

I (52F) have a long-time dysfunctional relationship with my mom (74F). We had a not bad relationship until she left my father and soon after moved in with her boyfriend “Fred” (40sM). My younger brother and I moved in with them as well in a town an hour away from where I grew up.

The dynamic was weird. For my 18th birthday she (they?) gave me a “sexy” lace teddy!?! I was quiet, a bookworm and kept to myself at home. A few months after my 18th birthday, I was going camping with a youth group and decided to walk to the pickup point instead of asking Fred for a drive since he was too drunk to drive IMHO.  (Note- earlier to this, my younger brother had been kicked out because he wanted to see his friends in our home town).
When I got home, I was told I was too disrespectful for not asking for a ride and they kicked me out. I could not go back to my father as one of his friends had been SA me for years and I was not willing to go back. And my relationship with my father was not the best since he was the disciplinarian in the family and a little too violent with his discipline.
Thankfully, one of the leaders of the youth group had an empty apartment above his business and he let me move in rent free. Otherwise, I would have had to couch surf or live on the streets. I was still in school and had to work to get food on the table.

I did not cut ties with my mom as I was still in the “she is my mom I have to love her” mode. What eventually made me go low contact was how she treated my relationship with my now husband. When his family found out my situation, they let me move in with them (11 hours away). I think she got offended they were treating me better than she did, and she never really supported our relationship. When I took the bus up to visit and tell her I was engaged, she didn’t want to spend time just us, she wanted to drag me to the bars with her cronies. When I said that didn’t interest me, she got very bitter. When the wedding came, she made one BS reason after the other on why she couldn’t attend (her mom and sisters did and offered a room, transportation. We got married where we met, which was a 4-hour drive for her, and a 9-hour drive for us. One of her sisters flew in from what would have been a 21-hour drive. Of course, she made it to all 3 of my  brothers’ weddings (and 2 of my brothers have been married multiple times – she went to all those weddings).

Since then, I have not initiated contact. She calls on most birthday and Christmas, but never anniversary. Until she got FB, she never even acknowledged her two grandchildren by us. Not even a card. And she never acknowledged the pain she caused even when I was forced to see her at her mom’s funeral. It still hurts that she refused to go to her only daughter’s wedding.

Now a few weeks ago, she had a heart attack and ended up in ICU needing a bypass. They flew her to a big city where one of my kids happens to live. We have let both kids have whatever relationship they want with her, but she literally has never met this one. She has been calling every night except when she was too sleepy from the surgery. The last two nights I have screened her calls.

I have had quite a few hospital stays, including Covid, emergency spinal surgery and heart issues. She has not once sent a card or phoned, let alone even made much of an acknowledgment on FB whenever these have happened.

AITA for not having the emotional band width to do any more small talk supporting my mom who has not really supported me for 34 years?

TL;DR My mom is in the hospital and I have been ignoring her latest calls after being LC since she refused to come to my wedding.

59,1gjexbk,AITA for refusing to do household chores during the week and only doing them on the weekend?,"...............
Hi, my name is Jenifer. I'm a 22-year-old woman. I live with my mom and two siblings (16 and 20 years old). I work in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon, and I go to college in the evening. Currently, I’m taking seven courses and doing two internships, along with my job, which takes up a lot of my time. I live far from the university, so I need to take two buses to get there. My sister (16) is in her last year of high school, and my brother (20) dropped out of college and works at a pizzeria. My mom assigns most of the household chores to me, maybe because I’m older or wake up earlier (since I work at the university and it’s far away). Sometimes she leaves voice messages saying things like:

""Even if you don’t have time, do this or do that.""

She says this as if I had nothing else to do or as if I were the only one living with her. In the past, I had trouble saying “no,” but nowadays it’s much easier for me. So, whenever I have a busy day, which happens most of the time, I can’t do anything at home. The college offers meals for one real (I live in Brazil), so it’s very cheap, and I have lunch and dinner there since I study at night. When I get home, around 11 pm, I just shower and sleep. I only have time to do chores on weekends. Even though my mom knows my routine, she still asks me to do most of the things at home, which makes me upset, as if she ignores my studies, work, and the fact that I get tired too.

My sister studies in the morning, and my brother wakes up only between 11 am and 12 pm. He works until 1 am, so it’s understandable. But it’s not every day that he works. Recently, I found out (waking up at night to go to the bathroom) that my brother stays on his phone until 4 or 5 am, which is why he wakes up later the next day. Anyway… he doesn’t do any chores at home, always using the excuse that he’s going to be late for work (which starts at 6 pm and is only two streets away from our house).

Back to my mom: she gets really upset when I get home early, around 7 or 8 pm, and just have dinner or sleep, because, I imagine, she thinks I could do something at that time and that I’m not tired. But she has always done this; she always assigned me more tasks, even when I was a full-time student in high school and only got home at 9 pm (I was a teenager).

So, sometimes I refuse to do chores because I’m tired or need to leave very early in the morning, and she argues with me about it as if there weren’t other people in the house who have the time to do them. On the weekdays when I’m off, I do the chores without complaining (after all, I live here too), but I notice that my siblings don’t move to help, so I end up doing everything by myself, and the same thing happens the next day and so on.

So, I wanted to ask: am I being unreasonable for refusing to do chores when I have such a heavy routine?

Please leave your opinions on how I can improve this and if I should be more productive at home. Hugs from Brazil to everyone ♥️♥️

Instead, he’s taken it upon himself to negotiate with the investors, even going so far as to tell me what I should accept and trying to convince me it’s a good deal.

My MIL ( 57) works on weekends for a few hours at most 
I do most of the cooking and clean our shared place as well as some common areas, if I see something could use some cleaning I'll do it except my MIL bedroom
That is not to say that his mom doesn't clean considering she s at home most of the time, but I'd say it s a good 65-35% between us 
Now onto the issue, a few days ago my MIL approached me and asked if I was willing to accept a schedule on deep cleaning the bathrooms, my boyfriend overheard us and before I could even answer he said that u do enough already and I shouldn't be bothered with a schedule

63,1gje3xe,AITA for telling my mom not to invite a racist for Christmas ,"I (27f) and my best friend (27f) have known each other since we were little kids. At this point we’re more like sisters than friends. My friend, I’ll called her Jessica, grew up never liking sympathy.

She grew up with a brilliant single mom (let’s call her Alison). She always taught Jessica to never judge a person based on race, sexuality, etc. Last year, Jessica went through a really rough time: she lost her dream job and ended a 5 year relationship with her boyfriend (28m)

A few months later, she has a fling with this guy (23M) who we’ll call Greg. It started very casual. Greg didn’t want anything serious at all. He’d told friends Jessica was “too skinny” and “too much drama”. This stuff got back to Jessica and although it really upset her, they still would hook up because, again, nothing serious. 

Jessica told me about all his red flags: he had a son from a previous fling (she hates the idea of being a step mom) he was part of a dangerous motorbike gang and, worst of all, he had a real problem with black people. She refused to say in detail but it was stuff she was horrified by. Greg even announced that he didn’t care that he was a racist, even wore it proudly. I was shocked and said “surely, you won’t see him again” She explained that it was just sex and she’s told him she didn’t want to hear anymore racist stuff. She comforted me by saying it would likely fizzle out soon.

Suddenly just after Christmas last year, Alison died. She’s never been a healthy woman but it still felt sudden. With Alison gone, my parents and I were the closest to family Jessica had. As she had all of her life, she’d only accept comfort for a short amount of time. Still, I stayed with her that night. 

Alison wasn’t rich, but being the only family, Jessica was set to inherit a lot of money. Greg suddenly became very interested in having a serious relationship with her: talks of Greg being her boyfriend, of them getting pets together, of them moving in together. Short of having a full on argument, I’ve questioned Jessica as to why on earth she was getting serious with this racist. She’d argue that I didn’t know him like she did. It’s too convenient that this guy suddenly doesn’t mind the “drama” once she inherits a huge sum of money.

Traditionally, because it was just Jessica and Alison for years, they’d come for xmas dinner at my parent’s house. My mom decided this year, despite my mistrust and dislike of Greg, to invite him to Xmas. I still have never met him and he’s coming on Xmas? I told my mom how against the idea I was. I’ve been losing Sleep worrying and I ended up in tears at how messed up the whole situation seems. How I feel alone in seeing how this guy is preying on my grieving friend. My mom said he’d uninvite him months ago but a conversation with Jessica the other week proves she never did

I feel almost gaslit at this point. Greg is clearly not a good man and we all have to just accept this isn’t messed up.

64,1gje2i5,AITA for 'lacking emotional intelligence' ,"Me and my friends (all M19) were sitting around and talking as we do any time we're free together. As our discussion continued, one of my friends remarked that he saw a new pizza place open in our city called Susan (fake name)'s pizza. Susan is the name of my friend's ex. 

Our friend group has been tightly knit for years now so we know a lot about each others lives and make jokes about exes or crushes a lot, so I make a joke about ""well we can't invite \[friend\] to a hang out there"". It was light hearted and I didn't mean anything by it. My friend responded with a joke of his own about a girl I used to like, and so we kind of just had a back and forth until he snapped and got angry at me, saying something like ""yeah you know that emotional intelligence you have? maybe you should use it.""

After he said that, the vibe quickly soured and we all kind of just went quiet. He sort of distanced himself and the rest of us continued talking about something else until it was time to go. It feels like there's a wall between us now and I really can not stand the suffocating atmosphere. 

Here's the thing. I have a very hard time recognizing emotions through implication, tone, body language, or other social cues. This is something that I've communicated to them and is a major insecurity of mine. I would've much rather preferred he just say 'hey man, can you not?' instead of up the ante and then explode. Instead he decided to belittle me and make fun of an insecurity of mine.

From my perspective, it's as if you came up to someone who had a weak sense of smell but smelled bad and snapped at them for it, then said ""you know that sense of smell you have? use it"", when you know their sense of smell is weak and that it's an insecurity of theirs. 

I get that my social ineptitude isn't his problem, but it is if we're friends and I've made it clear that if I'm crossing the line, I really can't just 'tell' I am based off cues, I need to be told I am with proper communication.

65,1gjdtgd,"WIBTA for buying a fridge and refusing to let my roommate and his girlfriend use it, even though they’d have no other way to keep their food fresh?","
I (26M) live with my roommate (33M), who is also my coworker. We initially moved in together to share the cost of rent and groceries, and we were planning to buy a fridge together. However, since his girlfriend (28F) moved in about five months later, the dynamic has changed significantly, and that discussion was forgotten.

Now, we each buy our own groceries and kitchen supplies, including separate toiletries and even toilet paper. It feels like I’m a third wheel in my own home, and I no longer have the convenience of sharing space with my roommate. I was hoping to create a communal living environment, but instead, it has turned into separate lives.

Currently, I don’t have a fridge, and I’m considering buying one, especially since holiday sales are coming up. However, my roommate is unwilling to contribute to the cost, and I’m worried about sharing it with them since they seem to want everything separate now. 

When we both get home from work, his girlfriend is usually in the kitchen cooking, and I have to wait an hour or two to use the space. I’ve suggested she cook earlier so that I can have time in the kitchen too, but my roommate prefers not to eat cold food. This situation has led to me frequently getting takeout, which is wasteful and affects my groceries since my fresh food often goes bad.

The bathroom situation is also frustrating. I handle cleaning it properly, using detergent and bleach, while they only mop with water. If the cleaning supplies run out, I end up replacing them, even if it means living with a dirty bathroom until I can afford more. This makes me concerned about how they would clean a fridge if I were to share one with them, especially since their version of cleaning the kitchen is just doing the dishes and putting them away.

I’ve attempted to discuss house rules and boundaries with my roommate, but he believes we should just mind our own business as long as the rent is paid. I don’t feel comfortable addressing his girlfriend directly, as I’ve noticed my roommate tends to side with her in conflicts. This has made it awkward for me to try to assert my needs.

My coworkers have said I would be the AH if I bought a fridge and didn’t share it with them, which adds to my confusion about what the right thing to do is. 

Considering all of this, I’m contemplating buying my own fridge. AITA for wanting to do that and not share it with them, given that they seem to want everything separate?


Edit to answer most of the questions in the comments.

The apartment was unfurnished and did not come with appliances. So my landlord agreed to reduce the rent and also covers utilities. Only thing we pay is rent which is split 2 ways, and repair and maintenance for any minor damages or upkeep. 

Gf is not on the lease. It's been 15 months since I moved in. She's been living with us for about 10 months now.

Trust me I'm looking for another place but currently it's out of my budget at the moment to rent by myself long term. With the options I have, I'd either have to pay more in rent or pay the same plus utilities, which I can maybe afford but only for a few months.",Not enough info,2024-11-04,"WIBTA for buying a fridge and refusing to let my roommate and his girlfriend use it, even though they’d have no other way to keep their food fresh?

67,1gjd8zu,AITA for accepting cash gifts from mum when my fiancé is loaded af,"I (29m) have a corporate girl fiancé (31f). Very hardworking, ambitious, super smart, and has an MBA so it’s not very surprising that she is climbing that corporate ladder like King Kong climbs the Empire State. She is now the Marketing Director of a company that boomed during the pandemic. More to this later.

Whereas here I am, lost and directionless at 29 working a nightfill position at a local supermarket. We met in 2017, at a time when she was very undercompensated from an old job until she moved to her current job in 2020.

Now my family knows she kind of fit the Asian overachiever stereotype (her words) and they know she works in Marketing for a big brand. But I guess they never expected her to be rich rich (income-wise). We live together and I am proud of myself for not being a mooch. However, my total income goes to bills, going out expenses, and the occasional flowers and gifts. I pull in 1k a week after tax which is livable and some in today’s economy. Absolutely no room for savings but we are at a point in our relationship where I know she’s got me if I do need money (she has verbally expressed this countless of times).

We also share the same values when it comes to money which is we’re not show offs. We even share one car (she works from home most of the time now), a 2022 Toyota Kluger. We eat whatever we want to eat and we rent in a good part of town (house will be built after we get married). That’s probably our biggest chunk of our expenses but we (she) don’t shop much. 

Now this is where I might be AITA. My family is poor — all three of us kids didn’t go to college, we lived in government housing at some point in our childhood, etc. you get the drift. My sister works as a mechanic and my brother works in a fast food joint. Now mum was involved in something two years ago and won a lawsuit and got a couple of million as a settlement. Since then, she bought a house and promised to help us out. She’s given us each (her kids) $20,000 (February 2023), then $10,000 (July 2023), $5000 (April 2024) and another $5,000 two weeks ago. Majority of the money she gave, I contributed to me and my partner’s vacations and household expenses/purchases. My brother moved in with my mum and keeps her company in her new house.


Yesterday we all had dinner at mum’s. Since my brother lived there, he showed me his new $2,500 computer and he seemed really stoked. My gaming laptop conks out here and there due to overheating so my brother teased me to get a new one as well since he knows I just got money from mum too.

When we were at the dinner table, my brother said something about me getting a new computer again and without thinking, I turned to my partner and joked and said, “well now you know what you can get me for Christmas.” 

I can’t remember who spoke first but my brother and sister both said I can afford it so no need to ask for such an expensive gift. My idiot brain decided to reply with, “my fiancé earns $40k a month, $2k is nothing to her.” As soon as I said it, the table went silent and I felt my fiance froze. My sister broke the silence and was very much WTF and asked if it’s true. My poor fiance does not know how to lie and was prodded to give more details about her personal finances. I tried to change subjects but no one was letting it drop. She basically had to explain that she earns an obscene $850k annually. Basically in the last four years, the company that she works for has grown 300% due to her direct efforts hence getting the pay bumps. She is basically attached to the hip with the owner. So in the last few years, I kid you not — she jumped from $180k to $300k to $600k base pay then bonuses that can make her total annual up to 850k (which is what she got in 2023 and looking good to net that as well this year). It’s a very new income level for her so it’s not like she’s a multi millionaire (yet).

And to defend myself, we have given expensive gifts to each other before. She has given me a PS5, really expensive leather boots, etc. and I have given her an iPad Pro, Apple Watch, and more so it’s not too impossible to be gifted something in the thousands. It’s not like that all the time and we take delight even with simple gifts. For my last birthday, she got me a funny shirt that I love that probably cost $15.

My brother and sister pulled me aside after dinner and said I was the greediest person they’ve ever met for accepting mum’s cash gifts when my partner is so loaded. I said to them her money is not my money and we’re saving up for a wedding and a house so mum’s gifts are helping. I had to explain I want to try and make it a 50-50 contribution even at least for the wedding. They countered by saying it’s not really logical since technically it’s mum’s contribution then and not mine. I stood my ground that I’m not well off and our mum should treat us all equally.


I also got a text from my mum this morning saying she’s Switzerland. But her staying neutral is making me question if I really did something wrong?

70,1gjc9pm,AITA for making a woman lose a costume contest?,"So I am the events chair of my fraternity for the semester and I planned out a Halloween party that happened yesterday.

At the party we typically have a huge costume contest. You pay 5 dollars to enter and if you win, you win the pot. We usually pull about 30 to 50 entries. So the prize is pretty nice. This year we had 40 people enter and about 160 people attending. 

In years past, the winner has been this one specific chick That my brothers wanna fuck. Her costume is usually the typical sorority girl costume (an animal of some kind, boots, fishnet leggings, a short skirt, basically a bra or corset, and then animal ears and light face paint). 

Now I’m not a Halloween nazi. This year my costume was literally just a angel wings, and white shorts, and a halo. I know fully that I’m dressing up so hot guys that think I’m hot will take notice and that it’s not a “good costume”. Her costume isn’t good. Sure, she looks good in it. But the point of the party is who has the best breasts

So we have the contest, and she’s wearing her MO. She was a bee, but her ass was hanging out and her boobs were about to fall out of her shirt. So we held the contest, people voted anonymously, and guess what. She won. But by one vote. I hadn’t voted yet, so I simply casted my vote then my vice chairman, who agreed with me casted his vote. That just happened to be enough to put her at second place. 

When I told my by brothers they bitched and moaned about it, but I told them she simply didn’t win and she should do better next year. They eventually talked me into creating a runner up prize of 50 dollars to the girl.

When we announced the winner, she was visibly upset. This was the first time she hasn’t won in the last 4 years. Now apparently, last night one of my brothers was simping hard and told her that I intentionally voted against her because I didn’t like her (not true, I’m genuinely apathetic about her).

She found me later that night and cursed me out and said I had a problem with her. I told her simply that we weren’t having a sluttiest costume contest, but a best costume contest and that she’s lucky we bent the rules to give her 50 bucks. We argued and ended up getting separated.

Now a lot of my brothers are pissed at me for pissing her off.

My youngest sister is 6 months pregnant and I just found out about the baby. Yes, you read that correctly. She just told me, my other sister and my parents about her pregnancy, meanwhile the baby daddy’s family has known as long as she has known. 

My feelings are extremely hurt, seeing as I talk to her almost everyday. Granted, she lives two and a half hours away and I haven’t seen her in person for almost a year and half, I still feel like this is something that she should have filled my other sister and I in on. 

The baby daddy’s sister is planning a baby shower but has failed to reach out to anyone on my side of the family. My other sister feels it’s her’s and I’d responsibility to throw a shower, which I agree. But when we approached the pregnant lady about wanting to throw her a shower for at least our family, she acted uninterested in the idea. 

I sat and thought about it for a day and realized there is so much that goes into a baby shower, logistically, emotionally and financially. With her due date in late January, the only realistic time to have it is in mid November, which is now. But we have nothing. No venue, no decor, no food, no theme. Nothing. 

Since I’ve voiced my opinions on all of this to both of my sisters, they’ve turned cold and bitter to me, saying how I just don’t want to find time or the funds for this baby shower. Which is very untrue, I’m just trying to be realistic on the whole matter. 

I love both of my sisters to death and I would do anything for them, I just don’t know how it’s possible to plan an event this large when I work 80 hour weeks and my other sister works a night shift. 

As far as doing a joint shower with his side of the family, my pregnant sister refuses to entertain that idea, saying there’s a language barrier and other nonsense.

73,1gjbmio,AITA for picking a 'disrespectful name'?,"I (18m) am transgender.  
I first came out to my parents 4 years ago, and realised that I'm trans a few months earlier, when I was 13. My parents did not take that well at all. They claimed everything to be a phase, that I'm confused, or that I have some other unresolved issues that cause me to think this.

About two years ago I told my parents that I've picked a name (I'd been using a 'placeholder name' for over 2 years until that point). The name is based on the second name that they gave me when I was born, which is after my grandmother. My current name is the closest masculine version of that after 1 other version which I hate. 

Yesterday, my parents found out that my second chosen name is a male version of my 'original' first name that pretty much sounds the same (think noa/noah). My parents hated it, which I find understandable since they've been struggling from the beginning with me changing my name at all. I specifically picked my name, both first and second, because I wanted to respect my parents and not stray too far from my birth name so that they'd find this pill slightly easier to swallow.

My dad said that I'm extremely disrespectful to make a mockery of their choice like that, and that not consulting with them makes it so much worse. He said that since I only ever think about myself, walk all over their choices, and hurt them all the time, I shouldn't have made a mockery of the name they took effort in picking for me and should just stay with my first name. My mom was also very offended for not asking them beforehand, but they've never so much as called me by my name, even the first name which I thought they were more-or-less fine with? Why would I ask the people who refuse to have the conversation or admit that I'm trans every time I try to bring it up in any way?

77,1gj9ozw,AITA for demanding my roommate replaces an item she says she didn't break? ,"I have to share my room with a girl and we have an arrangement where our storage space is basically split in half (let's say left half of the shelf is hers, right one is mine, as it corresponds to the side our beds are placed). The girl is a complete stranger to me and from what I've gauged her financial situation is way way worse than mine (I can afford higher end items, meanwhile she's saving on everything there's possible to save on). I don't touch her stuff, she doesn't touch mine (or so I thought). Until.... I ran out of micelar water and replaced it with another bottle, which cost me 25€ (it's a big bottle). I placed it on my side of the shelf that was the opposite side to where our shelf meets in the middle (so I rule out her trying to reach for something that's on her side and accidentally knocking the bottle over). I barely got to use it, and a couple of days ago I came back to our room to find that bottle missing a cap. Like, it's broken off and the top is missing, which means that if you tilt the bottle, the product is pouring out with nothing to stop it. Keep in mind, the bottle is big, so I planned on using it for at least several months, therefore I'll have to bring that same bottle home somehow. I asked her to replace the bottle for me and she's insisting that she didn't touch it. I said that okay, then probably somebody you brought over (I have no clue if she did) broke it and could you please still replace it for me. She still claims she didn't break it, I must've broken it myself and can't afford to replace it. (There's no way I broke it and didn't notice, because the first thing I noticed when I glanced over the shelf was the cap being broken and missing, there's no way I broke it myself and just didn't notice, it would have been a massive 'oh shiiit' moment for me if it would have happened). 

So AITA for insisting she replaces a bottle that she says she didn't break and I know she can't afford? 



UPDATE: okay okay, I get it, I will not ask her to replace the bottle and as some of you advised, I will let her find someone nicer to live with, reverting to my previous accommodation agreement: will keep paying for a two people room alone and live here alone.

78,1gj9dqr,AITA For considering leaving the hospital after rushing my boyfriend to the ER,"I (20F) had to rush my boyfriend (21M) to the ER after he had a pretty bad fall while skateboarding. Because we're in Canada, our health care system can be pretty slow at times so getting looked at can take hours. I suffer from Nosocomephobia and Emetophobia (Fear of hospitals and fear of vomiting) and I have an anxiety disorder so I was already feeling pretty uncomfortable from the moment we got there. 

About two and a half hours in, I was starting to panic really bad. So much so that a nurse who had seen what was going on came over and offered my boyfriend and I our own room so I could have space to breathe. I agreed and the nurse lead us to our room. I was starting to feel better when not even 5 minutes after getting in that room, someone in the hallway started vomiting profusely. Like projectile vomit everywhere. I tried blocking out the sound with some music but even at full volume I could still hear it. My boyfriend was trying to calm me down but it was too late. I was full on breaking down. Tears were rolling down my face and all I wanted was to go home. In the moment I was unsure whether or not my thoughts were irrational, so I called up a couple of friends to ask their opinions. They all agreed that it would be really bad if I left so instead I ended up just stepping outside for 10 minutes and then going back in.

My boyfriend ended up being okay in the end and I managed to stay calm the rest of the time. I wish my story ended there but the next day I got a phone call from my friends (lets call them Peter and Jason). Peter and Jason spent an hour and a half chewing me out for my actions from the day before. To summarize, They had said that the fact that I had even thought about leaving was unforgivable and that I should apologize to my boyfriend for being so selfish. I felt genuinely bad about the whole thing so I called my boyfriend and apologized for everything. He told me that he was super confused as to why I was sorry and I explained to him what had been said to me. He said he thought it was rude of Peter and Jason to chew me out for something that he wasn't even upset about and that I had no reason to be sorry. 

This happened a month ago and some of my friends are still mad at me for it.

79,1gj9a66,"AITA for ""leaving the herd"" when trying shrooms with my friend and her girlfriend?","I (20F) made a friend (Amb, 26F) at college. She's a sweetheart and fun hang. We were gonna study/paint, and Amb had agreed to drive me home as long as my partner (Jay, 24M) dropped me off. Amb lives with her partner Alex (30F). 1 hour in Amb says she feels like doing shrooms. I've never had them before, but I'm down to try them. So we have shrooms around 6 PM. They said I could stay the night if I wanted to.



\~9:30, I'm tired and want to head home. I ask if it's okay if I want to sleep in my bed tonight, Amb says that makes sense. Alex says I need to ""stay with the herd"" since it's my first time, so I agree to stay a little longer and we paint. I text Jay to pick me up cause we live about 30 minutes away in good traffic.



10:15 Jay shows up. I tell my friends I'm gonna pack my stuff and go. Amb helps pack my things, but Alex says to bring him inside. Alex immediately offers him chocolate and he accepts. When she walked out to get it, I told him what was in it. Jay refuses. I go finish packing.



Alex followed me asking why Jay didn't want any chocolate. I said I told him that it had shrooms, but she said he I shouldn't be making decisions for him. She went to talk to him.



Amb came into the kitchen to ask if I was okay. I said I was worried about leaving. She said no one would be mad at me, and helps me pack, then Alex yells that I'm 20 and she just gave me shrooms, so if anything happens she's responsible. Jay says he can stay for a while to make sure I'm OK. Amb, Jay, and I agree I can leave at 2 AM. Alex says NO, I am staying the night. I say I want to sleep in my bed, and Alex asks if I'm autistic. I agree to stay till 2 AM, but I don't agree to stay the night. Alex says she can force me to stay because if I call the cops, ""who will they REALLY believe?""



I go quiet and sit on the couch with Jay. Alex paces back and forth between rooms. She says that I'm killing the vibe, and I need to go upstairs. I ask if I can leave. Amb says that Alex is right and it's a bad idea, so I can't leave. I ask if I have to go upstairs, she says yes, and so I get upset and say that I trusted her and she lied to me that I was free to go home. Amb starts saying she's sorry, but I really can't leave. Jay sees me starting to go catatonic, so he crouches in front of the couch and tries to comfort me.



Alex says that me and Jay are codependent and he needs to be a free spirit. He says I can leave if I want. He keeps comforting me and Alex shushes him. Jay looks over to ask if I'm ready to leave (yes). He helps me up off the couch and I grab my backpack/purse. Alex grabs his arm to try to get him to sit back down. He pulls his arm away and tells her NOT to touch us. Jay yells that she's been disrespecting me all night and I don't have to stay. Amb then grabs Alex's arm to pull her back as it turns into a screaming match.



I get my shoes, and they both turn to ask me what I want. I say I want to LEAVE. They try to stop me again, Jay yells for them to get away, and then we leave.

Three years ago, I told them I was getting married. Their issue wasn’t with me marrying young but that I had chosen my spouse instead of letting them arrange the marriage. I had always been the ""golden child,"" so this was hard for them to accept.

Since then, they’ve been emotionally abusive, constantly criticizing me, my husband (26M), and his family. They exclude my husband from family events, which is especially hurtful because he’s a kind and respectful man who doesn’t deserve this treatment.

Earlier this year, during a week-long visit for a religious holiday, my husband and I stayed at my parents' house. One morning, my husband slept in for 30 minutes past my mom's ""mandatory"" wake-up time because the maid needed to clean the room.

She didn’t like me defending him and was curt with me for the rest of the morning.

Later, as we were getting ready to leave the house, I noticed my mom standing outside our room. She questioned why the door was locked. I explained that my husband had just showered and didn’t want anyone walking in. This led to a massive argument. She yelled about how poorly my husband was raised, insulted his parents, and even admitted to taking pictures of our room, claiming it was messy.

I told her her behavior was unacceptable and reminded her of her past mistreatment. My husband, overhearing the argument, packed our bags and said we were leaving.

We current have no kids and are saving for a house and wedding, by doing this I earn roughly $20 more per hour over an 8hr shift. I personally would rather work more whilst we’re young and have little responsibility’s, however, my partner thinks I’m putting work and money over him as we now only have 1 day off together a week.

Afterwards, my mom got really angry then yelled at me saying things like ""You're embarassing yourself"" ""You only want attention"".

I later had enough and I ended up yelling towards her as well saying that ""You don't even care about your own child.""

She then broke down in tears after i said that and she went to her room crying but i feel like a terrible person, part of me wishes I never said that and I absolutely hate hearing my parents cry especially now that I am the one who caused it..",Not the A-hole,2024-11-04,"AITA for making my mom cry?

85,1gj7zhi,AITA for not having the habit to clean? ,"Since I was young, my mom has always held onto an unnecessary amount of things. I wouldn't call her a hoarder but by definition, she is one. My mom would always keep things 'just in case', there was a time when she had an abundance amount of products on her vanity-- just for us to throw away 50% of them because of the expiration or her not using them. It gets even worse with clothes. Whenever it came to clothes, she'd always buy and buy clothes for my sister and me. Of course, as a teenage girl, I love that. But am I throwing away clothes? That's a whole other dilemma of its own. Have you guys ever had too much clothes to wear? Well, imagine having so many clothes to the point where you purchase luggage to have more room for clothes. Hell, the walk-in closet in my mom's room isn't even a walk-in anymore, it's a shuffle-in closet from all the suitcases inside(Be mindful we live in an apartment so it's not big, to begin with). As usual, since I'm the youngest, I do get hand-me-downs. However, I can't get rid of my other clothes without my mom assuring me I'll need them eventually. This all caused my clothes to pile up and caused me not to wear a lot of my clothes because of how overwhelming the amount was. My mom always complains about me not wearing a lot of my clothes, I don't blame her honestly she's the one buying them the least I can do is wear them.

So, my sister and I always had a certain degree of mess in our lives that we lived with. I can say that those who have hoarder parents know how it feels trying to clean up. You clean just for it to get dirty again, you try to get rid of stuff just to get ushered on how much you 'need' it. As much as I want to stay clean and tidy, that degree of mess I'm used to having around sort of numbed me down when it comes to having the urge to clean when I see something untidy. My mom hates this, of course, she constantly complains about us not cleaning and how she's the only one tidying up. I do agree, I should take some imitative and get my lazy ass up. But, if I'm so used to having a certain degree of mess around-- especially seeing the environment my mom has set up for me. It's so hard to fix what I consider my norm. It's so much harder to clean when there's so much around, it's so much harder to clean when you look out your balcony and it's become an outdoor storage room. AITA? I feel like I am, I should be nicer to my mom and take initiative. She's hard working you know?

86,1gj7tsm,AITA for adding consent into my webcomic?,"Sorry for the weird title and horrible formatting, I am just so confused right now.

I 18F, am currently trying to write and illustrate a webcomic and my friend group is helping me with it, my friend, Dany (fake name and 19F) is helping me work out a script for it.

Here’s the issue, the main couple have a scene were they do kiss and do some foreplay, but they don’t go much further than that because one of them isn’t ready and when Dany read this, she said I should make them have sex anyway.

I pointed out the lore with it but she said readers wouldn’t like it because it takes away the spark from the scene and I needed to make it more ‘playful’.

When I asked what she defined as playful, she showed me a bit from a BL webcomic that had one character saying no while the other ignoring them and basically forcing the other to do it. I refused again, saying it was my comic, and I could do what I want with my characters.

That upset her, and she said I was being a stuck-up prude for not including some sex scenes. Now she told our friend group and they are all saying I should just include the sex, but it’s my characters and my comic, what is the big deal???

Sorry for grammar or wording, I’m tried and very confused.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-04,"AITA for adding consent into my webcomic? Sorry for the weird title and horrible formatting, I am just so confused right now.
