0,1gjbmio,AITA for picking a 'disrespectful name'?,"I (18m) am transgender.  
I first came out to my parents 4 years ago, and realised that I'm trans a few months earlier, when I was 13. My parents did not take that well at all. They claimed everything to be a phase, that I'm confused, or that I have some other unresolved issues that cause me to think this.

About two years ago I told my parents that I've picked a name (I'd been using a 'placeholder name' for over 2 years until that point). The name is based on the second name that they gave me when I was born, which is after my grandmother. My current name is the closest masculine version of that after 1 other version which I hate. 

Yesterday, my parents found out that my second chosen name is a male version of my 'original' first name that pretty much sounds the same (think noa/noah). My parents hated it, which I find understandable since they've been struggling from the beginning with me changing my name at all. I specifically picked my name, both first and second, because I wanted to respect my parents and not stray too far from my birth name so that they'd find this pill slightly easier to swallow.

My dad said that I'm extremely disrespectful to make a mockery of their choice like that, and that not consulting with them makes it so much worse. He said that since I only ever think about myself, walk all over their choices, and hurt them all the time, I shouldn't have made a mockery of the name they took effort in picking for me and should just stay with my first name. My mom was also very offended for not asking them beforehand, but they've never so much as called me by my name, even the first name which I thought they were more-or-less fine with? Why would I ask the people who refuse to have the conversation or admit that I'm trans every time I try to bring it up in any way?

1,1gj8fwh,AITA for my top priority not being doing what my mom asked? ,"For context, I(15M) am transgender. I was born female but I identify as male. All my friends and my little sister use the pronouns and name I'm comfortable with, but my mom doesn't. She doesn't purposely do it, but she's not trying not to either. I know it might be hard for a cis person to understand, but being misgendered and deadnamed hurts. It's makes my dysphoria worse and just overall ruins my day.

My mom also will sometimes hit me and my sister. Not very often, not abusively and not enough to leave a bruise, but not just a spank. She also loves to yell and cuss me and my sister out for smaller things like not doing the dishes or not going to bed on time. For like 4 or 5 years, I was also doing all the cooking and cleaning, and making sure my sister was taken care off but a few months ago I put my foot down and refused (got severely punished but at least I'm not acting like my sister's dad anymore).

I don't think this is abuse, but it's enough to make me hate her. I genuinely don't feel any love for my mother anymore. She refuses to acknowledge that I'm her son, not her daughter even though I pass really well (for someone who's not on T yet). Because of this I really don't give a shit when she asks me to do things like the dishes. If anything, I just want to ignore her and piss her off because she feels more like an annoying roommate you can't wait to move out rather than my mother.

2,1gjlzay,AITA for screwing my parents and leaving their house ,"I (19F) was adopted into my family when I was in middle school. My adoptive parents have always had a weird relationship with us. Most importantly my ‚Äúmom‚Äù. She never called me or my other siblings her ‚Äúreal kids‚Äù or never treated us like it. She favors the boys in our house a lot more than the girls, especially my youngest sibling. She has always called him her real kid and treats him like a spoiled brat. My other younger siblings get picked on and bullied by my parents and if I stood up for them, I‚Äôd get yelled at and punished. My mom especially liked to pick on me, about my looks, my intelligence, and my interests. She caused a lot of damage in my self esteem and continues to do so in my relationship. Growing up with them, they always wanted a big amount of control over me and always had to have a grasp on what I was wanting to do with my life. I was an outcast for not working in the family business and they bullied me relentlessly during that period. My dad made me quit my job. (After saying he was okay with it, he‚Äôs very unpredictable). They never allowed me to explore on my own and kept me tied down to their household.

Anyways, my fianc√© recently moved in with me and my parents house. Which I‚Äôve come to realize was a big mistake. I never should have brought him here and everything had become worst. My mom talks badly about my partner and then says the nicest things to his face. She put more responsibilities on me even though I have been taking care of dogs and her kids (she owns 11 dogs). She continues to belittle and refuses to help me get a job. (We don‚Äôt have a car yet since my partner just moved across the country). I‚Äôve tried working with them and finding odd jobs but it‚Äôs impossible to be hired anywhere anymore. But recently I had told my parents about my recent engagement, explaining that it‚Äôs going be a long one and that it‚Äôll be a few years until we have a wedding. My mom then looked at my fiance and asked him if he was sure about marrying me. In that moment, I realized how much my mom cared about me. She had emotional damaged me for years and never tried to help me succeed. She only had kept me around and wanted me to stay in her house because I do everything. I am nothing but a housekeeper and dog sitter to her. I‚Äôm not a daughter to her. So in two weeks, I am packing everything up and leaving this house. I‚Äôm not telling anyone and I‚Äôm leaving very early in the morning. I will not stand for the disrespect and abuse anymore, and she will be screwed without me. They will have no one to watch the dogs while my mom works and my dad drinks until he passes out for the rest of their lives. They will have no one to help feed their kids.

4,1gjlunp,AITA for leaving my university theatre production as a co-director?,"This project was led by me, Emma and Jess (fake names). 

It‚Äôs important to know that it‚Äôs a classic play, but with a secondary storyline added by us that‚Äôd be a modern parallel of the original text. For this B story we hadn‚Äôt yet written all the scenes, but did have a fairly good vision (in my mind). Only the ending we still disagreed on, especially me and Jess.

Last week we had auditions and on Friday sat together to decide on the casting. During this meeting 4 new roles for the B story get invented (there were 3 before). I already had and expressed doubts about this then, but only in the weekend could articulate them properly.

Emma and Jess had busy weekends so I texted that I felt this was a big and rushed decision into unknown territory and a mistake. The additions felt like a step away from the vision we‚Äôd worked on together for the past 2 months. I didn‚Äôt yet have an idea what these roles would add and we‚Äôd need to fully rebuild the B story around these roles if we‚Äôd cast them already, since we‚Äôd be stuck with them.

Jess responded that we didn‚Äôt have much of a clear vision on the B story yet and that if we did we‚Äôd have the script already. Emma responded that she felt the decision was already made on Friday and it was 2 against 1.

I urged to discuss this point at the meeting Monday as it was big deal to me. We‚Äôd planned it way before specifically to finally finish the B story cause Jess wanted a script done this week. Discussing this on Monday however would mean delaying the casting announcements by a day or 2 and Emma and Jess didn‚Äôt want to delay it any further and risk seeming unprofessional. So, as I felt the discussion was still going on, Jess sent out the casting announcement already.

Feeling very disrespected and ignored I sent the announcement to the one guy who didn‚Äôt make the cast since I‚Äôd promised to and left the production yesterday.

I like to think I am very okay with things not often going my way, but I hate big sudden irreversible decisions that I feel weren‚Äôt at all thought out.

I wanted to discuss this at the B story meeting and all that‚Äôd need to be done was for the casting announcements to be delayed a day or 2.

I also left because I‚Äôve been in projects before where I had a role that deserved some respect, but was ultimately ignored or not taken seriously.

5,1gjls9p,AITA for calling my step dad a POS for making my mom do chores days after surgery. ,"So my mother just had a full hysterectomy on the 30th. Which means as of right now she's only 5 days out of recovery today. Yesterday my stepdad went out on a bender to some golfing place where he already got hammered, I picked him up and he asked me to take him to the casino (he has a gambling problem already and a drinking problem where he goes through almost 15-20 cans of beer a day) where he was for almost 3 more hours before coming home. 

I had to work in the morning so I went to go to bed and I overheard him come home and not even 5 minutes into being home he's ordering my mom to get him a beer, to give him a menu of what we have in the house so SHE can make him something to eat, and to let the dogs out. Again she's 4 DAYS out of surgery for a full hysterectomy at the time of this happening. Naturally upon hearing this I got up and went downstairs saw the literal pain in my mom's face from begining to do those chores and told her to go sit down and relax. I then stood there and waited for him to ask for another beer like he usually does. 

When he did I told him ""go get your own beer right now"" to which he wined my name at me and I added ""my mom is 4 days out of surgery..."" And that's when he laughed and turned up his music using his surround sound so loud that he couldn't hear me. So I immediately went and dumped out all 50 beers he had in the fridge. Every single one.

My mom begged me to go upstairs so I did and I overheard him yelling at her so I went back down and blew up on his about what I'm arguing is abuse for making my mom do chores 4 days after a full hysterectomy and I called him a lazy POS for doing what he did. It was a whole big thing. Now after he's finally sobered up he's demanding we apologize to him for damaging his property and talking to him like that in ""his own home"" and that he doesn't need to apologize for anything because he didn't do anything wrong. 

He is now demanding that we either 1. I apologize completely for everything we did Or 2. My mom kicks me out because now he no longer feels safe in his own home because he now thinks I'm gonna be at his ass and break his property because of me pouring out all of his beers and telling him in his drunken stuper how he was abusing my mother. He's also now claiming I stole 200 dollars out of his wallet but that's just a cherry on top.

8,1gjlec9,WIBTA for leaving my current roommate behind to live with closer friends next year?,"So I, F(20), am in my 3rd year of college and currently planning to move into a 5-bedroom house next year with four of my closest friends. Right now, I share an apartment with two of them and an old friend from high school (who I'll call Sarah). While Sarah and I get along, our relationship feels just like a roommate relationship and not a close friendship. I hang out with my other four friends outside of classes and feel much closer to them.

Recently, one of my friends talked to Sarah about her living plans for next year, and Sarah just assumed we‚Äôd all continue living together. She mentioned she doesn't really have anyone else to live with, which is understandable, and she believes we‚Äôll stay roommates. The problem is, my other friends and I aren‚Äôt keen on including Sarah in our plans because she‚Äôs caused issues, such as racking up our electric bill by using a lot of power and filling the apartment with smoke when she cooks due to frequently burning her food.

So I, F(20), am in my 3rd year of college and currently planning to move into a 5-bedroom house next year with four of my closest friends. Right now, I share an apartment with two of them and an old friend from high school (who I'll call Sarah). While Sarah and I get along, our relationship feels just like a roommate relationship and not a close friendship. I hang out with my other four friends outside of classes and feel much closer to them.

Recently, one of my friends talked to Sarah about her living plans for next year, and Sarah just assumed we‚Äôd all continue living together. She mentioned she doesn't really have anyone else to live with, which is understandable, and she believes we‚Äôll stay roommates. The problem is, my other friends and I aren‚Äôt keen on including Sarah in our plans because she‚Äôs caused issues, such as racking up our electric bill by using a lot of power and filling the apartment with smoke when she cooks due to frequently burning her food.

There has been a guy in his 20s that has been coming in for about 8 months now and all he does is go straight to the bathroom, takes a dump for 20-30mins and then leaves. This wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, except the bathroom walls do not reach the ceiling and the smell permeates the entire gym.

I never want to make anyone feel unwelcome at the gym, especially if it‚Äôs a medical issue. I politely asked if he could maybe try flushing a couple of times while he‚Äôs going to just help with the smell and I never saw him after that day.

She was extremely mentally & emotionally abusive in my teenage years. We fought multiple times a day. I was under immense pressure to perform in tennis & my academics. I would be screamed at if my grades weren't perfect. I was berated for not trying hard enough, even after I was diagnosed with ADD, got meds, and straight A‚Äôs. She would also weigh me on a weekly basis and scold me when I gained weight, and she sent me to fat camp multiple times as a kid. She even made me be a camp counselor to ‚Äúlose some weight before college‚Äù and refused to pick me up when everyone quit and I was left to run the camp by myself, I was only 19. Nothing I did was ever good enough.¬†

Freshman year of HS I had a new tennis coach. I was very close to my coach, and a year later he was shot & killed. His death hit me like a train- I felt that I had lost a crucial male figure in my life. My mom refused to let me miss any school bc ""high school is too important"". I became depressed & she accused me of being on drugs & threatened to drug test me. I was absolutely gutted by the lack of trust- I had never done any drugs or alcohol. She finally put me in group therapy at my school, but pulled me out shortly after when she realized I was being taken out of class for it. She told me that ""God took \[my coach\] away from me because I didn't appreciate him enough."" To this day I cannot go into a church without balling & thinking that God hates me & took away someone I cared so much about.

During our fights I would tell her that when I went to college I would cut communication off with her forever. My dad told me to write my mom a letter telling her how I felt & I wrote that I would never have kids because I didn‚Äôt want them around her. Since then she has been making a huge effort to mend our relationship & fix herself, and recently our relationship has been good. She still makes a few remarks here & there, and being with her in person leads to a few fights, but overall it is night & day.

My parents have been asking me when I am going to get married & have kids because they want to be grandparents. I haven't been in a relationship in over 3 years and I'm not seeing anyone. I told my mom that I don't think I want to have kids and she called me ""selfish"". She told me that her & my dad are gutted that I would deprive them of being grandparents and said it's ""not fair"" that I am still punishing her for her past mistakes. She also asked me how I expect to find a husband if I don't want to have children. Although I initially said those things to hurt my mom, I really don't know if I want to have kids. I know that she has made a real effort and change to fix our relationship, but I still hold some resentment towards her from the past. She cries thinking about the fact that she might not be a grandmother, and I can't help but feel bad that I would be depriving her of that and unfairly punishing my dad when she has made a real effort to change.

Edit: Just wanted to provide some clarity for some of the things I've been seeing in the comments. I am not an only child- I do have a younger sister who probably wants to have children, but she wants to pursue medical school and wouldn't be able to start a family for some time. My mom believes that since I am the oldest I should be the first to get married and have children, and since I want to go to law school (a 3yr program vs 8+yrs med school) I should be able to have kids soon.

 I've been to a couple of cons before this, the first one was me and my family, the second was me, my mum, and my friend. My mum also really likes to cosplay and has her own one. I love that I have a mum who shares my interests and I feel really lucky.

 But the second time I went to a con and she found out my friend was coming she felt kinda disappointed bc she wanted to spend time with me. I can understand that, I'd probably feel the same in her situation. But I was really excited as I'd only been to one con before and it was quite small and I'd never been to a con with a friend before. 

Me and my mum have recently been planning another con next year. I really wanted my friend to come too. Me and her were planning on going as Allen and Rilliane, they're from evillious chronicles for anyone who doesn't know, and I was pretty excited as we'd be staying overnight in a hotel. But once again, my mum was disappointed that it wouldn't be just us. And she made that pretty obvious.

 So now I feel really guilty about this. But Idk if this is my fault for not spending any time with my mum and I should just go without my friend, or it's her overreacting. I was considering maybe just going to another con with just her? Like, it's just that my friend is important to me and I love spending time with her.

This had horrible effects on their life and ability to muster the energy to do much. It was a terrible time for them and throughout it I and the other best friend (we'll call them Asher) tried our best to support them. One of the things we did to offer this support was ensure generous timing with schedules so that schedules were malleable enough for Riley to be included.



Fast forward a couple years and Riley was amazingly in remission and had really put in the effort and gotten their life back together. The whole schedule thing just got awful though. It all came to a head when one day while trying to work with this wild schedule Riley had told me that ""im also dating again and that takes up a good chunk of time too"". This rubbed both Asher and I the wrong way, as we felt that we as Riley's friends were being ghosted and our time wasted not because Riley couldn't help their circumstances but instead because they were actively putting us on the back burner for their new dating partner.



Asher and I brought up our grievances to Riley and it did not go well. They denied putting us on the back burner, said it really was their current circumstance dealing with stuff that had them, and expressed surprise as Asher and I explained that when we plan for things and Riley shows up late that they have wasted and disrespected our time. When I showed them their own quote about dating again taking up lots of time, they doubled down and Riley was so upset they left the conversation.



All that leads to the actual 'lie' from the title. After the previous disagreement Riley and I had a one on one conversation. Riley was convinced that Asher and I were only hounding them because they were dating, so I brought up that the exact situation of Riley scheduling something, ghosting me, lying about it, then getting angry about being called out has happened before.

I remember experiencing a bit of an emotional shock at Riley going back on the entire ""denied putting us on the back burner"" and ""said it really was their current circumstance dealing with stuff that had them"" thing.

15,1gjgxmk,AITA for snapping at my husband?,"Soo my husband on the whole it great! We have 2 kids and he's a great dad. 
I'm a SAHM, discussed and agreed , his job can be stressful, he deals with lots of big events and lots of people management, at times it can be overwhelming. 

I've noticed that whenever things are hard in work with events coming up or he's struggling with peoples mistakes etc. he's just not as nice as home. 
To a certain degree im ok with this. I cant expect him to be nice and happy all the time. I support him in anyway I can. 

The main reason I snapped today was because he shouted at my 2yo. We have a system with discipline, we say no, warn him, and then get down on his level and sternly talk to him. Then it's naughty step and a potential shouting depending on the situation. 
Almost every time the job is stressful, this goes out the window with hubs. He just defaults to shouting straight away. 

My LO was super upset, he loves his dad ( further proof he's normally an awesome dad) 
I whispered to him, I think you shouted too soon. (We've agreed not to disagree with discipline in front of the children but back each other up) Well this time I just didn't want to keep my mouth shut 
Well hubs shouted at me that I shouldn't undermine him in front of our child. 

I snapped back, I said I was done with how he treats us when he stressed, we are not the bad guys and he cannot take his frustrations out on us, I told him to get out and leave us alone. he left for work then and we've not spoken since 

I've been for coffee with a friend and she thinks I was too harsh and that I should cut him some slack as he's in a stressful place with work. I'll admit I shouldn't have said about not shouting, as I went back on something we agreed on. I just hated seeing my LO cry because of it. I want to protect him. 

I don't really know how to handle the situation otherwise. I have spoken to hubs about this issue before and he always apologises and says he'll work on it. But I'm not seeing any change and don't know how to help this issue... But I won't have him taking work stress out on us as a family...


Edit to update: I'm grateful for all the practical advice, thanks! Just for info this was before work so the chilling out post work advice, (although super helpful for other situations!) wouldn't work here. It was his anticipation of work. But perhaps I can just say I'll deal with discipline before work most times. ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-04,"AITA for snapping at my husband? Soo my husband on the whole it great!

To a certain degree im ok with this. I cant expect him to be nice and happy all the time. I support him in anyway I can. 

The main reason I snapped today was because he shouted at my 2yo. We have a system with discipline, we say no, warn him, and then get down on his level and sternly talk to him. Then it's naughty step and a potential shouting depending on the situation. 
Almost every time the job is stressful, this goes out the window with hubs. He just defaults to shouting straight away. 

My LO was super upset, he loves his dad ( further proof he's normally an awesome dad) 
I whispered to him, I think you shouted too soon. (We've agreed not to disagree with discipline in front of the children but back each other up) Well this time I just didn't want to keep my mouth shut 
Well hubs shouted at me that I shouldn't undermine him in front of our child. 

I snapped back, I said I was done with how he treats us when he stressed, we are not the bad guys and he cannot take his frustrations out on us, I told him to get out and leave us alone. he left for work then and we've not spoken since 

I've been for coffee with a friend and she thinks I was too harsh and that I should cut him some slack as he's in a stressful place with work. I'll admit I shouldn't have said about not shouting, as I went back on something we agreed on. I just hated seeing my LO cry because of it. I want to protect him. 

I don't really know how to handle the situation otherwise. I have spoken to hubs about this issue before and he always apologises and says he'll work on it. But I'm not seeing any change and don't know how to help this issue... But I won't have him taking work stress out on us as a family...


Edit to update: I'm grateful for all the practical advice, thanks! Just for info this was before work so the chilling out post work advice, (although super helpful for other situations!) wouldn't work here. It was his anticipation of work. But perhaps I can just say I'll deal with discipline before work most times. ",0.0,-0.0125549361109733,0,1
16,1gjgwzp,AITA for not sharing the answers to my math homework?,"Ok, so, this kid (15M) I really dislike asked me (16F), on his friend's (15F) behalf, for the answers to our pre-calc homework. I'm not in class with the guy but his friend is, but I'm 'closer' to the guy (we're supposedly friends but I'm lowkey kinda fake about it trust if you knew him you'd be the same) so they asked me instead. 
Though, the kicker is, someone (15F) who is a lot closer to the guy (and is also my friend to be frank) is also in our class so I don't understand why he wouldn't just ask her. I guess I'm known as a ""smart kid"" but don't the smart ones stereotypically NOT give HW answers? He thought I was just chill like that idk. I fear he overestimated how much I value our 'friendship' (sorry). I personally don't give HW answers to people I'm not close to because I don't know if they'll straight up plagarize or just send in the same PDF as I did. I usually frown upon academic dishonesty but if it's nothing major I could care less. Just to help someone out yk? 
So, anyways, I didn't want to let my hate for 15M get in the way of helping the girl out, so I might've lied and settled for a healthy medium. I said I was hesitant to share because of ""middle school trauma"" (big fat lie, my pants are currently on fire) and then refrained from sending in the PDF of my HW and instead sent a handwritten explanation of how to solve each problem. Seemed sufficient to me! Apparently not. I got a text the next morning asking for the actual answers. And I may have deliberately waited until the HW's due date to respond, and it was too late by then. Whoops.
I think I might be the AH because I lied and left her on delivered, or maybe she might actually be going through something that limits her ability to complete the HW, but then again just email our teacher?

My brother (28m) set up a long holiday weekend trip with his regular group. In earlier years everyone paid the same, after pairing up he wanted to pay by room (great for couples, sucks for singles) and I (30f) routinely pushed back. This was our first trip on a boat but similar themes, can share details in comments.

I was on travel in NYC w/ 10-14 hour days and w/ 30 group emails to read on phone while actively working in a shared conference room. I zoned out assuming l'd be driving out with my brother like other trips attended with him. Called the Thursday before to check-in and learned they planned to meet at the boat midday Friday, not Saturday (info buried in the emails), and expected me to drive solo. Had a meeting Friday morning that was too late to change or I‚Äôd have packed up and tried to get a train home that night.

It was 7 hours to get home, and then driving 4 or 5 hours solo to get to the boat after was beyond me. I asked about meeting them on Saturday, and he mentioned his MIL had wanted to attend so he would see if she would take my place. I said I'd talk with our parents to see if there might be another solution. Dad offered to drive me on Saturday, and I called back but bro said MIL can go instead so don't worry about it. I was emotional knowing l'd messed up and feeling triggered about traumatic life events on the same holiday one year before.

After the trip, he said it went well and then asked for my payment. I expressed confusion. He said he couldn't charge his MIL after she had just paid even more for a dinner and drinks celebrating him. I said, I'm confused why you would discourage me from attending the trip a day late, say you found someone to replace me and don't worry about it, then ask me to pay for someone else's vacation. Said think on it and if you think it's fair Imk and I'll pay you, but rn it does not sound fair to me.

He dropped it but has slowly become increasingly distant, and recently our other brother (then 32m, now 43m) encouraged me (now 41f and disabled) to pay bro back saying I should have paid for the trip before it started anyway. That it would have been expensive to move houseboats a day after docking to reach a place where I could board. That it was silly to make a big deal about and it still annoyed our brother (now 38m) who had discussed it with him on their other trips.

18,1gjgp6s,AITA for blowing up at my sick brother?,"My (21F) brother (19M) has a rocky relationship with my family. He recently just waltzed back home after being MIA for a few months. He came back ill and he was taking these hardcore medications for some kind of stomach virus. He never said the specifics of his illness (he was very vague on the details and on what the doctor had said he had). He seemed to get better after a week, but the day before yesterday he said he was sick again. Now I don't doubt he was actually sick, I saw him need to vomit once. He is definitely ill, BUT I feel like he is milking just how ill he is.

The problem is that for the two days that his ""illness"" has returned he's been going to work normally, but when he comes home he just lies down in his bed on his phone. He also has been refusing to eat, saying that he can't otherwise he will throw up. Yesterday night was our moms birthday, we don't do anything big for birthdays in our house, we just get takeout, open presents and cut a cake. Instead of at least just sitting on the couch with us while our mom opened her presents and cut her cake he just stayed in his room. I at least made him sign the birthday card I got her, but other than that I don't think he congratulated, or even got her a present. I finally blew up at him this morning when he called me at 5 AM this morning to boil him some potatoes to eat (cause he finally got hungry), he's been calling me to get him water and stuff while he's been sick, but it just feels like he's taking advantage of me cause he can drive to work/work a full work day just fine. I blew up at him this morning and told him that his illness is ""very convenient"", and that it must be helpful to be able to ""switch it on and off"".

I just find it hard to believe that he's so sick when he's been able to drive to work for the past two days (its a 2 hour commute, so the round trip about 4 hours), but wasn't able to sit in the living room for an hour for our mom's birthday?? He doesn't even HAVE to go to work, his work place is very lenient and would not have minded if he took two days off to rest. Also his workplace has lots of kids around, so I'm even more wary of his 'illness' cause if he has a viral infection why is he going to work and potentially spreading his illness?? Not to mention how I find it hard to believe that he hasn't eaten anything other than the bananas I have given him for the past two days.

After I blew up at him this morning he cursed me and said that he hopes I get sick like him so I'd know how he feels. Now I'm double guessing myself, AITA for blowing up at him?

EDIT: I wanted to clarify that it has been a week since he recovered from his initial stomach bug. He said he got sick again (after the week where he was recovered) the day before yesterday and yesterday. He was eating normally for the week after he recovered, but since getting sick these past 2 days he has stopped eating food at home (until this morning when he asked me to make him boiled potatoes). I do not know if he is eating out.

  
EDIT 2: Wanted to clarify that I do care about my brother, I have been worrying about him (bringing him anything he needs, food, water) since he came back. He had recovered from the initial bug for a week, then claimed it resurfaced, after two days of being sick again I blew up at him, cause I felt like maybe he was taking advantage of me (bringing everything he needed, doing all the chores).",Asshole,2024-11-04,"AITA for blowing up at my sick brother?

19,1gjgp4t,AITA: kicking my brother in law out,"Back story: 5 months ago, my BIL (47) moved in with my wife (his sister) because he had no place to go, no money, no backup and no friends that would help him out. He was living in his own apartment because him and his wife were terrible for each other 25 years, cheated on each other constantly and were verbally and emotionally abusive to each other. They separated partially because their marriage was a shit show and he had an on-going affair. He has 3 kids; 22, 19, and 12. 

His plan was to run away with this mistress to where we live so he could have some family nearby and start over. His mistress was going to fund this whole ordeal but backed at the 11th hour, leaving him with nothing. At this point he had nothing. My wife and I decided he could come and stay with us until he got back on his feet, mentally and financially.

The only way to do that though was to send him gas money for the whole trip because he said he was broke and had less than $100 to his name. We told him prior to him heading this direction that he would need to pay rent ($400/mo), keep the room he stays in clean and take care of the 2 dogs he was bringing with him. (Side note: my wife and I already have 6 dogs so the extra puppers were not an issue.)

We were arguing about him because 2 days ago, he got up to go somewhere and when he got home to take his dogs out he screamed so loud at them and with so many profanities that our neighbor called my wife to see if her and our son were ok. Our neighbor thought I was doing something to them in a way that was so loud from a concrete basement, she called to check. After he took his dogs out, I said ""hey man, you can't scream like that, our neighbor called because she thought something bad was happening,"" and instead of realizing his mistake, he said he was tired of the lectures, started crying and then went back to his room in the basement. He didn't come out for more than 24 hours. He went to work last night and my wife wanted to check his room after he left.

She walked in and the smell was horrific, trash everywhere, clothes spilling out of the closet like a hoarder, just absolutely unacceptable. He had plastic fountain cups of his urine everywhere, some with lids and some without. He had also urinated in one of our dishes that we use for drinking. We found some of our dishes in trash bags that also had dog shit in them. It was one of the most disgusting things I've ever been a witness to and I've seen a lot of terrible shit.

So my wife and I have decided that he has to go as soon as he gets a full paycheck. Although we're not sure how to tell him because of how unstable he is. We plan on speaking with the police because I don't want him to hurt us, destroy our stuff anymore than he already has or hurt his dogs out of anger.

My mum has a tendency to say things before she thinks and she hurts my feelings more than I care to admit.

My boyfriend(22m) and i (19f) have only been dating for three months. i jumped into this relationship a couple of days after i broke up with my ex that i was with for about a year. during the start of the relationship he had doubts that he was just a rebound, but i reassured him that i had no love left for my ex, and that the relationship was over for months before we actually broke up. he told me that i should avoid texting him or going to functions that he may be at.  last night was my roommates 21st birthday. she shares the same friend group as my ex. i haven‚Äôt seen this group of friends in months out of respect for my boyfriend. and i couldn‚Äôt even go to roommates birthday party next weekend bc i was supposed go to my boyfriends hometown. 

so my roommate invites me to this and says your boyfriend is welcome to come but just warning you that friend group is invited so she doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll be awkward. i agreed and told my boyfriend this. i kind of implied that he shouldn‚Äôt be there. she also tells me she didn‚Äôt invite my ex but she‚Äôs not gonna tell him he‚Äôs not allowed so there might be a possibility he would show up at some point. i told my boyfriend that i would throw her in the fountain and come straight back to him after. i got there and my roommate was begging me to go out with her to the club after and truthfully i kinda wanted to go. my boyfriend voiced his concerns and said this was crossing a line and it made him uncomfortable. 

i was having a good time with these friends who i missed a lot and i knew this was gonna be my only opportunity to see them. I ended up going out and seeing my ex with his new girlfriend. yes i know i disrespected my boyfriend but i felt that it was unfair for this to be taken away from me and if we‚Äôre taking feelings out of the equation, i wasn‚Äôt doing anything morally wrong. i felt secure and confident in my relationship as he is in his i‚Äôm assuming. im admitting i crossed the line and went against him but i really wanted to go and see my friends.

23,1gjfwcq,AITA For procrastinating my chore?,"I (21 f) and my boyfriend (23) have been arguing a lot recently. It seems to be the same argument over and over. I am always the one in the wrong because I am ‚Äúbeing a selfish brat and cunt because I am intentionally talking back to get on his bad side‚Äù. 

This one started Sunday night when he was going to make him some food. He saw that he needed a dish that was dirty in the sink, and his only chore is dishes, he went ahead and washed them all.

My only designated chore is laundry. So I made sure he had all the clothes he needed for work the next day and said I would do the rest tomorrow (my 2nd day off). the basket was full so I would have to do 2 loads but it wasn‚Äôt an overwhelming amount. 

CONTEXT: 
Our house, I do all the cooking and most of the cleaning unless I ask for help, he usually agrees to. We have 2 dogs so the house needs a good dusting and vacuuming pretty often. 

I work Tues-Sat and he works the typical work week. I work 50 hours, he works 40. 

I‚Äôm the head kitchen manager and have a lot of responsibilities. I do prep, cook, and make plates. There is rarely a time in the 10hr days that I‚Äôm not on my feet. It also doesn‚Äôt help that we are understaffed. 

Friday night he decided to have his brother and sister in law over to the house. It rolled around to be 1 am and I knew I had to be up at 5am so I went to go to bed. I don‚Äôt blame my boyfriend or his brother because they don‚Äôt hang out much, but they kept waking me up. the planned 4 hrs of sleep turned into 3. I come home exhausted and I crashed.

It is a mutual agreement that Sundays are the chill around the house day. 

I typically use Monday to catch up on laundry and do some cleaning around the house. Some Mondays he leaves dishes for me to do and I‚Äôll go ahead and wash them for him. Monday  is my productive day. 

ARGUMENT:
He is doing his dishes when he strongly suggests I get up and go do laundry when he is doing dishes. I state that I made sure he has clothes ready for him tomorrow and that I would finish it all the next day.

He says that there is no real reason not to do it right now, which is a valid point but I say Saturday is my one day to truly relax and do nothing. My one day to not worry about cooking, cleaning, or work as it sometimes demands me to do work from home. 

He seems adamant on me starting my chores when he‚Äôs doing his so I begrudgingly go start folding. After he gets done with his dishes, he sees me folding and starts to criticize why I didn‚Äôt start the laundry and begin folding first. 

Anyway, it turns into this whole argument about how I always talk back and never want to be on his side. He starts yelling about how I am a lazy piece of shit and why would I want to project myself as lazy to him? I can never be on his side and he always has to argue stupid shit to me.

AITA for dodging my mother‚Äôs calls while she is still in hospital recovering from open heart surgery?

I (52F) have a long-time dysfunctional relationship with my mom (74F). We had a not bad relationship until she left my father and soon after moved in with her boyfriend ‚ÄúFred‚Äù (40sM). My younger brother and I moved in with them as well in a town an hour away from where I grew up.

The dynamic was weird. For my 18th birthday she (they?) gave me a ‚Äúsexy‚Äù lace teddy!?! I was quiet, a bookworm and kept to myself at home. A few months after my 18th birthday, I was going camping with a youth group and decided to walk to the pickup point instead of asking Fred for a drive since he was too drunk to drive IMHO.  (Note- earlier to this, my younger brother had been kicked out because he wanted to see his friends in our home town).
When I got home, I was told I was too disrespectful for not asking for a ride and they kicked me out. I could not go back to my father as one of his friends had been SA me for years and I was not willing to go back. And my relationship with my father was not the best since he was the disciplinarian in the family and a little too violent with his discipline.
Thankfully, one of the leaders of the youth group had an empty apartment above his business and he let me move in rent free. Otherwise, I would have had to couch surf or live on the streets. I was still in school and had to work to get food on the table.

I did not cut ties with my mom as I was still in the ‚Äúshe is my mom I have to love her‚Äù mode. What eventually made me go low contact was how she treated my relationship with my now husband. When his family found out my situation, they let me move in with them (11 hours away). I think she got offended they were treating me better than she did, and she never really supported our relationship. When I took the bus up to visit and tell her I was engaged, she didn‚Äôt want to spend time just us, she wanted to drag me to the bars with her cronies. When I said that didn‚Äôt interest me, she got very bitter. When the wedding came, she made one BS reason after the other on why she couldn‚Äôt attend (her mom and sisters did and offered a room, transportation. We got married where we met, which was a 4-hour drive for her, and a 9-hour drive for us. One of her sisters flew in from what would have been a 21-hour drive. Of course, she made it to all 3 of my  brothers‚Äô weddings (and 2 of my brothers have been married multiple times ‚Äì she went to all those weddings).

Since then, I have not initiated contact. She calls on most birthday and Christmas, but never anniversary. Until she got FB, she never even acknowledged her two grandchildren by us. Not even a card. And she never acknowledged the pain she caused even when I was forced to see her at her mom‚Äôs funeral. It still hurts that she refused to go to her only daughter‚Äôs wedding.

Now a few weeks ago, she had a heart attack and ended up in ICU needing a bypass. They flew her to a big city where one of my kids happens to live. We have let both kids have whatever relationship they want with her, but she literally has never met this one. She has been calling every night except when she was too sleepy from the surgery. The last two nights I have screened her calls.

I have had quite a few hospital stays, including Covid, emergency spinal surgery and heart issues. She has not once sent a card or phoned, let alone even made much of an acknowledgment on FB whenever these have happened.

27,1gjexbk,AITA for refusing to do household chores during the week and only doing them on the weekend?,"...............
Hi, my name is Jenifer. I'm a 22-year-old woman. I live with my mom and two siblings (16 and 20 years old). I work in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon, and I go to college in the evening. Currently, I‚Äôm taking seven courses and doing two internships, along with my job, which takes up a lot of my time. I live far from the university, so I need to take two buses to get there. My sister (16) is in her last year of high school, and my brother (20) dropped out of college and works at a pizzeria. My mom assigns most of the household chores to me, maybe because I‚Äôm older or wake up earlier (since I work at the university and it‚Äôs far away). Sometimes she leaves voice messages saying things like:

""Even if you don‚Äôt have time, do this or do that.""

She says this as if I had nothing else to do or as if I were the only one living with her. In the past, I had trouble saying ‚Äúno,‚Äù but nowadays it‚Äôs much easier for me. So, whenever I have a busy day, which happens most of the time, I can‚Äôt do anything at home. The college offers meals for one real (I live in Brazil), so it‚Äôs very cheap, and I have lunch and dinner there since I study at night. When I get home, around 11 pm, I just shower and sleep. I only have time to do chores on weekends. Even though my mom knows my routine, she still asks me to do most of the things at home, which makes me upset, as if she ignores my studies, work, and the fact that I get tired too.

My sister studies in the morning, and my brother wakes up only between 11 am and 12 pm. He works until 1 am, so it‚Äôs understandable. But it‚Äôs not every day that he works. Recently, I found out (waking up at night to go to the bathroom) that my brother stays on his phone until 4 or 5 am, which is why he wakes up later the next day. Anyway‚Ä¶ he doesn‚Äôt do any chores at home, always using the excuse that he‚Äôs going to be late for work (which starts at 6 pm and is only two streets away from our house).

Back to my mom: she gets really upset when I get home early, around 7 or 8 pm, and just have dinner or sleep, because, I imagine, she thinks I could do something at that time and that I‚Äôm not tired. But she has always done this; she always assigned me more tasks, even when I was a full-time student in high school and only got home at 9 pm (I was a teenager).

So, sometimes I refuse to do chores because I‚Äôm tired or need to leave very early in the morning, and she argues with me about it as if there weren‚Äôt other people in the house who have the time to do them. On the weekdays when I‚Äôm off, I do the chores without complaining (after all, I live here too), but I notice that my siblings don‚Äôt move to help, so I end up doing everything by myself, and the same thing happens the next day and so on.

So, I wanted to ask: am I being unreasonable for refusing to do chores when I have such a heavy routine?

Please leave your opinions on how I can improve this and if I should be more productive at home. Hugs from Brazil to everyone ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

The college offers meals for one real (I live in Brazil), so it‚Äôs very cheap, and I have lunch and dinner there since I study at night. When I get home, around 11 pm, I just shower and sleep. I only have time to do chores on weekends. Even though my mom knows my routine, she still asks me to do most of the things at home, which makes me upset, as if she ignores my studies, work, and the fact that I get tired too.

My sister studies in the morning, and my brother wakes up only between 11 am and 12 pm. He works until 1 am, so it‚Äôs understandable. But it‚Äôs not every day that he works. Recently, I found out (waking up at night to go to the bathroom) that my brother stays on his phone until 4 or 5 am, which is why he wakes up later the next day. Anyway‚Ä¶ he doesn‚Äôt do any chores at home, always using the excuse that he‚Äôs going to be late for work (which starts at 6 pm and is only two streets away from our house).

Back to my mom: she gets really upset when I get home early, around 7 or 8 pm, and just have dinner or sleep, because, I imagine, she thinks I could do something at that time and that I‚Äôm not tired. But she has always done this; she always assigned me more tasks, even when I was a full-time student in high school and only got home at 9 pm (I was a teenager).

So, sometimes I refuse to do chores because I‚Äôm tired or need to leave very early in the morning, and she argues with me about it as if there weren‚Äôt other people in the house who have the time to do them. On the weekdays when I‚Äôm off, I do the chores without complaining (after all, I live here too), but I notice that my siblings don‚Äôt move to help, so I end up doing everything by myself, and the same thing happens the next day and so on.

So, I wanted to ask: am I being unreasonable for refusing to do chores when I have such a heavy routine?

Please leave your opinions on how I can improve this and if I should be more productive at home. Hugs from Brazil to everyone ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

31,1gje3xe,AITA for telling my mom not to invite a racist for Christmas ,"I (27f) and my best friend (27f) have known each other since we were little kids. At this point we‚Äôre more like sisters than friends. My friend, I‚Äôll called her Jessica, grew up never liking sympathy.

She grew up with a brilliant single mom (let‚Äôs call her Alison). She always taught Jessica to never judge a person based on race, sexuality, etc. Last year, Jessica went through a really rough time: she lost her dream job and ended a 5 year relationship with her boyfriend (28m)

A few months later, she has a fling with this guy (23M) who we‚Äôll call Greg. It started very casual. Greg didn‚Äôt want anything serious at all. He‚Äôd told friends Jessica was ‚Äútoo skinny‚Äù and ‚Äútoo much drama‚Äù. This stuff got back to Jessica and although it really upset her, they still would hook up because, again, nothing serious. 

Jessica told me about all his red flags: he had a son from a previous fling (she hates the idea of being a step mom) he was part of a dangerous motorbike gang and, worst of all, he had a real problem with black people. She refused to say in detail but it was stuff she was horrified by. Greg even announced that he didn‚Äôt care that he was a racist, even wore it proudly. I was shocked and said ‚Äúsurely, you won‚Äôt see him again‚Äù She explained that it was just sex and she‚Äôs told him she didn‚Äôt want to hear anymore racist stuff. She comforted me by saying it would likely fizzle out soon.

Suddenly just after Christmas last year, Alison died. She‚Äôs never been a healthy woman but it still felt sudden. With Alison gone, my parents and I were the closest to family Jessica had. As she had all of her life, she‚Äôd only accept comfort for a short amount of time. Still, I stayed with her that night. 

Alison wasn‚Äôt rich, but being the only family, Jessica was set to inherit a lot of money. Greg suddenly became very interested in having a serious relationship with her: talks of Greg being her boyfriend, of them getting pets together, of them moving in together. Short of having a full on argument, I‚Äôve questioned Jessica as to why on earth she was getting serious with this racist. She‚Äôd argue that I didn‚Äôt know him like she did. It‚Äôs too convenient that this guy suddenly doesn‚Äôt mind the ‚Äúdrama‚Äù once she inherits a huge sum of money.

Traditionally, because it was just Jessica and Alison for years, they‚Äôd come for xmas dinner at my parent‚Äôs house. My mom decided this year, despite my mistrust and dislike of Greg, to invite him to Xmas. I still have never met him and he‚Äôs coming on Xmas? I told my mom how against the idea I was. I‚Äôve been losing Sleep worrying and I ended up in tears at how messed up the whole situation seems. How I feel alone in seeing how this guy is preying on my grieving friend. My mom said he‚Äôd uninvite him months ago but a conversation with Jessica the other week proves she never did

I feel almost gaslit at this point. Greg is clearly not a good man and we all have to just accept this isn‚Äôt messed up.

32,1gje2i5,AITA for 'lacking emotional intelligence' ,"Me and my friends (all M19) were sitting around and talking as we do any time we're free together. As our discussion continued, one of my friends remarked that he saw a new pizza place open in our city called Susan (fake name)'s pizza. Susan is the name of my friend's ex. 

Our friend group has been tightly knit for years now so we know a lot about each others lives and make jokes about exes or crushes a lot, so I make a joke about ""well we can't invite \[friend\] to a hang out there"". It was light hearted and I didn't mean anything by it. My friend responded with a joke of his own about a girl I used to like, and so we kind of just had a back and forth until he snapped and got angry at me, saying something like ""yeah you know that emotional intelligence you have? maybe you should use it.""

After he said that, the vibe quickly soured and we all kind of just went quiet. He sort of distanced himself and the rest of us continued talking about something else until it was time to go. It feels like there's a wall between us now and I really can not stand the suffocating atmosphere. 

Here's the thing. I have a very hard time recognizing emotions through implication, tone, body language, or other social cues. This is something that I've communicated to them and is a major insecurity of mine. I would've much rather preferred he just say 'hey man, can you not?' instead of up the ante and then explode. Instead he decided to belittle me and make fun of an insecurity of mine.

I (26M) live with my roommate (33M), who is also my coworker. We initially moved in together to share the cost of rent and groceries, and we were planning to buy a fridge together. However, since his girlfriend (28F) moved in about five months later, the dynamic has changed significantly, and that discussion was forgotten.

Now, we each buy our own groceries and kitchen supplies, including separate toiletries and even toilet paper. It feels like I‚Äôm a third wheel in my own home, and I no longer have the convenience of sharing space with my roommate. I was hoping to create a communal living environment, but instead, it has turned into separate lives.

Currently, I don‚Äôt have a fridge, and I‚Äôm considering buying one, especially since holiday sales are coming up. However, my roommate is unwilling to contribute to the cost, and I‚Äôm worried about sharing it with them since they seem to want everything separate now. 

When we both get home from work, his girlfriend is usually in the kitchen cooking, and I have to wait an hour or two to use the space. I‚Äôve suggested she cook earlier so that I can have time in the kitchen too, but my roommate prefers not to eat cold food. This situation has led to me frequently getting takeout, which is wasteful and affects my groceries since my fresh food often goes bad.

The bathroom situation is also frustrating. I handle cleaning it properly, using detergent and bleach, while they only mop with water. If the cleaning supplies run out, I end up replacing them, even if it means living with a dirty bathroom until I can afford more. This makes me concerned about how they would clean a fridge if I were to share one with them, especially since their version of cleaning the kitchen is just doing the dishes and putting them away.

I‚Äôve attempted to discuss house rules and boundaries with my roommate, but he believes we should just mind our own business as long as the rent is paid. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable addressing his girlfriend directly, as I‚Äôve noticed my roommate tends to side with her in conflicts. This has made it awkward for me to try to assert my needs.

My coworkers have said I would be the AH if I bought a fridge and didn‚Äôt share it with them, which adds to my confusion about what the right thing to do is.

While she's sober it's never a problem, she's a very good specialist. After our shift we might have to work a bit overtime, and it requires two crane operators. Me and mom are always staying if needed and it was exact te when she became drunk to an absolute nothing. I finished my overtime work and there was still no signs of her. She wasn't answering anyone's calls, including our boss. I called the guys who work with her, asked, where is she, and they said, that she was on crane still when they left. I went to check on her and found out that she was sleeping. I asked her if she's going home and all I heard as a drunk rumble, I couldn't understand a word. I knew it wasn't safe for the both of us to get her down of the crane (7 meters fall on a concrete is a massive no no) so I told her that I'm going home and she's gonna sleep on a crane. I was angry yeah, and yelled at her, but now I feel bad about what I did ‚Äì after all, she's my mother and if not me, who would take care of her? ",3.0,0.0039463145658373,0,0
35,1gjd8zu,AITA for accepting cash gifts from mum when my fianc√© is loaded af,"I (29m) have a corporate girl fianc√© (31f). Very hardworking, ambitious, super smart, and has an MBA so it‚Äôs not very surprising that she is climbing that corporate ladder like King Kong climbs the Empire State. She is now the Marketing Director of a company that boomed during the pandemic. More to this later.

Whereas here I am, lost and directionless at 29 working a nightfill position at a local supermarket. We met in 2017, at a time when she was very undercompensated from an old job until she moved to her current job in 2020.

Now my family knows she kind of fit the Asian overachiever stereotype (her words) and they know she works in Marketing for a big brand. But I guess they never expected her to be rich rich (income-wise). We live together and I am proud of myself for not being a mooch. However, my total income goes to bills, going out expenses, and the occasional flowers and gifts. I pull in 1k a week after tax which is livable and some in today‚Äôs economy. Absolutely no room for savings but we are at a point in our relationship where I know she‚Äôs got me if I do need money (she has verbally expressed this countless of times).

We also share the same values when it comes to money which is we‚Äôre not show offs. We even share one car (she works from home most of the time now), a 2022 Toyota Kluger. We eat whatever we want to eat and we rent in a good part of town (house will be built after we get married). That‚Äôs probably our biggest chunk of our expenses but we (she) don‚Äôt shop much. 

Now this is where I might be AITA. My family is poor ‚Äî all three of us kids didn‚Äôt go to college, we lived in government housing at some point in our childhood, etc. you get the drift. My sister works as a mechanic and my brother works in a fast food joint. Now mum was involved in something two years ago and won a lawsuit and got a couple of million as a settlement. Since then, she bought a house and promised to help us out. She‚Äôs given us each (her kids) $20,000 (February 2023), then $10,000 (July 2023), $5000 (April 2024) and another $5,000 two weeks ago. Majority of the money she gave, I contributed to me and my partner‚Äôs vacations and household expenses/purchases. My brother moved in with my mum and keeps her company in her new house.


Yesterday we all had dinner at mum‚Äôs. Since my brother lived there, he showed me his new $2,500 computer and he seemed really stoked. My gaming laptop conks out here and there due to overheating so my brother teased me to get a new one as well since he knows I just got money from mum too.

When we were at the dinner table, my brother said something about me getting a new computer again and without thinking, I turned to my partner and joked and said, ‚Äúwell now you know what you can get me for Christmas.‚Äù 

I can‚Äôt remember who spoke first but my brother and sister both said I can afford it so no need to ask for such an expensive gift. My idiot brain decided to reply with, ‚Äúmy fianc√© earns $40k a month, $2k is nothing to her.‚Äù As soon as I said it, the table went silent and I felt my fiance froze. My sister broke the silence and was very much WTF and asked if it‚Äôs true. My poor fiance does not know how to lie and was prodded to give more details about her personal finances. I tried to change subjects but no one was letting it drop. She basically had to explain that she earns an obscene $850k annually. Basically in the last four years, the company that she works for has grown 300% due to her direct efforts hence getting the pay bumps. She is basically attached to the hip with the owner. So in the last few years, I kid you not ‚Äî she jumped from $180k to $300k to $600k base pay then bonuses that can make her total annual up to 850k (which is what she got in 2023 and looking good to net that as well this year). It‚Äôs a very new income level for her so it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs a multi millionaire (yet).

And to defend myself, we have given expensive gifts to each other before. She has given me a PS5, really expensive leather boots, etc. and I have given her an iPad Pro, Apple Watch, and more so it‚Äôs not too impossible to be gifted something in the thousands. It‚Äôs not like that all the time and we take delight even with simple gifts. For my last birthday, she got me a funny shirt that I love that probably cost $15.

My brother and sister pulled me aside after dinner and said I was the greediest person they‚Äôve ever met for accepting mum‚Äôs cash gifts when my partner is so loaded. I said to them her money is not my money and we‚Äôre saving up for a wedding and a house so mum‚Äôs gifts are helping.

They countered by saying it‚Äôs not really logical since technically it‚Äôs mum‚Äôs contribution then and not mine.

36,1gjd3sy,AITA because I'm furious with my Mum,"It's always just need me (30F) and my Mum. She's always protective and has a lot of opinions. If you have a conversation with her, she forces her opinions on you and gets irate. Plus if I ever tell her how I'm feeling about things she has done or said she turns it back around on me.

I could speak to her calmly and respectfully and she says 'are you due on your period?' 'Are you pissed off and that's why you're starting with me'

I would say she is a functioning alcoholic. She gets home from work and has a bottle of wine most nights. She changes after it, she causes arguments for the sake of it, makes controversial, bitter or personal comments. Whenever I bring up the drinking she cuts me off, puts the phone down or shouts me at that she can do what she wants.

I have forgiven behaviours everytime and I am not perfect I will argue with her.

I had a child 3 months ago and myself and my partner told our parents very early into my pregnancy that we wanted to have space after our baby was born, a week or so bubble. Inlaws understood this, no issues. My mum didn't like that we wanted this. I told her it wasn't that I didn't love and appreciate her but it was the one time I would get to do this. She expected that she would be in the hospital with me... I said no to this too and she said she would be there anyway and when I forced the point I did not want her there she got upset and cried. She was not there in the end but she pestered me via text all night when I was in the hospital after the birth and asked hourly when I would be going home so she could come and meet baby. In the end I gave up just told her to come so it would get it done. 

She texted me alot during the first nights arguing that I was not replying enough.

I feel bitter. 

She always wanted to give me away when I get married, but I want to walk myself. She got upset about this too. I apologised and told her she could.

Recently, she stayed at my house to babysit. I had my first night out with my partner since baby was born. I returned after a few hours. she asked if we had any alcohol in the house. I said we didn't (purposely) so she asked where the nearest shop was. I had wine so I offered her that as it was one glass worth and thought it would be it but she again asked about the shop so she then went online onto uber and ordered one. I was furious, I do not want to be around her when she drinks and she knows it. I asked her not to order as she was doing it, she pretended not to hear me. I asked to take it home but she said no she will drink it and she did have some. 

When I tried to speak to her about this at the time she told me not to do this in front of my child and said I was ruining the night. I felt like a child again asking her not to drink. Difference is I'm 30 years old. I tried to say my house my rules and put that boundary in but wasn't strong enough in the moment. She would not have pushed if my partner was home

41,1gjbrxb,AITA for not throwing my sister a baby shower,"
My youngest sister is 6 months pregnant and I just found out about the baby. Yes, you read that correctly. She just told me, my other sister and my parents about her pregnancy, meanwhile the baby daddy‚Äôs family has known as long as she has known. 

My feelings are extremely hurt, seeing as I talk to her almost everyday. Granted, she lives two and a half hours away and I haven‚Äôt seen her in person for almost a year and half, I still feel like this is something that she should have filled my other sister and I in on. 

The baby daddy‚Äôs sister is planning a baby shower but has failed to reach out to anyone on my side of the family. My other sister feels it‚Äôs her‚Äôs and I‚Äôd responsibility to throw a shower, which I agree. But when we approached the pregnant lady about wanting to throw her a shower for at least our family, she acted uninterested in the idea. 

I sat and thought about it for a day and realized there is so much that goes into a baby shower, logistically, emotionally and financially. With her due date in late January, the only realistic time to have it is in mid November, which is now. But we have nothing. No venue, no decor, no food, no theme. Nothing. 

Since I‚Äôve voiced my opinions on all of this to both of my sisters, they‚Äôve turned cold and bitter to me, saying how I just don‚Äôt want to find time or the funds for this baby shower. Which is very untrue, I‚Äôm just trying to be realistic on the whole matter. 

I love both of my sisters to death and I would do anything for them, I just don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible to plan an event this large when I work 80 hour weeks and my other sister works a night shift. 

As far as doing a joint shower with his side of the family, my pregnant sister refuses to entertain that idea, saying there‚Äôs a language barrier and other nonsense. 

How do I approach this? How do I keep the peace and still show my sister support? ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-04,"AITA for not throwing my sister a baby shower

My granma will not change the date, and i will not spend time and money on cookies just so they all can sit and relax, and just do nothing? While i bake for 5 households, they  can‚Äôt even remember to bring a cookie jar every year.
So will i be the a-hole for saying no, i don‚Äôt want to bake the cookies? When granma don‚Äôt want to chance the date so i can be there?

I don't touch her stuff, she doesn't touch mine (or so I thought). Until.... I ran out of micelar water and replaced it with another bottle, which cost me 25‚Ç¨ (it's a big bottle). I placed it on my side of the shelf that was the opposite side to where our shelf meets in the middle (so I rule out her trying to reach for something that's on her side and accidentally knocking the bottle over). I barely got to use it, and a couple of days ago I came back to our room to find that bottle missing a cap.

Keep in mind, the bottle is big, so I planned on using it for at least several months, therefore I'll have to bring that same bottle home somehow. I asked her to replace the bottle for me and she's insisting that she didn't touch it. I said that okay, then probably somebody you brought over (I have no clue if she did) broke it and could you please still replace it for me.

Because we're in Canada, our health care system can be pretty slow at times so getting looked at can take hours.

About two and a half hours in, I was starting to panic really bad. So much so that a nurse who had seen what was going on came over and offered my boyfriend and I our own room so I could have space to breathe. I agreed and the nurse lead us to our room. I was starting to feel better when not even 5 minutes after getting in that room, someone in the hallway started vomiting profusely. Like projectile vomit everywhere. I tried blocking out the sound with some music but even at full volume I could still hear it. My boyfriend was trying to calm me down but it was too late. I was full on breaking down. Tears were rolling down my face and all I wanted was to go home. In the moment I was unsure whether or not my thoughts were irrational, so I called up a couple of friends to ask their opinions. They all agreed that it would be really bad if I left so instead I ended up just stepping outside for 10 minutes and then going back in.

My boyfriend ended up being okay in the end and I managed to stay calm the rest of the time. I wish my story ended there but the next day I got a phone call from my friends (lets call them Peter and Jason).

I felt genuinely bad about the whole thing so I called my boyfriend and apologized for everything. He told me that he was super confused as to why I was sorry and I explained to him what had been said to me.

48,1gj9a66,"AITA for ""leaving the herd"" when trying shrooms with my friend and her girlfriend?","I (20F) made a friend (Amb, 26F) at college. She's a sweetheart and fun hang. We were gonna study/paint, and Amb had agreed to drive me home as long as my partner (Jay, 24M) dropped me off. Amb lives with her partner Alex (30F). 1 hour in Amb says she feels like doing shrooms. I've never had them before, but I'm down to try them. So we have shrooms around 6 PM. They said I could stay the night if I wanted to.



\~9:30, I'm tired and want to head home. I ask if it's okay if I want to sleep in my bed tonight, Amb says that makes sense. Alex says I need to ""stay with the herd"" since it's my first time, so I agree to stay a little longer and we paint. I text Jay to pick me up cause we live about 30 minutes away in good traffic.



10:15 Jay shows up. I tell my friends I'm gonna pack my stuff and go. Amb helps pack my things, but Alex says to bring him inside. Alex immediately offers him chocolate and he accepts. When she walked out to get it, I told him what was in it. Jay refuses. I go finish packing.



Alex followed me asking why Jay didn't want any chocolate. I said I told him that it had shrooms, but she said he I shouldn't be making decisions for him. She went to talk to him.



Amb came into the kitchen to ask if I was okay. I said I was worried about leaving.

Alex says that me and Jay are codependent and he needs to be a free spirit. He says I can leave if I want. He keeps comforting me and Alex shushes him. Jay looks over to ask if I'm ready to leave (yes). He helps me up off the couch and I grab my backpack/purse. Alex grabs his arm to try to get him to sit back down. He pulls his arm away and tells her NOT to touch us. Jay yells that she's been disrespecting me all night and I don't have to stay. Amb then grabs Alex's arm to pull her back as it turns into a screaming match.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-04,"AITA for ""leaving the herd"" when trying shrooms with my friend and her girlfriend? I (20F) made a friend (Amb, 26F) at college. She's a sweetheart and fun hang. We were gonna study/paint, and Amb had agreed to drive me home as long as my partner (Jay, 24M) dropped me off. Amb lives with her partner Alex (30F). 1 hour in Amb says she feels like doing shrooms. I've never had them before, but I'm down to try them. So we have shrooms around 6 PM. They said I could stay the night if I wanted to.



\~9:30, I'm tired and want to head home. I ask if it's okay if I want to sleep in my bed tonight, Amb says that makes sense. Alex says I need to ""stay with the herd"" since it's my first time, so I agree to stay a little longer and we paint. I text Jay to pick me up cause we live about 30 minutes away in good traffic.



10:15 Jay shows up. I tell my friends I'm gonna pack my stuff and go. Amb helps pack my things, but Alex says to bring him inside. Alex immediately offers him chocolate and he accepts. When she walked out to get it, I told him what was in it. Jay refuses. I go finish packing.



Alex followed me asking why Jay didn't want any chocolate. I said I told him that it had shrooms, but she said he I shouldn't be making decisions for him. She went to talk to him.

Three years ago, I told them I was getting married. Their issue wasn‚Äôt with me marrying young but that I had chosen my spouse instead of letting them arrange the marriage. I had always been the ""golden child,"" so this was hard for them to accept.

Since then, they‚Äôve been emotionally abusive, constantly criticizing me, my husband (26M), and his family. They exclude my husband from family events, which is especially hurtful because he‚Äôs a kind and respectful man who doesn‚Äôt deserve this treatment.

Earlier this year, during a week-long visit for a religious holiday, my husband and I stayed at my parents' house. One morning, my husband slept in for 30 minutes past my mom's ""mandatory"" wake-up time because the maid needed to clean the room. When my mom asked me to wake him, I agreed but explained he needed rest due to his demanding job and offered to clean the room myself. She didn‚Äôt like me defending him and was curt with me for the rest of the morning.

Later, as we were getting ready to leave the house, I noticed my mom standing outside our room. She questioned why the door was locked. I explained that my husband had just showered and didn‚Äôt want anyone walking in. This led to a massive argument. She yelled about how poorly my husband was raised, insulted his parents, and even admitted to taking pictures of our room, claiming it was messy.

I told her her behavior was unacceptable and reminded her of her past mistreatment. My husband, overhearing the argument, packed our bags and said we were leaving.

It gets even worse with clothes. Whenever it came to clothes, she'd always buy and buy clothes for my sister and me. Of course, as a teenage girl, I love that. But am I throwing away clothes?

She had moved out of our area, but close enough to visit often & she planned to move back for college. Considering that I'm an introvert that had a previous bad experience with a prom date, I initially didn't want to do it. However, after some persuading, I resolved to ask her. I had known that C wanted to get into our prom the year before to see friends, I tried to see if she wanted to do the same this year. Just to gauge her interests, I had a mutual friend of ours, L, ask her if she'd want to come to our prom. I later got an answer from mutual saying that C would want to come.

This is where the wheels start to fall off the wagon, both in this story and my life. I was super stressed with senior stuff, and I was getting major anxiety from the prospect of asking her. Since I didn't want to deal with added stress, I told my friend group that I'd be going to prom alone. Almost immediately, L messages me and tells me that I need to ask C and that she'd probably say yes. I explained my concerns, she agreed with me, and I thought that was that.

The issue came the Wednesday before the week of prom. A cousin of mine walked up to me talking about how happy she was that I was going to prom with my friend. As soon as I told her the situation, her face went white. She had heard that I was going to prom with C from C's sister-in-law. After some quick process-of-eliminating, I was almost certain that L had dropped the ball, and I was right. After C had gotten suspicious of L's questions (knowing her, they were definitely suspicious), she interrogated L until she told C that I was planning on asking her. I kind of blew up on L, but just tried to go on with life. I thought about asking C, but decided that it was too short-notice.

This lasted a week and a half, when I had the misfortune of talking to C's sister-in-law. She kept the conversation short and, according to my cousin and her boyfriend, flipped me off as soon as she left my view. Cousin begins to tell me that C had a pretty big crush on me, had already bought a dress that matched my tux, and had the full expectation that I would ask her, only for me to never do so. Since then, I've only been able to have short conversations with C, and it's really torn me up. My friends insist that I'm not in the wrong (L says that C isn't mad about it anymore, which I'm not sure I believe), but I still feel like I stood her up.

58,1gj6v2c,AITA For choosing my uncle's funeral over a trip to niagra with my S/O,"Hey guys, I hate posting on here because I really wish it didn't have to be this way. I just got broken up with because I made a huge mistake, and I just wanted to find out if I'm the one wholly in the wrong.

It started a few months ago, my gf of 1 year and I both wanted to plan a trip for my birthday. But around a week ago, about a week away from my birthday. My uncle died. And it really took a toll on me, so the trip her and I planned was pretty much cancelled until we postponed the funeral because of some complicated reasons I don't particularly know about. 

But the problem is he's in Australia, and I live in West Virginia. And my family from scotland whom I've never met are traveling in to attend the funeral, and they are trying their best to schedule it around me. As they have wanted to meet me for some time, but my (gf At the time) got extremely pissed at me because I apparently ""chose"" them over her.

So as things progressed with me going to Australia, she got a bit better about it. She didn't support me when he died, but she was less persistent to talk about it. So we tried to plan something with the time we had before I went to Australia, and we chose to go to niagra.

This whole thing happened so fast that last Monday he died, and this Friday we were supposed to go. But we were to arrive the day before my flight to Australia. And that's a 30 hour trip. And my gf can't drive. So I would have to drive from wv to niagra, then back, and then the day after go on a 30 hour trip.

So today I was out with my family for a birthday dinner since I work on my actual birthday, and she called me in the middle of it to ask if she should book the hotel for niagra. In which I told her yes she should. 

And that's the mistake I made, because I really haven't been in a good mindset, with her threatening to leave me over going there or not. And a bunch of other stuff, so I thought I could pull that off. So I told her yes. There no excuse for that. I understand. Because later tonight I called my dad, and let him know what was going on, and he said that that's so strenuous on me that he didn't think I could do it. So he advised me against it.

I tried to talk to her and explain that I just physically couldn't do that many hours and that I wanted to plan something smaller so we could do something but not the niagra trip. And maybe save that for a day where I'm not so stressed. But she wouldn't budge. And she refused to refund it, and said why would I choose them over her, and all of that. And then broke up with me.

60,1gj6ksn,AITA For prying in my nephew's Private life?,"I (F 56) love my nephew (M 29) but his mother (F 60) makes me insane and currently has me wondering AITA. 
She is my older sister and my nephew has been living with her since his relationship exploded January of 23. 
She called me for my birthday in October and let drop that my nephew can't find his son because his ex moved and didn't tell him not only that she was going but where she was going. 
Of course this breaks my heart. As I said, I love my nephew. 
Earlier this weekend my adopted daughter and I were talking and we decided to try and find his ex. My daughter does pay services for skip Trace in order to keep track of her biological mother so she has resources and experience finding people.
As far as we know we were successful and I sent my sister a text wanting to know if they wanted that information. While my daughter just went ahead and sent what she found to her cousin. 
It was late Friday night so my sister didn't get the text until Saturday morning and at that time she started out texting yes she wanted the information, but almost immediately she went to NO, we don't want any information that YOUR ADOPTED DAUGHTER dug up and we probably already have that information and that is my nephew's PRIVATE LIFE and how DARE I stick my nose where it doesn't belong.
Okay, so that was not the response I expected. 
I sent her a text response starting with did she get up on the wrong side of the bed and I was just trying to help and I wouldn't have known anything about the situation if she hadn't told me. 
The text went on to say thank you for the phone call on my birthday it really did mean a lot, and I'm sorry that this was the response I got from her for trying to help my nephew. 
A couple hours later she sent me a message to just leave her family alone and this is where I may have become the AH. 
Needless to say, I did not take her text well. 
I made four posts one right after the other the first one was it's my family too b****. 
Next I went on to say I wouldn't know anything about the situation if my sister would have kept her mouth shut about it.
Then I texted her I was done, I was out, and I guess I would see her at our mother's funeral. 
So my two sisters talk a lot and they have a tendency to take whatever I did to my mother who is 82 and trying to involve her, so my final text message was that they needed to leave Mom out of it she didn't need the fkn stress and I wasn't nice about it. 
So I guess what my question is AM I THE A HOLE for digging in my nephew's Private life by trying to find his ex and his son (because he hasn't even been able to get custody, visitation, child support, or anything legally set up regarding his 7 year old son because they couldn't find him) even though this might get his hopes up and break his heart which I think is what my sister is worried about.

62,1gj6hn3,AITA for being a strict parent to my cat,"My roommate (M24) and I (M23) recently got into a disagreement as we have different philosophies on how to treat our cats. He currently has a 5 year old male cat and I have a ~5 month old female cat

He has always been very empathetic towards his cats and I would say that he spoils them. For example, he gives his cat treats daily and will spread catnip onto the floor for no reason other than his cat likes it (consequently  his cat has gotten a bit fat). On the other hand, I'm very selective with when and how I give my cat treats. Also, I don't allow my cat onto my bed (because she has peed on it twice, while I was going to sleep). He sees not allowing a cat onto the bed as blasphemy (his words). I told him how my parents taught their cat to stay in their laundry room at nights and he was horrified to hear that.

His philosophy is that cats should be allowed to roam wherever they like and our job is to make them as happy as possible limiting that in anyway is borderline inhumane. My philosophy is that having a cat is a transactional relationship. They get food, water, shelter, and pets/snuggles; we get to have a cute soft little baby to hang out with. I don't think cats really give two shits about their humans (not like how we care about them), they just seem to because they want what we provide.

The disagreement arose because my cat was recently fixed and had to stay in my room with a cone for almost two weeks recovering and being watched over. She got her stitches out the other day and cone off, but I haven't let her leave my room quite yet as I wanted to continue keeping an eye on her to make sure she wasn't licking her wound too much, and adjusting well to the new collar I put around her neck. He disagreed with this decision, and wants me to let her roam around the house again. He believes that by keeping her in my room, she can't be truly fulfilled and happy and I'm ""keeping her prisoner.""

We also disagree on other things like whether they should have a collar on as inside cats and the aforementioned disagreement about allowing them on the bed. This incident just broke the camels back and caused him to confront me about our disagreements.

I should also note that my cat was found as a baby at my roommate's place of work, and he took care of her for a couple weeks before I moved in and took over as her parent. He cares about her, rightfully so.

There's also definitely an element of jealousy from me (which probably played into my decision to keep my cat in my room for longer). For work I have to leave the house everyday, while he works from home on some days. Due to this arrangement and the fact that he spoils the cats, my cat will often seem friendlier to him than me, which is frustrating for me. I also feel that because he disapproves of my cat parenting style, he enjoys when my cat goes to him over me and actively or subconsciously wants her to like him more than me.

AITA for keeping my cat in my room longer than necessary?

EDIT: In trying to portray both me and my roommate fairly, I may have made it seem like I don't care about my own cat. Make no mistake, I care for her very deeply and really enjoyed all the extra time we've spent together in my room recently. She loves being on my lap while I'm at my desk and I love petting her and cuddling with her as she's such a cute little baby! Maybe that played into my decision too, as I'm sad that I won't get to spend as much time with her when she's out and about again.

I think another of my frustrations is that my roommate seems to talk a big talk but not necessarily walk the walk. I've never seen him clean any of our litter boxes, and he'll often leave cat food bowls out in the middle of the floor at various stages of consumption",Asshole,2024-11-04,"AITA for being a strict parent to my cat My roommate (M24) and I (M23) recently got into a disagreement as we have different philosophies on how to treat our cats. He currently has a 5 year old male cat and I have a ~5 month old female cat

He has always been very empathetic towards his cats and I would say that he spoils them. For example, he gives his cat treats daily and will spread catnip onto the floor for no reason other than his cat likes it (consequently  his cat has gotten a bit fat). On the other hand, I'm very selective with when and how I give my cat treats. Also, I don't allow my cat onto my bed (because she has peed on it twice, while I was going to sleep). He sees not allowing a cat onto the bed as blasphemy (his words). I told him how my parents taught their cat to stay in their laundry room at nights and he was horrified to hear that.

His philosophy is that cats should be allowed to roam wherever they like and our job is to make them as happy as possible limiting that in anyway is borderline inhumane. My philosophy is that having a cat is a transactional relationship. They get food, water, shelter, and pets/snuggles; we get to have a cute soft little baby to hang out with. I don't think cats really give two shits about their humans (not like how we care about them), they just seem to because they want what we provide.

The disagreement arose because my cat was recently fixed and had to stay in my room with a cone for almost two weeks recovering and being watched over. She got her stitches out the other day and cone off, but I haven't let her leave my room quite yet as I wanted to continue keeping an eye on her to make sure she wasn't licking her wound too much, and adjusting well to the new collar I put around her neck. He disagreed with this decision, and wants me to let her roam around the house again. He believes that by keeping her in my room, she can't be truly fulfilled and happy and I'm ""keeping her prisoner.""

We also disagree on other things like whether they should have a collar on as inside cats and the aforementioned disagreement about allowing them on the bed. This incident just broke the camels back and caused him to confront me about our disagreements.

I should also note that my cat was found as a baby at my roommate's place of work, and he took care of her for a couple weeks before I moved in and took over as her parent. He cares about her, rightfully so.

There's also definitely an element of jealousy from me (which probably played into my decision to keep my cat in my room for longer). For work I have to leave the house everyday, while he works from home on some days. Due to this arrangement and the fact that he spoils the cats, my cat will often seem friendlier to him than me, which is frustrating for me. I also feel that because he disapproves of my cat parenting style, he enjoys when my cat goes to him over me and actively or subconsciously wants her to like him more than me.

AITA for keeping my cat in my room longer than necessary?

EDIT: In trying to portray both me and my roommate fairly, I may have made it seem like I don't care about my own cat. Make no mistake, I care for her very deeply and really enjoyed all the extra time we've spent together in my room recently. She loves being on my lap while I'm at my desk and I love petting her and cuddling with her as she's such a cute little baby! Maybe that played into my decision too, as I'm sad that I won't get to spend as much time with her when she's out and about again. I'm not mad at her or trying to punish her for anything, she's just a cat and couldn't understand that.

We recently changed internet providers and I set it up as it made more sense for me to pay. I have been paying for it for about 3 months now

We have opposite schedules so I do not regularly see my roommate. I reached out to her via text about a week ago asking for a portion of the internet as I've been paying it for the whole house. She asked for my email and there was no further discussion. This was last week. 

I followed up about 2 days later and she replied she hit her etransfer limit and will send it when it's reset. I waited another 2 days before telling her I have not recieved anything. This time, however, she ignored my message. 

Yesterday I decided to message her again explaining the situation, asking if she could afford the extra portion, and that we could work something between her, my mom, and I if she could not afford it. I asked what she would like to do. She still has not replied.

I've had other issues with her in the past, such as eating my stuff out of the fridge or not cleaning up after herself. While not relevant, it has me close to the breaking point. 

So, reddit WIBTA, if I changed the password and kicked her off the internet? Obviously, I'm paying the same amount either way, but I'm just getting frustrated at this point. I'd be open to negotiating afterwards as well.

Jumping right in- My partner and I own two homes. Our first one we bought right as COVID was kicking off at a cheap price and low rate. Golden handcuffs.

On the second day of the trip, i started feeling unwell and progressively got worse. It was also the same day that he had planned and prepaid for a buffet meal for us. 

Just an hour before the buffet meal, i was so incredibly unwell that i asked to take a short nap in the hotel. 30 mins later i got up with a crazy headache and temperature. Here‚Äôs the part i felt was my own fault. Instead of asking not to go for the meal, i waited for my husband to bring it up. When he didnt, i brought up my feelings to him about how it was quite disappointing that he saw how weak and unwell i was but still did not suggest it. At this point, he brought up that the buffet was already prepaid for. He is not a bad husband by any standards but he tends to downplay other people‚Äôs feelings and body conditions because he does that to himself. 

At this point, in my grogginess (i took some meds) and feeling a bit pressured as he kept hovering behind me, waiting for me to get ready, i suggested that we will go quickly and come back quickly to which he agreed. However after a while, i got really upset that he didn‚Äôt considered my condition more important than this buffet meal. Once we were there, there was hardly anything i could keep down as it was all luxury and lavish food (think wagyu and sashimi). 

Ever since then, he has been extremely apologetic but i honestly have been giving him the cold treatment because i cannot bring myself to talk to him. 

I feel i may be an asshole because i brought it upon myself in a way and should have stood up for myself and rejected to go in the first place. 

Edit to add: hi all thanks for taking the time to comment and give your advises. Perhaps i forgot to add this which makes alot of you think i was treating him coldly all of a sudden but i have been telling him how unwell i have been the entire day, even vomiting and running to the toilet with diarrhoea multiple times. The reason why i was also so quick to react this way was because it is not the first time that it ‚Äúslipped his mind‚Äù that i was unwell. Therefore i mentioned in the end that i only felt that i may be an asshole because i should have rejected to go. Nonetheless, i obviously still wanted my husband to care for me and prioritised me when i was this unwell. However i do appreciate the comments even though many of them come off quite nasty (especially the one about my husband being a psychic - who made you like that!! i hope you get the same kind of response anytime you face an issue and tried to get advice.)",Asshole,2024-11-04,"AITA for giving my husband the cold shoulder for a long time while on a trip For context, my (33F) husband (34M) are currently on a 5 day trip without our son (1.5, M) to relax and reconnect. On the second day of the trip, i started feeling unwell and progressively got worse. It was also the same day that he had planned and prepaid for a buffet meal for us. 

Just an hour before the buffet meal, i was so incredibly unwell that i asked to take a short nap in the hotel. 30 mins later i got up with a crazy headache and temperature. Here‚Äôs the part i felt was my own fault. Instead of asking not to go for the meal, i waited for my husband to bring it up. When he didnt, i brought up my feelings to him about how it was quite disappointing that he saw how weak and unwell i was but still did not suggest it. At this point, he brought up that the buffet was already prepaid for. He is not a bad husband by any standards but he tends to downplay other people‚Äôs feelings and body conditions because he does that to himself. 

At this point, in my grogginess (i took some meds) and feeling a bit pressured as he kept hovering behind me, waiting for me to get ready, i suggested that we will go quickly and come back quickly to which he agreed. However after a while, i got really upset that he didn‚Äôt considered my condition more important than this buffet meal. Once we were there, there was hardly anything i could keep down as it was all luxury and lavish food (think wagyu and sashimi). 

Ever since then, he has been extremely apologetic but i honestly have been giving him the cold treatment because i cannot bring myself to talk to him. 

I feel i may be an asshole because i brought it upon myself in a way and should have stood up for myself and rejected to go in the first place. 

Edit to add: hi all thanks for taking the time to comment and give your advises. Perhaps i forgot to add this which makes alot of you think i was treating him coldly all of a sudden but i have been telling him how unwell i have been the entire day, even vomiting and running to the toilet with diarrhoea multiple times. The reason why i was also so quick to react this way was because it is not the first time that it ‚Äúslipped his mind‚Äù that i was unwell. Therefore i mentioned in the end that i only felt that i may be an asshole because i should have rejected to go. Nonetheless, i obviously still wanted my husband to care for me and prioritised me when i was this unwell. However i do appreciate the comments even though many of them come off quite nasty (especially the one about my husband being a psychic - who made you like that!! i hope you get the same kind of response anytime you face an issue and tried to get advice.)",1.0,1.0282409191131592,1,1
74,1gj54qi,AITAH for blocking my niece in n Facebook?,"AITAH for blocking my niece?

My 40 YO niece and I love each other. Sadly, her Dad (my brother) is estranged from half the family due to BS. I last saw her about 1.5 years ago. 

She commented on an old Facebook post that I had made after a family party, how she missed the way things used to be.  The comment then threw blame at me, talked down my familial values, downplayed the situation, and had choice words about how my religion believes in forgiveness so I am basically a hypocrite. 

I don‚Äôt throw shade on people, or withhold forgiveness. However, I distanced myself from my brother without closure, due to being under extreme duress. The broken family bothers me endlessly.

I decided to call my niece and express how the comment affected me. Maybe she was hacked. It seemed uncharacteristically hurtful. She met me with indifference, suggesting that I was accusing her of posting it challenging me to prove it was her. I said I am not accusing you, maybe you were hacked. I don‚Äôt know, but I asked that she delete the comment. I explained how my life sucks and I cannot handle extra drama . I told her I was sorry if I had hurt her. Something was clearly wrong with how history has failed to play out between us. She did not offer an apology. She begrudgenly deleted the comment after chastising me for ‚Äúdeciding to get upset about it‚Äù. Unfortunately I also raised concern that I may be in danger of hurting myself. Not like I was in imminent danger, more like how my life feels like it is over and having dirt kicked in my Facebook felt unwarranted.

So the call ends and she sends the police to my house. Ok fine, I understand that is their job and they stayed a couple hours until they decided I was safe. But she also started calling loved ones sending them in a panic that I was in immediate danger and a couple even raced over here helter skelter worried about me. Then she unfriended me. This is really hard but I still feel like calling her was the right move, rather than pretend the comment wasn‚Äôt posted or letting it linger while unhappiness festered. Im afraid the bridge was already burned before she picked up the phone.

He has been arguing with me a lot lately and getting angry at some things. I'll tell him to do something and he'll get annoyed or I tell him ""oh hey do this instead"" he'll get annoyed. If I remember all the arguments I'll write them down. 

Our current argument is about wifi

We are staying at a place momentarily and the host told us that we are sharing Wi-Fi with the person who lives next door. Since the Wi-Fi is Kind of slow and the person next door seems to work from home. I told my brother to not use it since if all three of us use it. Mostly likely will majorly slow down. I want to be considerate of the next door neighbor. He than get mad saying that I'm limiting him. I told him it's just this once because speed obviously isn't that high. He than argues that he always sees me on social media watching video which's takes up a lot of speed. This is not true at all. I told him I don't have rarely watched videos. Than he continue to argue it's not fair and mumbing under his breath calling me names. I told him it's only for the time that we are here and he can live without Wi-Fi. He than says that if roles were revered that I wouldn't have stand for it. Again not sure why he is getting so angry and I told him there is public Wi-Fi in many places near us. He than says would you like to go outside constantly ""no right""... by the way he isn't working and has no obligations for him to need the Wi-Fi. So am I the asshold for telling him to just wait for the next place we are heading to as we both will be able to use the Wi-Fi since it will be high speed. Let me know if I'm in the wrong...

78,1gj4jn7,AITA for allowing my daughter to use the bathroom before my partner showers after work? ,"Let me set the scene (editted spelling, my bad). It is 6am my partner(45M) and I (33F) are chatting in the kitchen as they have recently come home from a 12 hour night shift in manufacturing. My partner was telling me their plan to shower and get to bed quickly this morning. As we are talking my daughter (7) wakes up and heads to the bathroom with the shower. We have a half bath in the basement away from the bedrooms. 

I say nothing to her. My partner comments that it is bullshit that I allowed her to do that. I state that she will only be a moment. She ends up taking less than 5 minutes, likely close to 3 tops. She goes back to bed and he hopes in the shower. While in the shower my partner remindes me we have talked about this before and they shouldn't have to bring it up. 

He believes that she should not be using the bathroom he needs to get ready for bed (or work) at any point during the time he will be in and out of it. I have been told I am inconsiderate for allowing her to get away with this behaviour. 

So, AITA for believing a quick trip to the bathroom is reasonable? 

Edit to add:

We got into a large fight over the situation. I told him it was not a big deal that she took a quick pee. He thinks it is inconsiderate that he was not asked if he needed the bathroom before she went in. He always asks us if we need the bathroom beforehand (even with the fact there is a half bathroom in the basement). To him it's not that she used the bathroom it's that we are both inconsiderate of not finding out anyone else needs it first. I think that should only apply to using the shower.

Dan and I know each other but we never hang out if not with Andrew together.

Now it happened that Dan had taken me in the apartment as discussed, and then also another person Eric in a similar situation. Then Dan expressed needing more rent money to be paid which I thought was a bit steep.

I decided to bring this up with Andrew over text, expressing that I feel weird about what this other person and I are paying. Andrew responded with laughing, joking about Dan making money. I responded saying that ""I'm planning to just not pay the next half of the month to make it fair"".

Andrew took this to mean a conspiracy plot which I denied and said I will just bring it up. Andrew trying to argue that I have to pay whatever is asked, annoyed me enough to respond by saying ""no this is illegal subletting and I could report it"".

Next thing I know is I get yelled at out of nowhere by Dan and it only escalates further from here. It looks like Andrew has used these texts to make it look like he's saving Dan from a mean conspiracy.

**AITA for discussing it with Andrew first, and getting annoyed like this?**

**AITA for not taking the blame for this conspiracy and wanting a full apology from Andrew?**

Some nuances:

Apparently Andrew only meant to make fun of the third person Eric, who didn't have his private bedroom (but was also paying less) while I was actually supposed to be very grateful for having a room.

Now Andrew and Dan want to talk like I forced this upon them with a sob story of losing my house but I don't think I did. I think Dan was struggling to afford this house alone for the last half year (as a student with no income) and Andrew felt bad for leaving Dan alone with it.

Andrew says he was ""having Dan's back"". But I call this pretend-savior stuff lying, even if it is only forwarding texts including my own. I don't know exactly what was sent.

Dan says I ""took his kindness for granted"". It looked to me in the moment more like Dan is only using this as a convenient excuse to yell at me, because a lot of other stuff came out about how he ""already knew"" that my ""personality is trash"" because he had ""already heard things"". (no idea)

For context, I was sort of in a relationship with the lead singer, who we will call ""Alex"", that didn't last long and did not end well, but we are on good terms now. Or so I thought.

At a band practice, Alex showed us some lyrics for a new song that they had been working on. Usually their lyrics are really cool and creative, but this new song felt a bit off. Some of the lyrics felt very similar to things I had said in the aftermath of our break up and the way that they talked about whoever the song was addressed to felt very negative.

Alex had had crushes on people that I knew about and openly flirted with them and others in our DnD group, but I couldn't shake the feeling that the song was about me. I asked if we could talk after practice and I pulled them aside into a separate room. I asked them if the song was about me and they looked at me with an annoyed expression and denied it. I asked who it was about and they said a friend of ours, who we will call ""Jacob.""

I don't like Jacob, and I noticed that he had been doing some creepy things to Alex that matched up with the lyrics. but I couldn't shake the feeling that this was a cover story, and the lyrics were still about me.

Then he told me something that shocked me. George had told Alex about some creepy things that Jacob had said about Alex, and he had to stop them from physically confronting Jacob. After hearing this, I was convinced that the song was not about me.

This changed at the next band practice. Alex showed us the newest verse and asked us what we thought. I said that I thought that the lyrics were too harsh to the person they were addressed to and that Alex should consider peoples feelings when writing songs. Alex got a bit teary eyed, and my brother (who is the bassist), took them outside. The other members were silent and we could hear Alex crying outside as my brother comforted them.

88,1gj34rg,AITA for telling someone not to talk about babies in a certain way?,"In my partner‚Äôs friend group from university, they are all each other‚Äôs sole support system in a new country. Like when dealing with grief or break ups or losing jobs or moving. They all have their quirks and annoying habits that the others deal with for the sake of friendship. Recently, two of us couples in the group had babies and the rest are all single and childfree.

But there‚Äôs this one guy (Chu) who often says weird and bothersome stuff about our babies. Like he would jokingly say ‚Äúis your baby in a good mood today or fussy as usual?‚Äù, or make a comment like ‚ÄúYour baby takes so much milk‚Äù or ‚Äúyour baby cries a lot!‚Äù etc. Thing is, both our babies are quite calm and have never bothered anyone, so naturally none of us 4 parents like these comments or find it funny. And this has been happening for almost a year now. Typically, the father of the other baby stays quiet because Chu is ‚Äújust like that‚Äù. The other baby‚Äôs mom sometimes ignores and sometimes retorts with a sarcastic taunt, but laughingly to soften the blow. My partner does the same. I have, until now, always stayed quiet and ignored Chu.

But at a recent group dinner, Chu‚Äôs comments got to me. But i wanted to react nicely and explain my thoughts. I said to him ‚ÄúYou know how you use superlatives and generalisations with our babies, ‚Äòlike that‚Äôs so much food for a baby‚Äô or ‚Äòyour baby is always so fussy‚Äô I would appreciate it if you didn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù In reaction, Chu made a face but stayed quiet and then burst out in a defensive monologue. The gist was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm like this and i don‚Äôt change for anybody. I don‚Äôt take advice from anyone about what i should say and do. I don‚Äôt even care about your babies at all, I just joke and say anything at all to make you guys happy. I‚Äôm never say or do anything for your babies anymore.‚Äù My partner‚Äôs first reaction was to stand in my defence and tell Chu off. To which Chu continued his rant. We calmed them both down in a minute or so. I was okay and my partner first made sure of that. After which the rest of the 3 parents coddled Chu like he‚Äôs a toddler throwing a tantrum. Things quickly got happy and lively again. Even Chu came around after an hour or so of coddling, and the evening ended on a happy and slightly awkward note.

While my intent was to kindly set a boundary, but Chu‚Äôs reaction made me wonder if I was rude. I honestly thought I didn‚Äôt wanna use sarcasm and taunts. But now i‚Äôm confused because Chu has never even reacted to that when my partner and the other mom do that. I‚Äôm also worried that I cost my partner a friend. But he assured me that he is glad at least Chu will mince his words now and he is 100% on my side because Chu has a history of such tantrum throwing and poking people with inappropriate comments just to get a reaction and grab attention.

And this has been happening for almost a year now. Typically, the father of the other baby stays quiet because Chu is ‚Äújust like that‚Äù. The other baby‚Äôs mom sometimes ignores and sometimes retorts with a sarcastic taunt, but laughingly to soften the blow. My partner does the same. I have, until now, always stayed quiet and ignored Chu.

But at a recent group dinner, Chu‚Äôs comments got to me. But i wanted to react nicely and explain my thoughts. I said to him ‚ÄúYou know how you use superlatives and generalisations with our babies, ‚Äòlike that‚Äôs so much food for a baby‚Äô or ‚Äòyour baby is always so fussy‚Äô I would appreciate it if you didn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù In reaction, Chu made a face but stayed quiet and then burst out in a defensive monologue. The gist was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm like this and i don‚Äôt change for anybody. I don‚Äôt take advice from anyone about what i should say and do. I don‚Äôt even care about your babies at all, I just joke and say anything at all to make you guys happy. I‚Äôm never say or do anything for your babies anymore.‚Äù My partner‚Äôs first reaction was to stand in my defence and tell Chu off. To which Chu continued his rant. We calmed them both down in a minute or so. I was okay and my partner first made sure of that. After which the rest of the 3 parents coddled Chu like he‚Äôs a toddler throwing a tantrum. Things quickly got happy and lively again. Even Chu came around after an hour or so of coddling, and the evening ended on a happy and slightly awkward note.

While my intent was to kindly set a boundary, but Chu‚Äôs reaction made me wonder if I was rude. I honestly thought I didn‚Äôt wanna use sarcasm and taunts. But now i‚Äôm confused because Chu has never even reacted to that when my partner and the other mom do that. I‚Äôm also worried that I cost my partner a friend. But he assured me that he is glad at least Chu will mince his words now and he is 100% on my side because Chu has a history of such tantrum throwing and poking people with inappropriate comments just to get a reaction and grab attention. But I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I made a mistake and I should have probably ignored Chu like always. So, AITA?",0.0,0.0156120946630835,0,1
89,1gj30bm,AITA for hooking my friend on a mobile game?,"So, around five years ago, I was playing this mobile game called HomeScapes. It was just something I did in my spare time on the bus to and from work, but eventually it started taking up more and more of my spare time, to the point where I was spending minimum an hour on it each day, and dropping around $50 on it a week.

I ran into a rough patch where I couldn't afford to keep spending on the game, and so I went free-to-play for a while, and I gradually lost interest in the game.

Fast forward to the beginning of this year, I had a friend approach me looking for game recommendations. I suggested HomeScapes, as it's genuinely a really fun game, and I think it was going fine for a while.

I didn't see him for a few months after that, and I didn't think much of it - we're college friends, not super close buddies.

However, some time in early June he approached me asking if he could couch surf for a few days because he had lost his job. I asked him why and he said that he had been coming late to work because he was spending an hour and a half each morning playing HomeScapes.

It sounded kind of close to my experience with the game, but he kept spending on it, apparently dropping over $100 each week (The money his parents gave him to get by when unemployed) on microtransactions.

Anyway, a few days turned into a few weeks, and those turned into months. He's now been in my house for half a year, and he's showing no signs of leaving. He spends most of his time on Homescapes.

My wife and son are of the opinion that I should stage an intervention or take him to rehab, but I don't think he would take it well, and I feel like a psychological addiction like this would be easier to just go cold turkey on than an actual drug addiction.

It just seems unfair that he is couchsurfing in my house, sucking up my money and time while he spends his on a mobile game.

I'm aware that addiction comes in many forms, and I want to be kind to him, but I went through a financial rough spot myself recently when I got scammed, and it's way harder to keep everything afloat when there's another adult in the house eating our food, because he's spending his money on the game.

I don't want him to throw his life away for a game - I know how close I came once, but I think he should be considerate of others and get his life in order as well. I just think he might need a short sharp shock to get him on his feet and stop his addiction, so WIBTA if I kicked him out of my house?

I might be the asshole because I did have a somewhat addictive experience with this game in the past, and I still recommended it to him. I do feel bad for recommending it to him, but I don't know how much of his addiction is my fault.",TL;DR,2024-11-04,"AITA for hooking my friend on a mobile game?

So the guy Ill be talking about is called S (18M). I remember that day I was quiet listening to music on my airpods just zoned out. Then he waved his hands in front of my face and just asked me normal questions, such as how was America and stuff (I was visiting my home country bangladesh). Then later he asked me a question, and the question was ‚ÄúDo you have a girlfriend?‚Äù. And I got annoyed because he asked a question like that. That question immediately brought back bad memories of me in middle school when I was being relentlessly bullied by kids for not having a girlfriend. I asked him why and he gave some corny answer about how ‚Äúhe heard kids in america are bad‚Äù. I was obviously annoyed by him and my cousin (18F) asked me did he offend me. I just told her that he was being weird and he overheard me calling him weird to my cousin. The guy kinda acted offended but was still in his annoying ‚Äúclass clown‚Äù persona. I remember before we left he was like ‚ÄúYou called me weird?‚Äù and ‚ÄúI hope you never get a girlfriend‚Äù. I just grey rocked him and didnt respond to his stupid shit.

So basically recently my cousin came over from bangladesh to visit america for two weeks. Today she invited over her friends who have recently migrated here. I was pretty reluctant on talking to them because I was still pissed at the action of that guy. I just sat in the living room and avoided even saying hi to them until they left. I was being told by my parents and my cousin that I should at least say hi to them. I did so anyways and saw three of them. I said hi to one of them and she asked me how I was. I said good but then I saw fucking S again. He was like ‚ÄúIm sorry for‚Ä¶.‚Äù (I forgot what he said later on) while smiling. I just closed my eyes and groaned and said ‚ÄúOh My God this kid again‚Ä¶.‚Äù. I could fucking tell that apology was fake and not genuine. I do not accept apologies that easily anymore because of how I have been treated in my developmental years in middle school. I often dealt with dipshits who would disrespect the fuck out of me and then be like ‚ÄúOh it was just jokes LOL!!!!!!!‚Äù and I would fucking accept it, making me a pushover. 

I told my mom and dad about this, and my mom was disappointed while my dad felt that I was in the right.

95,1gj204g,AITA for giving my honest opinion on food when asked for it?,"Our mother loved to cook. Maybe not every night, but most nights we‚Äôd have a delicious home cooked meal, made from scratch, just whatever she felt like throwing together. She‚Äôd go to the market and pick out whatever looked good and build an entire meal around that, and it was always delicious.

My oldest sister has inherited that passion, two or three times a month she‚Äôll cook for me, our other sister and a few of our friends. She loves to cook and can follow a recipe to a T. Her food usually comes out good, but she always asks how it is. I have always given my honest opinion, it‚Äôs good, but XYZ. Could use some salt, would be good with this cheese, is a little too spicy, etc. Also, her sense of smell is awful, she can‚Äôt smell petrichor, always has congestion, can‚Äôt pick out subtle notes in fragrances, to the point it‚Äôs a running joke among us. So, I thought nothing of it, she‚Äôs asking for my opinion and I‚Äôm giving her my feedback, ways to make it better for next time.

I didn‚Äôt realize she (people in general?) didn‚Äôt actually want my opinion until we were at one of her friends house, they made cookies from scratch and asked how it was, no one wanted to answer so I started my usual ‚ÄúIts good‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶‚Äù and my sister cut me off to interject ‚Äúoh, she always has something negative to say, don‚Äôt take it personally.‚Äù I was stunned, looking back, it wasn‚Äôt MY friend/sister cooking, and this person is a little sensitive, but they even said several times ‚ÄúI followed a recipe, if it‚Äôs bad it‚Äôs not my fault‚Äù. I was just going to give feedback, it wasn‚Äôt disgusting and even if it was I would never say that! Just give a ‚Äòhere‚Äôs what I would do different next time‚Äô.

But now every time my sister cooks she asks how it is and I‚Äôm afraid to give my honest opinion. So I‚Äôve been saying ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs good‚Äù and leaving it at that.

Until she made breakfast today and asked me what my complaint was. I‚Äôm sure she was joking but it was like a stab in the heart, I cried the whole way home. It‚Äôs at the point where I‚Äôm about to make up excuses to miss the meals so I don‚Äôt have to risk it. I haven‚Äôt talked to her about it, because I‚Äôm sure either she won‚Äôt see a problem with it, or she‚Äôll think I‚Äôm just being overly sensitive.

I would say I don‚Äôt know why it bothers me so much, but I get so annoyed when I ask how something (dessert, a party, or planned outing, something I took the time to plan or make) is and it‚Äôs always ‚Äúit‚Äôs good‚Äù with no notes. I want to know what you liked and didn‚Äôt like so I can make it even better next time!

TLDR, am I the asshole for giving my honest opinion on food when asked for it? And what the hell do I do moving forward?

My oldest sister has inherited that passion, two or three times a month she‚Äôll cook for me, our other sister and a few of our friends. She loves to cook and can follow a recipe to a T. Her food usually comes out good, but she always asks how it is. I have always given my honest opinion, it‚Äôs good, but XYZ. Could use some salt, would be good with this cheese, is a little too spicy, etc. Also, her sense of smell is awful, she can‚Äôt smell petrichor, always has congestion, can‚Äôt pick out subtle notes in fragrances, to the point it‚Äôs a running joke among us. So, I thought nothing of it, she‚Äôs asking for my opinion and I‚Äôm giving her my feedback, ways to make it better for next time.

I didn‚Äôt realize she (people in general?) didn‚Äôt actually want my opinion until we were at one of her friends house, they made cookies from scratch and asked how it was, no one wanted to answer so I started my usual ‚ÄúIts good‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶‚Äù and my sister cut me off to interject ‚Äúoh, she always has something negative to say, don‚Äôt take it personally.‚Äù I was stunned, looking back, it wasn‚Äôt MY friend/sister cooking, and this person is a little sensitive, but they even said several times ‚ÄúI followed a recipe, if it‚Äôs bad it‚Äôs not my fault‚Äù. I was just going to give feedback, it wasn‚Äôt disgusting and even if it was I would never say that! Just give a ‚Äòhere‚Äôs what I would do different next time‚Äô.

But now every time my sister cooks she asks how it is and I‚Äôm afraid to give my honest opinion. So I‚Äôve been saying ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs good‚Äù and leaving it at that.

Until she made breakfast today and asked me what my complaint was. I‚Äôm sure she was joking but it was like a stab in the heart, I cried the whole way home. It‚Äôs at the point where I‚Äôm about to make up excuses to miss the meals so I don‚Äôt have to risk it. I haven‚Äôt talked to her about it, because I‚Äôm sure either she won‚Äôt see a problem with it, or she‚Äôll think I‚Äôm just being overly sensitive.

I would say I don‚Äôt know why it bothers me so much, but I get so annoyed when I ask how something (dessert, a party, or planned outing, something I took the time to plan or make) is and it‚Äôs always ‚Äúit‚Äôs good‚Äù with no notes. I want to know what you liked and didn‚Äôt like so I can make it even better next time!

TLDR, am I the asshole for giving my honest opinion on food when asked for it? And what the hell do I do moving forward? Because I don‚Äôt want this reputation of being a complainer when it‚Äôs good food and I‚Äôm so grateful that she takes the time to cook for us.",1.0,0.053594060242176,0,0
96,1gj1rbj,AITA for telling my friend I won‚Äôt be getting her a present for her birthday and for Christmas?,"So my friend Jordan (27F) and I (27F) have our birthdays just days from each other (hers is the 26th, mine is the 30th of November) and we always discuss before our birthdays as to whether we want to exchange presents or not and we discuss budget limits.
Last year we agreed to do birthday presents and Christmas presents for each other with a max spending budget of 50$. And because her birthday is before mine I shop and plan first. I got her a 50$ gift card to her favourite store and she asked me to make her a birthday cake with a specific design and I did. She loved it.
My birthday came around and I got‚Ä¶. Nothing.
I didn‚Äôt let it bother me as she was telling me that it wasn‚Äôt ready yet and I decided to be patient.
Christmas comes around I made her an embroidery I did myself of a bunch of flowers. It took me a long time to make it but I was so proud of it and excited to give it to her. She loved that as well.
And I got‚Ä¶. Nothing. Again.
By then I felt confused and I tried asking about it and she said the same thing which is that she made me a painting but didn‚Äôt like it and had to start over but that she was working on it. So again, I decided to be patient.
I never saw either gift.
A few days ago, I sent her a message trying to suggest how about we don‚Äôt do gifts this year let‚Äôs just give each other a nice card. She said she didn‚Äôt want to do that she wanted us to exchange gifts again. I got upset admittedly and I confronted her about what happened last year, she apologized and said she wanted fo make it up to me and the reason she didn‚Äôt get me anything was because she was going through a hard time. I told her I needed to think about it because of what happened last year.
She messaged me today asking me to make her another birthday cake for her birthday, and I told her I didnt think I could commit to that this year and that I wasn‚Äôt interested in swapping gifts this year. She‚Äôs now really upset with me.
My husband thinks I have every right to not want to do presents this year and he finds it fishy how she has the attitude of ‚ÄúI know I didn‚Äôt get you gifts last year but let‚Äôs do then this year. You first!‚Äù 
One of our mutual friends thinks I should just push my ego aside and give her a gift because she‚Äôs had a hard year.
I feel like I should stop being selfish and just make her the damn cake because I don‚Äôt believe you should give a gift with the expectation of getting something in return. The other part of me doesn‚Äôt want to do it and feels some anger over her lying to me.

97,1gjt2if,WIBTA for dropping out of college?,"so i, 19F, live in a amicable roomate situation with my ex, 21M. this is important because i dont live at home with my parents, we live almost an hour apart. (45-50 minute drive).

iam a sophomore in college, and it's been messy. my freshman year i was at a different college in the far south of my state, almost 3 hours away from my hometown. i switched majors twice while there and i passed most of my classes, but they were easy classes where just showing up could get you an A. just before the end of my freshman year, something serious happened and i ended up leaving school early with accommodations from the accessibility center.  

my parents agreed to let me go to college closer to home, and i moved out just before the school year started. unfortunately, this school's disability center sucks. most of the staff are students, and they turn away most of the people who look for accommodations because they arent physically disabled or their conditions dont seem serious enough for immediate attention. i have debilitating ptsd and asked to have primarily online courses (which this college offers) and to participate in one on-campus class for my major (mortuary science) which requires one four hour lab a week. i was given these accommodations but they seemed to have fallen through because i needed to meet with one of the student staff to walk through it and they kept cancelling on me so they fell through. 

on top of all this i am just failing for a multitude of reasons and i just dont think college is for me for a lot of reasons id rather not delve into. also, my dad has veterans benifits so my college tuition was entirely paid for and all i paid for was class fees, which was like 200. 

im worried ill be the asshole because my parents really really really want me to finish college, like, a full four year program. they havent liked any of the majors i've gone for and keep pushing me to go into the medical field or radiology. they've also tried guilting me into going for bigger fields because they think i dont understand the ramifications of having a lower paying job or no bachelors' or associates degree. they also have this ""dont make my mistakes"" mindset because neither of them finished college and they both went into the military. i also have a rocky relationship with them for a LONG list of reasons. 

honestly, i just hate college and i still care about my parents but i know that if i drop out there's three ways they could respond, and either three of those ways im damaging the relationship i have with them and hurting them in a way. i also dont want my sisters to see me drop out and think of following my lead in not going, but they're smart enough that if i just talk to them about it they wouldn't. i've been thinking of dropping and not telling them for a few days until i figure out what to tell them, or i just tell them afterwards.

103,1gjrpod,AITA for taking a trip without my husband first?,"When my husband and I dated in 2020 we made a list of cities that we'd like to visit together. To be clear, I never agreed that we had to visit the cities together first before going any other time because I feel going as a couple an going with friends are different experiences. He feels, if I go before him then he doesn't want to go at all in the future.

During engagement, my bridal party asked where I want to so my bachelorette. I said NOLA or vegas (which is a city on the list). They went with vegas. My husband (fianc√© at the time) had a conniption. He said he expected us to go together first and did not ever want to go if I went before he. He ended up moving his bachelor activities from the city we live in to vegas to spite me (I feel).

Fast forward, a close friend of mine often celebrates her birthday with a girls trip. I usually go. This coming up year, she is doing Denver. I mentioned going to my husband this morning and an conniption ensued because it is in the ""list"" and we haven't gone yet (nor have plans to go btw).
I really need a girls trip and time away. My husband works retail hours so that leaves me with our 1 year old 3 evenings out the week by myself after I work as well and all day on weekends. So I rarely get a break...ever.

Our marriage is already on the rocks because of lack of connection over time together and emotional damage that occurred during my postpartum time when he behaved selfishly and basically left me to manage things on my own. I felt overwhelmed and abandoned for the first 6 months and still carry the bulk of the load. But now he is feeling a way because he's not getting any since I'm really not connected emotionally. So we've been struggling in marriage. He said he feels disrespect because I'm not considering hiw he feels about wanting to go first with me.

During our disagreement this morning, he stated that my friends are more important than him becausei wanted to go on the trip. I literally have not gathered with friends in MONTHS because I've been covering home duty. It's not a win for me either way though. Either I go and he has an attitude for however long or I stay and I still don't get a break.

Mind you, when we discussed trips in past he has said that he does not like to take off on weekends and we try to limit other off days because he doesn't get alot of them. So we don't really go places as often as I would like especially if we have an international trip the same year. When we do, I'm the one who brings it up and plans it. As a note, we are going to Florida next week for his friend's wedding and to LA (a city on the list) next may for my brother's wedding but also we are going a few days earlier to experience the city. We have been to DC first together a couple of years ago which was on the list.

Should I go to Denver? The future of my marriage may depend on my decision. I feel like I've lost myself and my happiness outside of my son.

So we've been struggling in marriage. He said he feels disrespect because I'm not considering hiw he feels about wanting to go first with me.

During our disagreement this morning, he stated that my friends are more important than him becausei wanted to go on the trip. I literally have not gathered with friends in MONTHS because I've been covering home duty. It's not a win for me either way though. Either I go and he has an attitude for however long or I stay and I still don't get a break.

Mind you, when we discussed trips in past he has said that he does not like to take off on weekends and we try to limit other off days because he doesn't get alot of them. So we don't really go places as often as I would like especially if we have an international trip the same year. When we do, I'm the one who brings it up and plans it. As a note, we are going to Florida next week for his friend's wedding and to LA (a city on the list) next may for my brother's wedding but also we are going a few days earlier to experience the city. We have been to DC first together a couple of years ago which was on the list.

Should I go to Denver? The future of my marriage may depend on my decision. I feel like I've lost myself and my happiness outside of my son. My whole life revolves around my son, working and doing this as my husband's schedule permits.",0.0,0.15378375351428986,0,1
104,1gjrhre,"AITA for, in my eyes, helping a friend out.","I (M18) had just finished high school last week and was on study leave. I was returning to the school 2 days after we had finished to pack down some of the sports and pe departments for the day, a few people also put up their hand to help and these people turned out to be some of my friends. 

I had arrived at 8:25am after getting dropped off by my grandfather (M68). About 5 minutes later I had read one of my groupchats where one of my friends had been asking for help as he was at a major bus station with no money or means of transportation. His options were to do the 2.5 hour walk to the school (he was one of the helpers) or to do the 3 hour walk home. 

He instead chose the third option which was to ask someone for help, I was the only one who had seen his text at the time so I offered my help, I bussed to him from my school which took roughly 30-40 minutes. We then bussed to a bus station that was further away as the busses directly back to the school weren't coming for a long time whereas the ones at the bus station further away were more frequent. As we were travelling along another friend saw the message and offered to pick him up, I told him to pick us up at this bus station as we were nearly there anyways plus it worked out better as he lives close by it.

He picks us up in his car and we head on to the school to do help out.

My grandmother (F64) seems to think I was out with 'friends' based solely on my bus card history and believes I lied about the day. She's now highly pissed off because of it and says ""I threw her trust away"" even though she won't simply hear me out or she'll make out to hear me out but is already thinking about her POV and what to say before I even start with mine.

It's lead to a shitty weekend and high tension in the household. She says I wasted her money (technically my grandfather's as she's a housewife) on helping a friend out which I think sounds so insane and selfish, like should we not help out friends in need these days.

105,1gjr6tx,AITA for telling my mom she disappointed me after she said I don‚Äôt care about her and that I disappointed her?,"I (25F) live with my mom (50F) and two younger brothers (23M and 21M). Last week, my mom, a nurse, stayed overnight working at the hospital for the 1st time for 2 days. On the 1st night, I texted her around 8 p.m to check in, but she just replied ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù I assumed she was tired or busy, so I didn‚Äôt press. I wanted to do something nice for her so I bought her an eyeshadow palette and left it on her bed.

The next night I texted her around 9 p.m but she didn‚Äôt respond. She came home 2 hours later, and I greeted her, but she seemed off, so I let it go. She acknowledged the gift I got her in a flat tone. The next day, she seemed distant, and when I asked if something was wrong, she told me she was hurt  I hadn‚Äôt called while she was away working. My middle brother had called, but my youngest brother and I hadn‚Äôt, which made her feel we didn‚Äôt care and left her worried about her future. She said that if I couldn‚Äôt bother to call her now, she‚Äôs afraid I won‚Äôt support her when she‚Äôs older.

I explained that I was unsure of her working schedule and thought she was potentially  working night shifts. My thinking was she would see my texts and call when free. She wasn't open to my reasoning and kept saying I should‚Äôve called. I felt frustrated because I‚Äôve always been good in reaching out to check on her. I reminded her of this though I mistakenly said she‚Äôd only called once whilst I was on holiday (I later realized she called more). She dismissed my point, saying she was disappointed in me and was genuinely afraid of not having caring children in her old age. 

Feeling hurt, I told her that I was disappointed in her too and left the room. I felt she was unfairly judging me based on one situation, despite my good communication on other occasions

Since then, we‚Äôve barely spoken. She eventually told me it was ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù for me to say she disappointed me, claiming I ‚Äústormed out‚Äù of the room (I left quietly). I pointed out that she disrespected me first by saying I disappointed her, but she said that, as my mom , she has the ‚Äúright to disrespect me.‚Äù She said she just accepts it when her own mother frustrates her, and I should do the same

She also brought out call logs from my trip to show she‚Äôd called me more than once, though most were returning my missed calls. She also accused me of avoiding her since the argument and said it it was fine by her. She then went on to say I ‚Äúlack emotional intelligence‚Äù and should ‚Äúsort myself out‚Äù before marriage. She warned that if I treated a future mother/sister-in-law this way, I‚Äôd ‚Äúmake my life miserable.‚Äù

Looking back, I regret talking back, as it escalated things. But I also feel it‚Äôs unfair that she expects me to accept her words without being able to say the same exact words back. If I didn‚Äôt care, I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten her a gift to surprise her before I knew she was upset nor would I have noticed/cared about her mood.

110,1gjqnxm,AITAH for putting kittens' wellbeing above an old lady's mental health? ,"In the area where I (32F) live there's an old lady (let's call her Martha) who is a bit mentally unwell, I met her at the pet shop buying food, she explained that she looked after a colony where someone dumped a bunch of cats and therefore the colony went from 4 neutered cats to 22 cats. I said I'd help her with TNR after I did some fundraising.

I then learnt from neighbours that the colony is actually a byproduct of Martha not spaying her own cats and at one stage 10 years ago there were 50 cats in the colony all inbred with health issues and someone poisoned a few of them because of the smell and this caused Martha a lot of mental health issues. Eventually cats got spayed and over the years the outside cats died out and there's only 4 left from the original ones. People know about this place so someone dumped 2 unwanted females there a year ago and now there's lots of cats once again.

I went over to do TNR and she told me she only wanted me to TNR the 3 mom cats who had already had litters as they got to experience motherhood. I explained it doesn't work that way.

There were 5 kittens who I thought were 3 weeks old because they were tiny. They were actually 6 weeks old as they were newborns when I met Martha the first time. I asked the rescue for help and they found a foster for the small kittens. When I spoke to Martha she started freaking out that I wanted to take the kittens so I said I wouldn't and left it alone. 2 weeks later I went back to TNR some more cats and the kittens had not grown at all. 


I explained to Martha that the kittens were way too small and I needed to take them to the vet and to the foster family. After talking for a while she started to agree with me, but once I actually caught the kittens and took them away she had a massive freak out and panic attack and told me I had betrayed her and kept saying to bring the kittens back to the colony.

Kittens were half the weight they were meant to be for their age, full of worms and ringworm. They are with an experienced foster now dewormed and on high calorie kitten food and kitten milk. They most likely would not have survived in the wild.

A few of my friends said that I am upsetting an old lady with bad mental health for some cats and am traumatising her. Also they said that the shelter could've just helped some other cats since they don't have resources to help every single cat and they could have just left these kittens alone so Martha wouldn't have been upset. I've honestly been feeling awful about myself and I don't know if I've done the right thing now after speaking to them.

I guess I know there's lots of kittens waiting to go into foster and I could have just told the foster team to take someone else in, I know that because the foster team took these kittens in there are kittens out there that won't get a spot but I wasn't really thinking about it in those terms.

I am normally the one who pays for these meals despite not having a job or source of money and iykyk, Dunkin is pretty expensive, so we normally go out only once or twice a month. My friend, Beth, is a lot more popular than I am. I mean if we hadn't been friends since elementary school, we wouldn't be friends now. Our friendgroups are completely different and I don't see her a lot because she is always doing something with someone. So our Dunkin trips probably seem like just another day for her while they are typically the highlight of my week. 

I recently have had the worst week of my life and planned a while ago to meet with Beth and talk to her about it. The day comes and she texts me in the middle of the school day asking if we can go after the football game. I say sure, she can just walk up to my house after it, and I also offer that we can go on Wednesday if she really wants. She says she will walk up to my house after the game. So I get home and I wait. An hour goes by and I text her asking what time she will come by. She says 6:30. Dunkin closes at 6:30. I tell her that and she explains that not only is she at the football game, but she promised multiple people that she would see the volleyball game too, and that starts at 6. So I got frustrated and asked her why she had to be at both. She didn't give me a real answer: ""Idk ppl asked me to"". So I told her to just forget about going to Dunkin with me, today or Wednesday, and she of course asked if I was upset, asked why not. I told her I wasn't upset, just annoyed. I declined her offer of going sometime else.

I understand that she is a very busy person. I'm very accepting of this. I've had to deal with feelings of being left out for years now. It hurts me that she throws our plans away so easily, and I know I offered that we could go on a whole different day, but that was before I found out she promised people she would go to games today. It hurts me that my time and money is less important than her friends and if I never messaged her she wouldn't have told me she made herself busy at all. I'm not in tears about this. I'm honestly just bummed and don't feel like talking about my week anymore, which makes me feel lonely again. 

And then on her side, I made the offer to go on a different day. Nothing was out of the ordinary from her perspective and I guess she just took the offer. I know she doesn't mean to hurt me. 

I guess I am just confused on how to feel. Should I apologize for being dramatic? She definitely thinks I'm angry at her.

115,1gjq7w0,AITA for asking my friend to split the towing fee?,"I'm 30 and my friend is 35 and we became recent friends for 6 months who had a lot in common and started partying a lot. I rarely drive and only rent a car for work purposes. I happened to have a car one weekend and my friend lives 45 mins from me and she wanted me to come to her house first before we headed to a bar that was 10 minutes from her. I asked her how parking would be, and she mentioned there is a CVS she always parked and there would be no problem. She instructed me where to go and I trusted her where we should park. We were at the bar for 2 hours and came back to my car missing. I was furious because part of me knew I shouldn't have parked at a CVS but she insisted it would be fine, given that she is familiar with the area and ""parks there all the time"". After later discovering the sign and further reading it, I was able to retrieve the address to pick up my car.

Mistakes happen -- however, she did not offer to go in an Uber with me to pick up my car. She ubered home and I went to figure out my car situation myself at 1:30am. It cost me $50 to Uber to the towing company and another $500 to release it. The next morning, I explained to her the situation and she apologized and ""swore"" this has never happened before. I asked if she could contribute half, given it was her idea where we should park. She sent me $100 and said this is what she felt was fair on her part and because it was my car, I'm responsible. Although she was legally correct, morally I feel betrayed and no longer trust her. I do not drive often and the once in a blue moon I offered to drive, she provided me with incorrect information that has now put me in debt. After explaining to her my disapproval of not splitting this mess with me, she informed me to ""feel free to take legal actions if you wish"". This comment impacted my thoughts to cut ties with her, who clearly did not want to take any responsibility and would rather recommend legal action to fight her over this rather than providing that extra $150 to cover half of the bill or at least offer to buy dinner or drinks or something to make me feel like she genuinely feels bad and wants to make up for it. The fact she wanted me to consider legal action didn't see like a fair turn of events.

I understand legally, she doesn't have to pay anything, but as a friend, I would expect at least half since we are both accountable for this poor decision and I relied on her to take us somewhere safe, given she indicated that she knew the area. It would have been a different scenario, in my opinion, if I decided to park without her input and this happened. If that was the case, I wouldn't expect her to pay anything for my own decision, but she explicitly told me where to go and where to park.

116,1gjq4fb,AITA for uninviting my brother's ex-girlfriend to my wedding?,"28F, getting married in \~2 weeks.  

My brother (Kevin, 25yo) had been dating a woman (Brittany, 25yo) for a few months.  During their relationship, Brittany became increasingly controlling and manipulative; ex: she would FaceTime him and if he didn't answer she would blow up his phone trying to figure out where he is, what he is doing.  They fought constantly, big blowup arguments several times a month.   He's in recovery and doing really well, and she would often bring that up, saying he might as well have kept drinking or making sure that she told him in detail when she would go out drinking with her friends while they were fighting.  If he had a day off and didn't spend it with her, there would be a fight.

Kevin was getting to the point where he was actively unhappy in the relationship.  He said he couldn't picture himself marrying her, and he and was thinking about ending the relationship.  He is in my wedding, and I was going to let him have a +1 

Brittany broke up with him about 2 weeks ago (\~4 weeks before the wedding).  Kevin let me know the next day.  I talked with my fianc√©, and we went ahead and removed her from the guest list.  All of our RSVPs came in and we gave the final guest count to the caterer.  

Since then, Kevin and Brittany have started talking again.  This weekend I talked to Kevin and told him that we did not include Brittany in the guest list.  I wanted to make sure we were on the same page, though I assumed she was planning not to come since they hadn't gotten back together at this point.  He asked me what he should tell her, because evidently a couple of days prior she asked him if he still wanted her to come to the wedding, and he told her that it would be fine.  He also mentioned that she had already bought a dress, and said that telling her she cannot come will cause a fight.  I told him to blame it on me and tell her it was completely my and my fianc√©'s decision.  I also told him that I don't want her to cause drama or add stress for me on the day of the wedding or negatively impact him being able to enjoy the day.  He said he understood and he would tell her.

Today he messages me and asks if it would be possible to let her come anyway, because she has cleared her schedule the day of the wedding so that she can come.  I told him that I'm sorry, I think it's best that she doesn't come.  I offered to have the conversation with her myself if that would help.

117,1gjq1ps,AITA for not inviting my dad to an awards ceremony,"TL;DR I didn't invite my dad to an awards ceremony because he complained during my graduation ceremony

Last year, I graduated military college. The ceremony was held at a very prestigious hall, usually reserved for high-up officers. I was allowed 2 guests so I invited my mum and grandad (who had been in the army). I didn't invite my dad because I knew it's not his thing and that he would be bored, he's not the type of person for formal events so I thought I was doing him a favor by not inviting him.

He was very upset that I hadn't even asked him before I asked my grandad (which I now understand) and caused a huge argument, it divided my entire family. So I pleaded with the college to allow me a 3rd guest, which was a privilege to receive.

But the entire ceremony, he complained. He complained about every little detail; the line was too long, there were too many people, the ceremony was boring. He was saying these things very loudly so that all my classmates and teachers could hear. It was humiliating. This graduation had everything that I was proud of, it felt degrading.

So now I am nominated for student of the year at my new college, I do not want him at the awards ceremony, I do not want him ruining another special event.  
My parents' initial reaction to this news was annoyance because they were planning to go on vacation during that week, so they had to delay. And my dad also complained to his friend that he didn't want to go, while I was in the room.

My family are, once again, against me and now my mum is threatening not go to without my dad because of how upset he will be. I am starting to feel guilty for not inviting him, especially because I want my mum to be there. He is my dad so he should automatically be invited and I don't want him to feel like a bad father but I don't want a repeat of last time. And they did move their vacation for me, I don't want to be ungrateful for all that they've done for me.

118,1gjpijp,AITA not wanting my sister's dog near my kid? ,"My sister and her boyfriend have a Rhodesian Ridgeback, he's almost 2yo, very playful and impetuous. He's huge, but still a puppy, so he's acting like every puppy, I guess, and plays in quite a physical way (chewing your foot or elbow). 

I'm not a dog person. Since I had my son (19mo) I'm quite anxious when dogs are around, especially big dogs and especially unleashed. So my sister's dog and my son are never ever ever left together with the dog unleashed. Again, he is very impetuous. I know he wants to play, but still I'm uneased. 

This weekend my sister, her bf and their dog went to a trip in the mountains where they could leave the dog free almost all the time. She was excited and said he was a good boy, let some kids pet him (they're training him because he didn't like people touching him) and that sometimes we could make the same trip together. I said of course, as long as the dog has the leash, otherwise no problem: I'll hold my son on my shoulders or in my arms for the time the dog would run unleashed. She complained that it's unfair she couldn't do trips with both the dog and her nephew, but has to choose between the two and she can't leave the dog alone for much time because they're already work all day and he gets lonely. I didn't ask her to choose, of course, just remarked I don't want big impetuous dogs around my son: he is very gentle towards animals (we have two cats), but he still could do something to piss the dog. Or the dog could hurt him while playing. I'm not taking that risk.

I admit I don't like her dog very much. I'm a cat person, but I also love a friend's greyhound because she's quite and gentle and well behaved. I let my son play with the greyhound with my supervision but with no big worries.

I did research about last year‚Äôs event and the best way to obtain spectator passes. From what I read online, Nintendo is notorious for crowd control and passes are given out on a lottery basis. There was an interest list which opened the beginning of June so I asked my husband if he would like to go. He quickly declined because he gets anxious with big crowds. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to attend, so I‚Äôm going to put my name on the interest list; let me know if you change your mind.‚Äù I was worried about getting a 3-day pass, let alone a 1 day, but I submitted my name and hoped for the best. Around the beginning of July, I received an e-mail. I‚Äôd been selected for a Friday pass! I was super excited and immediately registered. There was an option to bring a guest, so I paid for 2 passes. 

A few weeks later, I ran into my college classmate (we‚Äôll call him Karl) and he told me he was bummed about not getting a spectator pass. He made an appointment for the pop-up Pokemon Center to buy merch for his daughter, but as someone who used to compete in TCG, he wanted to watch the local players. I didn‚Äôt immediately mention my extra spectator pass, so I went home to make one last attempt to invite my husband. Again, he said no. I said I‚Äôm going to extend my extra pass to my classmate and daughter, and he said: ‚Äúgo have fun with your friend‚Äù.

As we get closer to August, more events, merch, and activities were announced. Karl and I planned to pick up our passes on Thursday, check out the Trainer Village at Hilton Hawaiian Village, and take his daughter to the meet-and-greets. On Friday, we would check out the booths between rounds and of course, buy lots of merch. At this point, my husband is experiencing extreme FOMO. A week before the event, he approached me and asked me to take him instead. I told him no because I already registered Karl as my guest and he paid me for his admission pass. In addition, Karl added me to his Pokemon Center reservation. My husband brought up his therapist told him it was important we actively make/spend time together and I was not holding up my end of the bargain. I calmly told him after he said no, I extended another invite (which he declined) before I asked Karl. I also said it was inappropriate to use our therapy tools in this situation because I had no intention of excluding him or keeping him out of the loop; he was always my first choice. 

FYI: Sadly we didn‚Äôt get our hands on all the merch we wanted due to the scalpers, but we did walk away with lighter wallets.

So am I the AH for not taking my husband and not feeling guilty about it?

TL;DR - Won 1-day spectator passes for Pokemon World Championships, husband twice declined. Offered guest pass to classmate and daughter, and husband was upset I wouldn‚Äôt take him.

120,1gjoh2q,AITA (AWTA) for letting a friend travel to a football game on his own by a train while we travel together by car,"Hi. Me and my friends (let's call them John, Andy and Gary) are fans of a football (soccer) club that plays an away game which is an 5-6 hours drive away from our city.

We all like travelling to away games as it's really fun and somewhat of a badge of honour for a football fan.

As soon as the game was drawn, we all agreed we would definitely visit it together.

However, the number of tickets allocated for the public sale for the fans of our club were limited (around 700) and there was a very big demand for them (lower thousands of people trying to grab them).

Andy, Gary and I lucked out and managed to grab tickets in the public sale from our club, while John failed to do so because of the large demand. 

It then came out that the club allocated the rest of the tickets to ultras, fan groups, sponsors and so on. But I repeat, this only became known after we managed to secure tickets.

John then decided to travel with the ultras, who organised a train trip for the fans. The train arrives a few hours before the game and leaves straight after it. It was really his only option to be able to visit the game.

Our plan from the start was to travel by car. And that's what Andy, Gary and I are going to do. It's far more convenient and also cheaper than the train. The car journey there and back will cost around $90 between the three of us, while a ticket for the train with the ultras would be the same price for each one of us.   
All of us are university students and Gary also has a child on the way, so the money aspect does play quite a big part in this. Another, smaller, factor was that us three want to spend the night in the city our club plays in, and then travel home the next day. John needs to travel back with the ultras by the train because he needs to make it back for school the next morning.

John tried to convince us multiple times to travel with him by the train as he doesn't want to travel alone (totally understandable). But to us three there's just really no upside apart from not being bad friends.

So, are we the assholes for letting him travel on his own, while we take the cheaper, much more convenient route, just because we lucked out in the public sale?

My BF and I went to a pumpkin patch the weekend before Halloween as I love this season and wanted to do the ‚Äòcouply‚Äô thing of pumpkin picking and carving. When we completed the pumpkins I was excited to light them so we asked his siblings if they had any tealights at home -BF lives with me and they live with mum. Sister (18F) asked mum if we could come take some and she said yes so we drove over to grab a few (they live 5-10minute drive away).

When we got to Clare‚Äôs house she asked us what we did that day and why we wanted the candles. My BF replied telling her about the pumpkin patch and that we bought 3 pumpkins of varying sizes but at that point had only carved the large ones. When he went to tell her about the third one being small and possibly offer half the pumpkin for consumption, as he knows Clare loves to cook with it, she started telling him about how she‚Äôs Christian and she won‚Äôt celebrate paganism in her house (which is understandable but not in the context). She continued to talk over him while he kept trying to explain that he was trying to offer it as food, saying ‚Äúlet me finish, let me finish‚Äù over and over as Clare kept making this offer about religion, even though he is very aware of her religious beliefs and lack of holiday celebrations. My BF was blatantly annoyed at this point from body language and tone getting more abrupt with each repetition of ‚Äúlet me finish‚Äù. 

After about 2minutes of this I spoke over the pair of them saying ‚ÄúClare, we were actually offering you the pumpkin as FOOD to COOK with‚Äù and she immediately responded ‚ÄúSHUSH‚Äù with that I walked into the living room to talk to the siblings as I get along with them well and I love hanging out with them and their cats. Not long after my BF and Clare joined us in the living room, I was being quiet petting one of the cats when Clare started telling me ‚Äúhow rude I was.‚Äù 
(Context; I have depression and anxiety, I‚Äôm on medication and doing therapy currently - Clare is very aware and also aware of my childhood trauma with being yelled at and things of that nature)
Clare kept berating me about how rude I was for ‚Äútalking over her‚Äù and she started making it personal about me not the pumpkins. She‚Äôs aware of my style(I‚Äôm a bit of an e-girl/emo type, colourful hair, tattoos, piercings, wear a lot of black). I told her that I understand that Halloween is a pagan holiday originally but I‚Äôm not carving pumpkins or dressing up due to that but because I love all things spooky, but not only that, Halloween is a money grab nowadays not a ‚Äúreal holiday‚Äù. 

In the end I ended up cutting her off as she kept telling me how I can‚Äôt celebrate Halloween, baring in mind I don‚Äôt live with her, and making personal comments and so I replied ‚Äúsorry Clare but I really don‚Äôt like the way you‚Äôre speaking to me, so I am going to leave your house as I am apparently a problem‚Äù.

122,1gjnt6c,"AITA for asking my friend to respect my boundaries during my recovery, even though he‚Äôs been staying in my apartment? ","Hi, Reddit. I could really use some perspective on a recent situation with my friend Alex (name changed).

I‚Äôve been through a lot lately. I was recently (10 days ago) discharged from the psych ward after a suicide attempt and was diagnosed with a severe panic disorder, following a drug overdose a few months ago as another suicide attempt . I also have autism, ADHD, and PTSD, and the hospital environment wasn‚Äôt suitable for my sensory needs, so I left a week ago. Right now, I‚Äôm staying at a friend‚Äôs place where I feel safe and am working on adjusting my medication. Alex has visited and even stayed at this friend‚Äôs house a few times, though they hadn‚Äôt met before.

For the past six weeks, I‚Äôve actually been living out of my office so that Alex could stay in my apartment rent free, as he‚Äôs here from another country and hasn‚Äôt yet found a place to rent. I‚Äôm trying to be supportive, especially since he‚Äôs been stressed about his mother‚Äôs hospitalization in the US.

Recently, Alex wanted to talk about my future plans as I mentioned that I couldn't afford to take such a long time off work and needed to move back in with my parents in another country and have a serious long term break to avoid stress. I explained that right now, I need to prioritize my mental health and limit stressful conversations. But instead of understanding, Alex was dismissive and harsh. He told me he didn‚Äôt care about my boundaries and said he had ‚Äúworse problems.‚Äù , he demanded to have a conversation about his life struggles and said his life was in limbo, I had set a boundary that I didn't have the capacity to take on stress or drama and was sorry that his mum was unwell, but it would be better to talk to somebody else about it as I currently don't have the capacity to take on stresa. 

At one point, he said I was playing in the ‚Äúvictim Olympics‚Äù and implied that I‚Äôm somehow the ‚Äúcommon denominator‚Äù in conflicts. He even suggested I was being manipulative and that I needed do get the capacity because he needed to have the conversation.

This was really upsetting, as I felt like he was tearing me down rather than respecting my need for space. I explained that his comments were making my panic attacks worse, and that I needed to focus on staying grounded and avoiding unnecessary stress right now.

After the conversation I relapsed on drugs after 60 days clean and had a panic episode which involved me dislocating my knuckle by punching a wall in a night terror flashback. This was traumatising for my friend who's house I was starting at and he suggested that I completely cut out Alex moving forward as his behaviour is unhealthy.

I told Alex that I can‚Äôt keep having these conversations right now and that I need him to respect my boundaries. He, however, has implied that I‚Äôm overreacting and being difficult.  I need to protect my mental health, and I am letting Alex stay in my apartment rent free for the next two weeks until he can go back home - despite not wantibg to but not wanting him to be in a vulnerable situation,but I still wonder if I‚Äôm being unreasonable here, especially considering that Alex is going through a lot as well.

Later, he refuses to talk to me and won't let me watch netflix on his ipad. I asked him why and he said it wasn't fair that I got angry at him earlier like that.

126,1gjneha,AITA during friends visit,"I (29M) & my Fianc√© (29F) live close to the beach. My best friends are all male & 29. 3 of them drove down to visit at our house. In the past, there have been issues with them not helping plan at all and it is usually up to me and my other friend to make all the plans and organize everything. This leads to some issues with some of them not being happy. So a month prior I sent them a list of different activities, places to eat & drink. I asked them to review the list, do research & let me know what they want to do. I didn‚Äôt hear anything back weeks later so I reminded them again. The day before they leave, I asked them to make sure they tell me when they leave and arrival time so I can plan accordingly. Hours after they were supposed to leave I didn‚Äôt hear anything. I was then informed they left almost 3 hours ago. They were unable to rent a car because they didn‚Äôt book one until the night before they left but got here eventually.

 

Day 1 was nice, I told them we‚Äôre going to the beach. Had a great day, while we were leaving another car got stuck and blocked the exit ramp. I helping out, I asked my friend to go up there and get my strap while I drive the truck out, he got mad and said he wasn‚Äôt going to do that. I was like are you being serious? I could use some help here and we went back and forth for a minute and he reluctantly got out and did it.

 

Next day, me & fianc√© made breakfast, 2 woke up and sat on their phones, didn‚Äôt offer any help. Once everyone was awake, I asked what is the plan. Nobody said anything, my one friend was trying to get them to participate, me and him were talking about different options and things to do and no one else said anything. It is a beautiful day outside and we haven‚Äôt done anything. The only thing they came up with was to sleep until noon, go to some bars, then come back to the house and drink around a table for probably 8 hours with no thought of dinner or anything. I got fed up and said something and was probably a little harsh / yelled.  Eventually we end up going to dinner and get lucky with a table at a nice restaurant. We pull into the place; the one gets out and throws up & on the car next to us. I am done at this point. I didn‚Äôt want to go in anymore and got mad once again, but they insisted he‚Äôll be fine and we end up eating there.  I want to add I didn‚Äôt know that he got it on another until we I got home. We get home he throws up in my driveway.

 

I feel bad about getting mad. But I was getting so upset that that they put in 0 effort into this & just expected me to take them around without them helping with planning. My fianc√© picked up food for us, only 1 person paid her back, I bought breakfast one day no one even said thank you, I bought food and drinks, no one offered to help pay like all of our other house guests did.

Sooo fast forward; there were two trees in the water due heavy weather in the week before. They were ~100-200 meters apart. I moved all the way to the right in an attempt to evade the first tree. I thought i made it but there were big branches under water. My kayak capsized due the current and i was stuck with my shoe in the kayak under the water(i do not recommend, its traumatizing). The kayak was stuck against the first tree. It took some time to get my shoe unstuck, i also lost my shoe with it. I was more than a few minutes stuck and barely able to breath. So when i finally got loose and try to stand i saw my partner was putting his capsized kayak on shore and my brother was just eating chips in his kayak at the side?!?! Wtf..

Against the second tree my husband's kayak bashed and capsized. He immediately got out of his kayak(we crashed at the same time) and was already standing up and trying to get his kayak to shore.

I'm sure this is about me because 1). My brother stays with my grandma and R was at my grandma's that day, so my grandma probably told her about it, and 2).

133,1gjmfed,AITA For telling my sister off and getting her candles blow out after she left them unattended for an hour with playful young cats?,"So for a bit of context, I 21M live with my mom 56F, my brother 19M and sister 18F. My sister is the kind of person that has everyone around her walking on eggshells, and while I do my best to be a supportive older brother, I mostly just do as my younger brother does and try to avoid her best I can.

Basically, I came out of my room to go down for a smoke and spotted my sister's bedroom door wide open with multiple candles burning. I had heard her go downstairs like 45-50 minutes ago, so I was a bit worried about how long she had left them unattended especially because one of them was really close to some clothes she had hanging over her closet door. If she had jst gone downstairs to grab something I woldn't have been botthered, but she had been gone for almost an hour and we have two very playful young cats that love to chase each other throgh rooms and tend to knock things over.

So when I went down I told her to either go back to her room to keep an eye on her candles or blow them out, which did earn me a nasty look but she agreed and said once our mom answered a question for her she would. So I went out for a smoke expecting her to have gone back up once I got back in. I smoke cigarillos that usually take me like 10 mins to finish, so I though it was plenty of time. I should have known something was up when she let both the cats out as she has a habit of trying to half cover her tracks and minimize stuff to still get her way, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. But when I came back in she was still downstairs.

So I said I would just blow them out myself, which caused her to throw a whole fit about me not being allowed to go in her room let alone blow out her candles. Luckily in a rare show od a backbone my mom said she would go see if it really was a hazard, which lead to my sister trying to pull my mom off the stairs and when she failed, to pushing ahead of her. My mom did say she better not be changing anything but of course she did, the candles close the the clothes were blown out by he time my mom got there. My mom ended up blowing ot the other candles and I was going to leave it there.

But my sister decided she was going to tear into me for being so stupid and asking why I even cared. Well I have priceless antique books in the room next to hers was one reason, but also I worried for the cats. One of our previous cats who passed of old age not to long ago had in the past gotten burned by an unattended candle and she was older and less careless at that time than out current cats are now. Which of course just prompted more yelling. My brother heard the commottion and told me to just leave it because it was a loosing battle, and my mom as always came to her defense and told me off.

I don't know why this incident in particular bothers me but it does, and it geninely has me wondering if I did make a mountain ouut of a molehill. I was just worried about our cats... And a potential house fire.

So, AITA?

Edit: Based on the comments I can easily agree that yeah, I should have just put them out myself and dealt with whatever yelling may or may not have followed. It's a good learning moment that in cases of genine concern I shouldn't be more worried about how my sister will react and instead just do what should be done.

Which of course just prompted more yelling. My brother heard the commottion and told me to just leave it because it was a loosing battle, and my mom as always came to her defense and told me off.

I don't know why this incident in particular bothers me but it does, and it geninely has me wondering if I did make a mountain ouut of a molehill. I was just worried about our cats... And a potential house fire.

So, AITA?

Edit: Based on the comments I can easily agree that yeah, I should have just put them out myself and dealt with whatever yelling may or may not have followed. It's a good learning moment that in cases of genine concern I shouldn't be more worried about how my sister will react and instead just do what should be done. Thanks all for the swift replies.",2.0,0.9926257729530334,1,0
