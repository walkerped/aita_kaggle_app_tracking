0,1gjxm7m,AITA for calling security on my roommates?,"I (23 N/B) have randomly assigned roommates (Separate bed/bath, shared living). All three are 19yo students (2F, 1M).

They had a loud party that ran past 10:00PM. Our apt. quiet hours from 10PM-7AM. The next morning I found my dishes moved, my food squashed in the fridge, and my washcloth missing.

They share groceries and dishes with each other, but I have a firm ""don't touch my stuff"" line that they all agreed to. I moved all my stuff to my bedroom.

That morning, I explained when quiet-hours are and shared the number for security. My roommates said it was dramatic moving my stuff, that I should've expected the party to be loud, and that we need to accommodate each other's lifestyles.

A week later, someone stumbles in at 2:00AM, carried by their friends. It woke me up. I asked Beth about it later (fake names), but didn't feel like playing detective.

Another night they were on the patio laughing and talking, the TV blasting, and guests were over, so I called security on them. I was not going to be ignored. My roommates hid in their rooms. After ringing awhile, I answered the door, told him I had called. We got a warning email.

My roommates heard me admit to calling security on the doorbell camera. Five paragraphs were sent between them calling me dramatic, saying they had had to accommodate me and I should do the same. I told them that the rules were in the lease they signed. If thereâ€™s a problem with the rules, talk to the manager. Eight paragraphs after that. They ask if Iâ€™m planning to renew my lease next year, and offer to pay the fee if I want to move out early.

What we landed on later was Iâ€™d text the group first when they were loud.

So it happened again and I texted them. Conner responds that I ""could have gotten up and said something"". Anna said she knew Iâ€™d been up cause my light was on.

Yet another quiet-hours violation, and I texted the group that I would be going straight to security next time. As it was, I was still getting woken up at 2AM with no consequences. In my book, you only get to plead incompetence so many times.

Last week the apt. manager asked to schedule a meeting to ""go over updates"" and ""see how things are going"". Translation: ""they want to kick me out, letâ€™s do an intervention then assess"" I had asked about it years ago, but never went forward.

Ann pushed us to schedule the meeting. I said it sounded like a waste of time so I'd skip it.Â 

Ann called me crazy for threatening to call security, that they weren't being that loud and they werenâ€™t gonna tiptoe around their own apt.

Ann now claims the meeting is mandatory. Iâ€™ve scoured the lease and think she might be lying. I told her that if sheâ€™s not loud I won't call security, and they won't get fined regardless. She wants to talk about it more, but Iâ€™m not interested in sitting and being called crazy. Iâ€™m non-binary, I get plenty of that as is.

I can see that I'm being a bit of a stickler, and I hate doing that. I just can't stand working on four hours of sleep.
