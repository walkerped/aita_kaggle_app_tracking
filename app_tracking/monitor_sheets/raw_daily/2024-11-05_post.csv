0,1gkkz05,WIBTA if i asked my roommate to not have her mom over past a certain time at night?,"For Context, I (18F), live with my roommate (18F) who I'll call Suzie, and we live in a shared dorm room (standard dorm: small open room, no privacy) at college. Suzie lives very close to the college, and goes home for the weekend every Friday, and comes back to the dorm on Sunday nights anywhere from 10-10:45pm, (somtimes but not always, later). On the other hand I do not live close to college, so I don't go away on the weekends. 

Every Sunday that Suzie comes back to the dorm, her mom also comes with her in our room to put her stuff away, clean, etc. Her mom doesn't stay a super long time (I would say 15-20min., on occasion longer), but mainly my issue is the time that she has her mom over. Honestly it's just in general frustrating that it's every single Sunday that her mom is in our room at that time, but I'm not really sure how much I have the right to tell her how much she can have her mom over? Probably not much I can do there, but I digress. Also sometimes her mom tries to make small talk with me, when, in the nicest way of saying this as possible, I don't want to feel like I have to talk to her every time, yet I don't want to come off as rude; I just don't want to feel pressured to talk/be ""on"" when her mom is here, on top of the time that her mom is here. Suzie is just extremely dependant on her family, and I don't know her very well and respect her in that way for the most part, it's just that habit has made living with her kind of frustrating in the sense that I feel like I'm living with a little sister. I just don't know what to do because I don't know how to go to her now after it's been going on since school started and set a boundary with her.

So, WIBTA for going to her and asking that she comes earlier with her mom if she really wants her mom to come in with her?

1,1gkklbv,AITA for a different living (potentially noisy) schedule? ,"Ok so in my flatshare/apartment there are a few of us living together with one person right next door to me, we get along well but had some issues recently with my very creaky door that also doesn't shut softly. Add to that coming in home drunk one night and it caused a fight. I fixed the door so it no longer creaks and shut it so slowly it barely makes a noise, bought them a bottle of wine and did the cleaning for two weeks. They were happy i took things seriously and we made amends.

Now the current issue is i have a flexible schedule with my job (no fixed hours or in the morning) as well as insomnia which keeps me up about 2-3 hours after they've gone to bed. This wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the damn creaky floorboards. I'm literally walking around the apartment to go to the toilet once before bed like a old timey cartoon character and they still make so much noise. Nothing has been said and things seem to mostly be ok so far but i'm worried things will explode again if i end up waking them up again. So AITA for having this different schedule, i really feel i can't help things more-so currently and i'm just a late riser and i definitely can't do anything (to my knowledge) about the floor boards.

2,1gkkfvc,AITA for my girlfriend not getting into the school she wanted?,"My girlfriend is a non-traditional college student. She completed her associate's last spring with a very high GPA and meant to apply to some prestigious schools. Whenever she started working on her applications, though, she would panic and shut down. She ended up missing all of her deadlines; she did complete her application for one Ivy League school, but didn't submit it at the last moment, saying it was embarrassing and that she had no place there.

I didn't know what to do in these moments, to be honest, but I am sure what I did wasn't right. She would really shut down and pull into herself, going into a thousand yard stare or breaking down in tears. I tried consoling her, but I can't remember a time it worked. I read over her application essays and made suggestions, but she would get defensive and reject them. I'm a pretty bad writer and she's a very good one, so that was likely the right call.

Now she's at a local public university and in tears every day because she finds it isn't the right fit. She blames me and tells me I didn't help enough, that she never felt supported through the process. I asked how I could have helped, and she called me an asshole, saying she didn't know ""how to explain how to help people."" She says she doesn't know if she can forgive me for this.

I am willing to accept I'm the asshole and I'm what's holding her back, but I legitimately don't know what I should have done. How does one help an adult shutting down? What was I supposed to do in this situation?

3,1gkkdod,AITA for asking my roommate to move out? ,"My (28F) roommate (43F) has been living with me since June. I own my house but wanted a roommate to help with bills and mortgage. We had known each other a year before hand as we were both members of a voluntary veterans group. 

When I first made the agreement I was under the impression they worked full time and also drew disability from Veteran Affairs, this means she gets 2400 a month plus what ever she makes. The rent was split 60/40 with the 60 being my part as it's three bedrooms and I kept two. I'll refer to my roommate as RA for the remainder of the post. RA's portion of rent was 1000 plus utilities. 

we met a few weeks in advance, RA has a daughter every other weekend which and I enjoyed showing her how to bake and was a great kid.  About a month ago RA approached me in tears stating they were unsure of the outcome of a case between RA and the daughters other parent. We talked it through and everything seemed fine. 

Fast forward to this last Saturday when rent was due. RA sent the amount like normal and I routed it to my bank which takes about 2 days. Later that night I received a text message that RAs bank had denied the transfer. RA informed me they over drew their bank account but now had the funds (1200$). 

 I texted RA asking if I could help in any way. I work with homeless and indigent individuals and assist with budgeting and utlizing resources. They said it was fine and they could send me 1000$ and then get the rest to me. So last night I was at a concert and got another message saying the transfer had again been denied. 

So today I sent a message stating I felt used as they could have told me they didn't have the money and I had already placed all my available funds into other debts and had to pull funds to make up for not paying bills. I also stated I needed to know a long term plan so that this doesnt happen again. I feel like a asshole. But I've been used before when I was younger and needed to lay the cards out. 

RA informed me that they had applied to normal SSDI so that they could pull VA disability and SSDI. I informed them you can't work while applying for SSDI or it will significantly lower your chances. RA stated they did not plan on working and to live off of disability. RA doesn't leave the house except to work and otherwise plays video games. 

RA is currently selling most of her possessions to make up the amount. I told them not to and we could work something out but they just left with most of their valuables. I never asked them to leave and repeatedly stated I struggled with housing when I was younger and they could stay until they found something. 

At this point I can't tell if I'm being used to try and feel bad or if I'm the asshole in the situation. ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-05,"AITA for asking my roommate to move out?

5,1gkjl8j,AITA for not inviting my boyfriend for dinner?,"I really think this isn’t a big deal but I also felt a bit terrible so I need some perspective. Basically I was hosting a movie day with my friends at our place. My boyfriend is a pretty big introvert and most of my friends are quite loud, ADHD and just very extroverted, so he doesn't like to hang out with them all that much which is fine because they're my friends and not his. Because of this, we've discussed this beforehand about when people would be arriving/leaving and if someone could sleep over and whatnot. My boyfriend knew we were going to watch some movies but besides that I didn’t really discuss the agenda of the get together because I like it to be quite chill. In the end, we ended up ordering a couple pizza's and sharing it as we continued watching movies and I kind of forgot to include him in our dinner plans because all day he was either outside doing his own thing or in our reading room hanging out by himself. Now he’s saying it’s very inconsiderate of me that I didn’t include him in our dinner plans and that I should next time. I feel really bad but I also feel like he's a grown adult and could've spoken up or even ordered his own dinner if he wanted. AITA?

TLDR: my boyfriend excluded himself from my friends and I, and now feels upset that we didn’t include him with our dinner plans.

edit: thanks for your replies guys. I usually think of if I would mind if the roles were reversed and my thought process went ""well I was basically alone all day, so I’ll do dinner alone"" that’s why i couldn’t really figure it out. I wanted to know if it was a him-thing or a people-in-general-thing. Now I know, so thanks!
Couple clarifications; he’s not angry or anything. The convo went -""can you include me with dinner next time"" -""oh right I’m sorry"" -""thanks, it's okay we didn’t discuss it but now we know for next time"" -""yes next time I’ll think of it, sorry""
I like my boyfriend plenty, we are just very independent people so sometimes we forget to consider each other with making plans for things.

6,1gkjkdg,"AITA for planning the euthanisia of the family dog, despite my step-daughter's protests?","My husband and I live together and my stepdaughter (22) lives between our house and her mum's. She probably spends 65% of her time here. I also have a stepson but he's at university.

We have a 12 year old Labrador, Lola. Lola was dumped on my husband at the age of 1 by his ex (stepchildren's mum) because she couldn't be bothered with her and has a history of selling on family pets when she gets bored/overwhelmed with caring for them.

My husband took Lola in (and a cat, but that's another story) and has provided all of her care for 11 years. His kids would go out for walks with Lola as a family from time to time, but aside from that he does everything. I met Lola when she was 9 and her decline since then is very evident.

The problem is Lola has became senile and regardless of how many times we let her out before bed, we will wake up to urine/poo on the carpet. We rent so putting down better flooring isn't really an option. My husband has vaxxed the carpet every morning since I can remember due to this. It's unsanitary and we're embarrassed to have people over because of the stains and the smell, we literally can't keep on top of it. When Lola does pass on we will get the carpet a deep professional clean as many times as it's needed, but at the moment it would be a futile effort.

My husband works from home so Lola can use the garden whenever she needs. She can't really go on walks longer than 10 minutes anymore.

My husband and I are at the end of our tether and Lola's quality of life, if I'm honest, is shit. She sleeps, eats and then pisses/shits on the carpet at night. She's started barking through the night for no reason and we've had to put a stair gate up as she attempts to climb the stairs which her joints can't manage anymore.

Stepdaughter however, when we talk about euthanasia due to all of the above, tells us we want to euthanise Lola simply because we can't be bothered with her anymore. She feels that the situation with Lola's incontinence isn't enough to warrant euthanasia and that we are being heartless and overzealous. We advised today that this will probably be Lola's last Christmas and we'll make the most of it. Stepdaughter left the room crying.

I for the most part have tried to keep out of it despite the situation getting me down because this isn't my childhood dog, so I feel that I don't really get a say in it, despite living here. My husband has no attachment to Lola anymore because of the situation, and is still caring for her but resents her if I'm honest. Every time we try to bring up the subject, stepdaughter cries and leaves the room and it's causing a lot of tension in the house. We feel like she isn't appreciating how hard the incontinence is to manage/how unclean it is, she thinks we're heartless.

7,1gkiys9,AITA for wanting my parents to send me to a high tuition cost uni that they can very clearly afford. ,"Am I the asshole for wanting my parents to pay for a good university? 

Here’s the gist of it 

I want to transfer to a university in my city, Madrid, but it’s expensive, tuition is about 25k a year for 3 years, but I find it to be worth it. 

I’m currently attending a university I don’t like at all, and my parents clearly only chose it because the fees are cheaper.

I could go on and on about how I hate the conservative religious bullshit the university is known for, or the poor level of education, the shitty campus that is quite literally just an old reformed school building.. it’s genuinely made me miserable. 

I already have friends who attend the other uni and from a reputation and networking standpoint it is the best in my country. And it’s closer to my house, and lessons are taught in English which is my first language. The one I currently attend can’t even give me a proper worksheet without evident syntax errors and broken English. 

Here’s the issue. My father alone makes 20k a month pre tax, but still refuses to pay for my tuition as he wants to retire before 60.. I have friends who’s parents are working hard and paying everything they can to afford them their dream unis… why can’t I get the same? 

Every time I bring up the uni my parents fixate and obsess over “cost efficient” alternatives. Like.. what?? You make 250 thousand a year and you can’t spend a few extra thousands to send me to a uni that is miles better than the one I’m in?  I can’t even push my parents on it because my mother starts yelling at me saying I’m manipulating them to pay for a posh uni tuition so I can slack off with rich kids all day. She won’t even hear me out or check reviews on the university. All she cares is that it’s known for being more “high end” when it comes to costs. 

What really drives me crazy is that my parents have genuinely said things like “but son.. if we pay for your tuition, when will I be able to buy myself a boat so I can go out on beach expeditions at our summer home?”

AITA? ",Asshole,2024-11-05,"AITA for wanting my parents to send me to a high tuition cost uni that they can very clearly afford.  Am I the asshole for wanting my parents to pay for a good university? 

Here’s the gist of it 

I want to transfer to a university in my city, Madrid, but it’s expensive, tuition is about 25k a year for 3 years, but I find it to be worth it. 

I’m currently attending a university I don’t like at all, and my parents clearly only chose it because the fees are cheaper.

Also, I was talking to AD once about MBTI (if you don’t know what an MBTI is it’s about personalities), and i told her to take the test. And, as she was doing it, she was PROUDLY declaring herself a ‘narcissist’ and ‘selfish’. That’s not something you should be proud of.

I talked to the other people in the group about it, and they agreed that it was a need for concern.

9,1gkidf6,AITA for telling my friend to stop bothering me in class?,"Me (m15) and friend (m15) are in grade ten, and we’ve been best friends since grade eight. For some context, he’s an amazing friend, we just went trick or treating with each other and we’re like two peas and a pod. He’s a genuinely kind person and we both have so much in common. However, my friend has ADHD, and so do I, but I guess it’s different severities in this scenario. Since he constantly needs something in his hands, he’ll usually have a stress ball or some sort of thing to fidget with. Like an eraser, pencil, etc.

Ever since the beginning of grade ten, he’s been constantly poking me with sharp ass pencils, whipping me with some elastic or something, taking my things without me consenting or knowing. Or sometimes outright destroying stuff like karate chopping my pencil or twisting the long end on a pen cap off, etc. (We started school in August, and it’s been happening since.) even breaking a part of my binder once when he was really energetic. But it was still in tact.

I never minded too much at first, since I understood him. But he’s usually hyper and I’m the more tired one, so sometimes I just wanted to tell him to stop. But I struggle talking up, since I’m not very social and refrain from saying “no” a lot. But for the last couple weeks, it’s been getting more annoying and I’m really struggling to pay attention sometimes when he’s bugging me. Especially considering I’m kind of a perfectionist and I don’t like things that are even slightly damaged.

So yesterday, when he was poking me with a pencil and it was stinging. I told him that I would like him to stop, but not just a usual “stop”. I told him that since I respect his personal space all the time when he’s tired and when I’m rather energetic. And I don’t do that stuff when he’s literally sleeping in class, I never raised my voice when I said any of this, I kinda just told him in the tone as if we were having a normal conversation. But he would constantly do it when I’m trying to focus. Because this is annoying when I’m trying to take notes on the board and he’s whipping me with an elastic.

But today, he didn’t really talk to me as much. Hanging out more with some friends that I never really talked to, basically making me think, “is he distancing himself from me?” But I think he just maybe needed a break since he said he was tired, but he’d still sit with me in class if he was tired.

10,1gki5pt,WIBTA If I Took My Cat When Moving?,"Throwaway because I don’t know if my father has a Reddit account.

I(19f) am soon moving in with my mother(60f) 2 and a half hours upstate for better opportunities. Currently, I am living with my father(60m) and my cat, who I will call Socks for the sake of anonymity.

I got Socks when I was maybe 16 with my father from the animal shelter and absolutely fell in love with him. He’s a sweet American Shorthair who looked very similar to a girl cat I used to have that had passed sometime in 2019. I had this girl cat for 9 years until she passed and was debilitating when I lost her.

Socks had unintentionally been an emotional support animal with me. If I don’t eat for a day, then he won’t eat. If I don’t come out of my room, he’ll meow and scratch at my door until I come out. To say he’s my best friend is an understatement.

My father on the other hand causes me more stress than anything. When I was 17, I was forced to live with him after getting out of a mental hospital, which he expected me to simple be adjusted from the day I moved in. The fact that he put so much pressure on me and the fact that I was still getting used to a new school and not living with my mother for the first time in my life, caused me to unfortunately drop out of high school. 

I plan to go back and get my GED, but since then, he has made no attempt to help me study, or encourage me. I wanted to get a job, but he wouldn’t allow me to for various excuses like “he can’t drive me because he works 8 hours a day”(i tried to compromise and told him i could probably work around his schedule), “Nobody is hiring”, or the worst “You have everything you need here”. 

He whines every time I want to go out and since I don’t have a license yet, he is my only form of transportation, essentially isolating me. He constantly plays Call of Duty and just before making this post, threw a fit because I wanted to finish a game I wanted and he wanted to play. I told him he could play tomorrow because I really wanted to finished this.

This is why I’m moving in with my mom. She is going to help me get my GED, a job, and a Drivers license while actively supporting me through it. Now here comes the issue, Socks. 

If I leave Socks, he definitely won’t eat, nobody will be reminded to give him his medicine(he’s asthmatic), and his overall mental health will deteriorate significantly. But my dad has also grown attached to him and would be really lonely without him. So..

11,1gkhp7b,AITA for telling my friends I don't want to rent with them the night they're trying to sign a lease?,"Hello. I am a 19 year old first-year college student, who about a week ago, agreed with a group of 5 friends that I'd be interested in living with them next school year. 

Yesterday, we found a place we really liked and talked about how we'd figure out the lease by the end of the week. Today they've decided they want to sign the lease ASAP/by tonight because the landlord explained that the market is competitive and they don't want to lose this nice house... But, reading through the lease has made me realize I don't want to do this financially. 

Even with the 5 of us, this would cost me $750/month or $9k to live there for august 2025-july 2026, not counting utilities... and that is money that could go towards classes (I am paying for school by myself and just came back from a gap year of working. I do not want to take any loans and have a lot of anxieties about going into debt after college because it happened to mom and it still effects her). My family also lives close enough to campus that I can just stay with them without having to pay anything.  

These friends are all from out of town so they need to find a place to stay. I feel like a dick now for saying I don't think I can as soon as they are trying to sign the place, because I definitely could with the money I have saved, but I know I'll regret it in the future. I know I really don't want to, but feel like I have to because they don't have anyone else and they need 5 people.

Right now I am banking on the fact that my parents refuse to co-sign, but I technically wouldn't need them because my credit score is better than the both of them. Do I continue to lie and say that my parents are the reason I can't sign? Most if not all of these places require us to have co-signers because we're so young, but my parents' financial history are so poor they don't think they'd be approved as co-signers

I feel like an asshole because this is causing them a lot of anxiety, but it would be better for my own anxiety in the long run if I stayed at home and saved the money... I don't know how any of them are paying for school, so I feel awkward and kind of like an asshole for suddenly saying I couldn't afford it.

I don't want to screw them over but know I will if I pull out, which is what I want to do...)",Asshole,2024-11-05,"AITA for telling my friends I don't want to rent with them the night they're trying to sign a lease?

The other friends didn’t make much and so she covered it. She also paid for a portion of my wife’s rent twice and she normally pays the bills if she and my wife go out for food. 

This friend is now marrying a doctor and I don’t think they have any trouble with paying for anything they want. My wife is a SAHM and I’m a mechanic.

She began yelling and stuff. Now she keeps telling me about how her other friends have told her to leave me and stuff which I get why they might think that. But this is related to what I'm saying because I think she tells me this wayy too often. From her perspective she thinks I practically cheated her with this.  So AITA for doing what I did?

15,1gkh9z2,AITA For Ditching My Bf When He Comes To Visit?,"My bf (m31) and I (f27) have been dating for a year and a half. I’m originally from one coast and he is from the other and we met in college near his hometown. Now that we are both out of school we live together in his hometown, but I make frequent trips across the country to visit my friends and family. This year he is accompanying me home for Christmas and it will be our first holiday season together. We will be staying with my family in my childhood home. 

Every year I host a Ladies Holiday party in December for my high school friend group. We were all close growing up and remain friends into adulthood. We all have busy lives and some have moved away so this is really the only time of year we can get together. The rule of the holiday party is that it is just the high school friend group. No partners, spouses, or kids. I host at my parent’s house and they enjoy getting to say hi to all my friends that they have known 15+ years. 

My boyfriend likes football so I planned to host the party on a Sunday when he could watch football in a back room while I throw my party for about 2 hours. I’d love for him to have a chance to meet those he hasn’t yet when they arrive without encroaching on our space. 

He is upset and feels that I am kicking him out. This previous winter I had some friends from high school come out to visit for my birthday. Bf and I were not living together at the time and my friends crashed at my place for 4 days. I was also in school at the time but ended up cutting my unnecessary classes that week to spend time with them but I was still gone 2-4 hours every day they were in town. At the time bf wanted some me time to himself to celebrate my birthday. He kept asking me to spend the night at his place. I said that wouldn’t be fair to my friends who had flown across the country to visit me. I did sneak away from them for an hour to spend time with him but that was all I could manage. I already felt bad that I was leaving them on their own while I was in class. 

Now my bf is saying that he feels I don’t value him as much as my friends cuz I will make time for them without him when he travels but not the other way around. I said it’s not a fair comparison because bf is here for 2.5 weeks and my friends were only in town for 4 days. Also this party will be the only time while he is in town that we will be apart and when my friends visited I still had to make time for school.

16,1gkgwuf,WIBTAH if I reported my (31F) Fiance's (32M) parents neighbor's dog?,"The neighbor in question is elderly and disabled with little to no support elsewhere. She trained (not a certified dog in any sense of the word) a German Shepherd to help her with a few things around the house. The things the dog cannot help with, my fiance's parents help her with. This being the case, our family is very close with her. She dotes on our daughter getting her gifts very often and states she feels like a 3rd grandmother.

My daughter (3) was at her grandparent's place after school and went down to this neighbor's house, as they often do to play with the dog and visit with the neighbor. Daughter's grandmother had gotten up to get something for the neighbor and turned her back for a second. In that second, the dog bit my daughter in the face. She has a gash wound ONE INCH from her right eye, a split lip, and raised scratches all over her face, trailing to her arm a little. They are obvious bite mark wounds and have been confirmed by the doctor when we took her to the ED shortly after.

Admittedly, in the beginning, we, her parents, decided not to report the dog and just not allow our daughter to go over there anymore. We encouraged Fiance's parents to also distance themselves for their safety. That is until Fiance received a call from the neighbor's husband.

The husband is claiming my daughter was near the dog, tripped, and hurt herself. He did not ask if she was okay, or how she was holding up. When it was expressed that we were disappointed he did not ask about how our daughter was doing and did not plan on reporting anything at this time (in the calmest tone he could muster) the husband doubled down and insisted Daughter had fallen. What would be on the floor of your house to cause a split lip and a gash an inch long on her face?!

The blatant disregard for my daughter's well-being really has me rethinking things, and I wasn't really all that far on the ""don't report it"" side to begin with. So, WIBTAH for reporting this dog that helps this woman, but is obviously dangerous?

TL;DR: Daughter was bit in the face by the dog of a lonely, disabled elderly woman. WIBTAH for reporting the dog?

**UPDATE:** Just going to update and address a few things I've seen mentioned a few times.

In my state, it is required by law for the hospital to report the incident to animal control. However, I've been informed that if they don't call me for further details the next day, there probably won't be any follow-up for the dog/owner.

My daughter is up to date on all her vaccines, including the DTaP for Tetanus, so an additional shot was not needed. She did get 3 facial images done to ensure there were no hairline fractures, and there are none thankfully. 

What I originally described as a gash is actually a deep puncture with a 1"" scratch coming from said wound about 1"" away from her eye. Upon further inspection, there are also deep scratches on her arms and a puncture on her jawline that was noticed at the ED, in addition to the split lip and other scratches on her face. Since it's been 24 hours since the incident, she now has a black eye, purple bottom lip, and several bruises on her face, neck, shoulders, and arms.

My daughter was not unattended with a large dog. The dog's owner was in the same room as my daughter and her dog. However, being unable to walk she could not get her dog off my daughter, so my MIL had to, who was in the kitchen a few feet away. The neighbor is refusing to tell me or my fiance what she saw happened. idk if this is because everything happened so fast she didn't really see it, or can't remember it from the shock and stress of it all, or if she saw exactly what happened and is worried for the future of her dog.

We have decided to call Animal Control, and expressed that we don't want the dog to get hurt, but feel it needs to be put on record in case this happens with someone else.

18,1gkgkbc,AITA for playing Fortnite with other guys when I have a bf? ,"My (31 f) bf (29 m) has issues with me playing Fortnite with other guys. 
Some context. My best friend got me into Fortnite a few months ago. I never was that interested in it, having played other BR games like pubG, but I got into it pretty quickly. I finally saw what all the appeal of Fortnite was with the skins, emotes, BR and the varieties of creative modes. 
Before FN, when I came home from work I would just doomscroll on my FB, IG or watch YT/Netflix. After doing that for a while I felt myself feeling slightly depressed. But finding this game made me happy to have something to look forward to when I got home from work, and it is a great way to decompress. I’m not really a social person, definitely more introverted so going out after work never really appealed to me. 
My boyfriend did play FN BR with me sometimes but he preferred to play other games like magic (mostly magic actually). And TBH he wasn’t the best teammate to play BR with as he tends to wander off and pick fights with players when I/ squads were not around. Not very good comms, even tho we are in the same room of the house. I would also play with my friend who got me into FN, but not often as we both are busy during different times of the day. I did play some random BR games but never really found any teammates that wanted to play again or add as a friend. 
I started going into creative lobbies where I mostly enjoyed emoting with other players. Running around, gaining XP in a low pressure situation was very fun to me, unlike the BR version which can stress me out when I’m taking shots from who knows where. 
Eventually I got comfortable a few times talking on the mic in the creative lobbies. Of course, I’m a girl so I got some attention from guys, but from what I can tell that’s normal and it “shocks” guys when they hear an actual girl playing the game. 
I did end up finding some people (guys and a couple girls) that I could chill and vibe with, and some of them were willing to help me level up and complete the battle pass. I accepted since I’ve only started playing a few months ago and will take the help. 
Now my bf has issues that I play with the same guys when I play FN. I have asked him to play with me when I’m playing with them but he just says no. He thinks these “relationships” I’m having are an issue but I don’t see what the fkn problem is. They don’t live in the same state as me, and the only thing we share is that we play the same game and want to level up. 
I will admit, one time I did share my insta with a dude who we played games together, my bf found out and I apologized and realize that yes that was fkd up, but I haven’t done it again since. Now I’m just keeping these people as friends only in the game. So I’m not sure what to do.

23,1gkf8iu,AITA for picking up my neighbour’s lingerie?,"So there’s this couple who lives across from me (as in our balconies face each other) on the floor above mine. Now ever since they moved in, I’ve noticed the wife tends to do her laundry typically on the same day, and she has her husband hang it out on their balcony to dry once it’s finished.

Now I don’t know if he’s just ignorant or just doesn’t care, but he sorta just drapes the clothes over the railing rather than hanging them up properly. What ends up happening is that smaller and thinner pieces of clothing like lingerie (bras and underwear and whatnot) end up falling off the railing where the wind then carries them to MY balcony.

Even so, mistakes happen so I take any that fell inside, make sure they get properly dried, and hold onto them until I can awkwardly return them the next morning. The wife is obviously embarrassed but thankful towards me for not letting her lingerie get lost.

Fast forward many months and this is still happening like clockwork on a weekly basis. Me and the wife are now pretty much on an unofficial schedule that she comes by my apartment to pick up her lingerie the morning after laundry day. It doesn’t matter how many times she tells her husband to fix the problem it never changes (she works during the time they need to be hanged so she can’t do it herself.

Now after all of this, I run into her husband one afternoon and he’s ANNOYED at me. He didn’t shout, more sharply worded, but he made his point clear. He doesn’t like what I’ve been doing, I shouldn’t be touching his wife’s lingerie let alone keeping it overnight in my apartment. According to him, me taking a married woman’s intimate clotting is creepy and violating. And if I was really just returning it I wouldn’t keep it overnight and instead come to their apartment late at night to return it immediately. He also spent a while completing that his wife was giving him a hard time for how he was hanging the clothes thanks to me. Calling it an “asshole move” on my part.

I don’t believe I’m the asshole in this situation. I’m the one making up for HIS mistake’s and returning the lingerie to its owner at my earliest convenience. Like a good neighbour SHOULD do. I get that it’s a very intimate item but I feel like I’m innocent here. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-05,"AITA for picking up my neighbour’s lingerie?

However, now that his daughter has not been allowed to stay overnights or come over in 3 months,, I told him I think it's only fair we make that room our son's room.

All right, so this is my first post. I just wanna know if I’m the ahole for not wanting to go to a restaurant with my whole family. For context, I was told two months ago, that myself, my mother, my stepfather, my stepsister and her two children seven and two and possibly my cousin will be going to a restaurant for Thanksgiving. So today I was just told by my mother that my stepsister‘s mother who is raising my stepsister’s seven-year-old will be joining. Now there’s long history in short she’s a narcissist and had caused my stepsister to develop Borderline Personality disorder. The issue I have is since I turned 18 one year after the seven-year-old was born. I had made a clear boundary that I do not want to go to social settings that include my step sister‘s mother which my mother agreed is perfectly fine now for Thanksgiving She is telling me that I need to be an adult and put aside my boundaries of not wanting to be involved with my stepsister‘s mother because it is also the seven-year-old‘s birthday now I had explained to her that I will make it still a happy day and a happy occasion And we’ll celebrate before the dinner and they can go to dinner and when they come back, everyone can tell me how it was, and I will still be happy and polite.

He and my mom divorced when I was 1 but he bailed days after I was born, came back when I was 8 months old and my mom let him stay a month before realizing he wasn't serious about being a family with us and just used her for a place to stay. Once he realized she wasn't going to give in he bailed again. He was in my life for a year when I was 3-4 years old. Then he was gone again. The next time I was 8. He was in my life for a few months under supervision but he left again and he made 2 appearances when I was 10. He didn't really pay child support either, which I learned this summer. Some money was given for me but probably less than $400 in the last 16 years if what he said is right.

When I was 13 he moved here for good, or so he says. He was married again and he had some kids with his wife. He went back to restart visitation with me, got some supervised visits again that became one overnight a month. Until finally I have to spend every other weekend at his house even though I don't want to. And I did speak to a judge about my wishes but he told me it was in my best interest to have a relationship with ""my family"" 

I really don't like being there and I try to only sleep in the bed I have at his house. I never take anything I care about and I don't have the room personalized or anything.

The thing about all this is my dad and his wife encourage their kids to spend time with me and engage with me. They like having me there and they told me before they wish I'd spend more time there and with them. The kids did nothing wrong but I don't want to focus on a relationship with them.

Which I find crazy since I don't know any of these people all that much and I don't want to. If it's not my dad's weekends, I do miss the big stuff and I don't try to be there for them.

I got invited to go trick or treating with them on Halloween. I said no. I got a reply back that they really wanted me to come.

29,1gkco7b,WIBTA if I take my boyfriend's money?,"I (f18) am a first year college student. I'm a commuter and I love about 30 minutes away from my college. I make basically first for money and can barely afford to get to my college each week and feed myself, actually I basically can't afford and it if it weren't for my boyfriend (m18) I would not be able to eat every week. Right now I don't have time for another job and I can't get more hours at my current workplace due to my busy schedule.

On the other hand my boyfriend isn't going to college and doesn't have a car, instead he has a full time job, no bills, and plays video games when hes not at work or with me. His mom and neighbor drive him to and from work every day and he makes more than 4 times what I make weekly. He works hard and is very good at his job so obviously he deserves what he makes.

Before I started college the rolls were reversed, I had job that I worked 20-30 hrs a week at and made about half of what he's making now but he had no job at all. I was mainly stuck to paying for all of our activities and still could barely afford it but we made it work.

Now that I'm in college and our dynamic has swapped he pays for relatively all of our activity expenses, and even sometimes covers my gas for the trips we make. I am beyond grateful at how much he pays for and I have no idea how to make it up to him but I'm often left feeling like I'm just a money pit for him. 

On top of all of that he insists almost daily on giving me money for the week, though I have never accepted it. He claims that the only reason he got a job in the first place was to save up for a car and spend his money on me since he couldn't when we first started dating but I feel like I cannot in good conscience take his money for my own benefit. Its not that I have an ego issue with taking other people's help but I understand the value of money in today's economy and I genuinely feel wrong for accepting his handouts. I know in reality that if he did give me money it likely wouldn't harm him financially but it still just feels wrong.

Sometimes when I think about how financially screwed I am at the moment I consider accepting his offer but there's a small part of me that just feels wrong about the whole ordeal. 

I guess I just need a fresh perspective from people on the outside of my current predicament. Would I be the asshole if I ended up accepting his offers? Is it greedy? I feel like he's already paying for enough things

His fiancé pretty much does not share anything about the details of the wedding to the family. She canceled the ceremony without talking to us and just decided to have an intimate ceremony at their church with just an immediate family and will just have a reception in December with the extended family. When the family keeps asking what the plan was and if there is anything we could do to help, she would just respond, we got it, just attend.

My inlaws are known for indirect insults and backhanded comments. But, what transpired over the weekend (me) is an eye opening for him. He made it very clear to us that he was the one who suggested to not have us at the ceremony because it is also his fiancé’s wedding, and he wants his fiancé to be surrounded by people that love and support her at her wedding day. He also made it clear to us to not even dare to ask him to choose between his fiancé or family because we will not like the answer. If we have issues about it, then that’s our problem and that he will never talk about this anymore unless we apologize to his fiancé. But the entire family do not even know what we did, and the entire family thinks that her reaction on what happened over the weekend is a bit much.

31,1gkckxf,AITA for planning a Disney trip without my stepdaughter and leaving her with her father,"I (41F) and my husband (41M) have four children. I have one child from a previous relationship, he has two, and we have one together. 

We have always treated the children as equally as possible, though with extended family, they don't always go on the same trips if we don't go. Ex: his parents take his children on vacations and my child doesn't want to go without me. This has never been an issue. But when we plan trips, we always take everyone. 

The problem is that my SD (16 f) doesn't really like anything that anyone else does. Or she will like it until someone else does. Ex: she really wanted to go on a winter trip to Colorado for skiing. None of the other children were that excited, but seeing as it's hard to find things she likes, we went. She was excited until the other kids started enjoying it too, then she wanted to leave. This is pretty much what happens when we went on trips to the zoo, museums, anything. And if other people are already happy about it, she immediately hates the idea.

We thought maybe she just wanted time with each parent alone. So we did that with both her mom and dad. She still complained the whole time. Her counselor said maybe she wants activities with both parents to show they get along. They did that but if they show any enjoyment at all, she hates whatever they are doing. We've done girl days with her mom and I and she hates it. We have found the less enthusiastic we are, the more she wants to do it. 

This applies to meals too. If someone else likes something, she finds ways to criticize it. It's like she can't let anyone else enjoy anything. She also likes things more if no one else wants to do them. This also happens when she goes with her aunt and cousins. Her sister is not like this at all. We've asked her if she has any insight (their mother has too) and she comes up with nothing other than, ""She's just a b***h"" and shrugs. 

We let her choose other day trips, told her she can bring her friend, but it's the same. If she sees someone like something she chose, she complains and says it was her idea like no one else can enjoy it.

So this year, we had been talking about Disney for a while. My nephew has cancer and has always wanted to go with us because he has no siblings and not many friends because he's missed a lot of school. SD said it was stupid as soon as everyone else wanted to go. Her father said he would have a lot of work to catch up on when he got back. He does seasonal work and has to take the work while he can. The kids agreed that they wanted to go and he wanted us to, so I made the plans and we decided to go back another year with all of us. 

I made the reservations for myself, sister, nephew, and 3 of our children, deciding SD can stay back with dad since she didn't want to go anyway.

My husband says ITA for not planning for her to come too but I don't want her ruining the trip with complaints with my nephew there. Aita?

Edit: To clarify, I asked SD multiple times if she wanted to go as I planned, so I would know at each stage if she had changed her mind. She was adamant every time she didn't want to go. Her dad says she always says she doesn't want to go but would regret missing out. This is based on last summer's vacation when she said she didnt want to go but loved it. We were at a campground and it rained the whole time. We were pretty miserable but she thought it was funny.

33,1gkby4w,AITA for refusing to give my sister any help in anything ever?,"I (16f) have one sister (15). She has a temper and it makes her mean. When we were younger it was over stuff that she believed I could do that she couldn't. But there was nothing. She'd say I got to do more extra curricular's than her but we each had one. I was in a music class after school for 5 years and she did dance. My classes had more breaks than hers did but we still only had one each. She'd get SO mad at me for having more and sometimes when I'd get back from class when she was on break I'd come home to her dumping all my stuff all over the room. One time she threw stuff from the top of the stairs when dad and I were coming in the door and she broke a lot of toys.

I was jealous that mom and dad bought her more stuff at Christmas when we were younger. At the time I thought they loved her more but the stuff all added up to the same amount. I got less because my individual gifts cost more. But when my sister was mean I'd argue that she got more than me. She'd still say I still got to do more stuff and it wasn't fair.

When I was 10 she broke my guitar because she still believed I did more extra curricular's. My parents couldn't afford to replace it back then and I decided to quit music lessons because I didn't like other instruments as much, except piano but that was more expensive to learn and we never owned a piano so practice was impossible. I hated her so much for it but she would act so smug about it. She rubbed it in my face for years. When I got angry enough I'd tell her I wish she wasn't my sister and I hated her. She'd say same.

I started my period when I was 11 and I have endometriosis, only diagnosed this year, which causes me issues. I bleed a lot and have so much pain. My sister started calling me gross and would tell people at school about how gross I am and she'd tell people about bleeding accidents I had. This is an ongoing problem and our parents punish her for it and they try to make us talk our issues out but it's a waste of time. They discipline me too if I express that I hate her. I try not to say it but it's not a lie when I say it. I do hate her. And I'm not ashamed of hating the person who tries to make home and school hell for me.

There are times my sister has needed help and I ignored it and did nothing. Which came up a couple of days ago because my parents wanted me to tutor my sister in math. She always struggled with Math but now she's failing it and they want me to help her so she doesn't end up failing math all the way through high school. But I refused. I told them I would take them punishing me over helping her. My parents brought up how I never help my sister and how she might bully me sometimes but we're sisters and we should love each other and as the older sister I should try to help when I can.

35,1gkbs7m,AITA for forbidding a friend of mine to stream my DnD game to Twitch?,"Oh boy, this headline needs a lot of context.

I wanted to make a DnD campaign for my closest friends and had finished all my preparations. We set a date for the first session; everyone was pretty hyped up, and I was excited as well. The day we were supposed to start, a friend—let’s call her Lisa (girlfriend of one of my closer friends, let’s call him Fabien)—asked if it would be cool to livestream the session on Twitch. Some of us were reluctant, wanting to “groove in” with each other for the first session without an audience, myself included.

She argued that her viewers would miss the lore if we skipped streaming the first session and that the story wouldn’t make sense without it (for context, her Twitch channel has at most 10 viewers). After some back and forth, she said, “Either we stream the first session, or we don’t.” I replied, “Then we don’t.”

Once the group gathered on Discord, everyone was excited but noticed that Fabien and Lisa were delaying. After 20 minutes, Fabien joined, clearly upset, saying we’d hurt Lisa’s feelings. Apparently, she was sobbing and couldn’t speak, so he spoke on her behalf. He launched into a tirade, especially targeting me for “talking down” to her so harshly.

A female friend of mine, who was pregnant at the time, and another female friend defended me, going through our chat history and pointing out that none of us had said anything problematic. Fabien countered that our tone was “harsh,” while we felt Lisa was reading too much into our texts.

Fabien and Lisa decided not to join, so we played the first session without them, though the group was a bit tense. Afterward, the discussion reignited in chat rooms and private messages. The two girls and I discussed how to proceed, as Fabien and Lisa wanted nothing to do with them after “how harshly, dismissively, and angrily” they felt we’d spoken.

I tried to mediate, but eventually, I wanted to get it over with and encouraged both sides to speak directly to each other. This only escalated things, especially when a comment was made about the pregnant friend’s baby that went way too far. I do recognize I was on one side of the conflict, and Fabien and Lisa criticized my wording and bias. The conflict eventually made me cry in front of my colleagues at work.

The fallout was swift: the DnD round was canceled, and my friend circle split in two—but sadly, this isn’t the end.

My best friend, let’s call him Zack, met with both sides separately and heard out their perspectives. He concluded that both sides had made mistakes and tried to encourage them to apologize, but neither was willing to compromise or see the other’s point of view.

Now Zack and I both want to stay friends with everyone, but each side resents that. In Lisa's view, I’m no longer a friend due to my treatment of her and for being friends with both girls. Meanwhile, they are upset with me for wanting to stay friends with someone who treated them so badly.

A female friend of mine, who was pregnant at the time, and another female friend defended me, going through our chat history and pointing out that none of us had said anything problematic. Fabien countered that our tone was “harsh,” while we felt Lisa was reading too much into our texts.

Fabien and Lisa decided not to join, so we played the first session without them, though the group was a bit tense. Afterward, the discussion reignited in chat rooms and private messages. The two girls and I discussed how to proceed, as Fabien and Lisa wanted nothing to do with them after “how harshly, dismissively, and angrily” they felt we’d spoken.

I tried to mediate, but eventually, I wanted to get it over with and encouraged both sides to speak directly to each other. This only escalated things, especially when a comment was made about the pregnant friend’s baby that went way too far. I do recognize I was on one side of the conflict, and Fabien and Lisa criticized my wording and bias. The conflict eventually made me cry in front of my colleagues at work.

The fallout was swift: the DnD round was canceled, and my friend circle split in two—but sadly, this isn’t the end.

My best friend, let’s call him Zack, met with both sides separately and heard out their perspectives. He concluded that both sides had made mistakes and tried to encourage them to apologize, but neither was willing to compromise or see the other’s point of view.

Now Zack and I both want to stay friends with everyone, but each side resents that. In Lisa's view, I’m no longer a friend due to my treatment of her and for being friends with both girls. Meanwhile, they are upset with me for wanting to stay friends with someone who treated them so badly. For now, this is the status quo.",0.0,0.04473772,0,1

I have 0 problem paying for food after he has paid for the previous meal but he doesn’t even let me offer and imposes a sort of avoidable situation at me as to why he can’t pay for the particular meal and i have to pay for it. 

i thought i was overthinking but yesterday, on our 2 month mark, he was liek i wanna have a gourmet burger, not wendy’s, i thought he was going to pay for the food delivery, but then this voice inside me said “worst case scenario, i have to pay for our 2 month dinner”, which was fine with me because i was going to offer anyways but i just thought that yk usually it’s the guy who pays for big meals. anyways, he conveniently told me “im at 1% battery rn”, 3 hours before we ordered food online. when he told me that, i could see whatever he told me 3 hours later coming from a mile away. i told him to charge his phone asap because he was at home and his charger was right next to us. i offered to even give him his charger, he said no. instead, he proceeded to play a game on his phone, causing it to die. 

then after 3 hours, he said “babe you’ll have to order food today, i’m out of energy”, i expected that from a mile away. and he was fully expecting me to pay for his $30 each burger when he came up with that lame excuse. to test that theory out, i said “im tired too, not in the mood to eat”. lie. right after i said that, he was literally not the same person anymore. he was full of energy and even told me to stay awake, “the night has just started”.

40,1gkbdgo,AITA For leaving my family behind to restart,"Just as the title says. My names Drizz, I'm 23 and I just left my family (mom (48) , brother (25) , sister (18)) to basically fend for themselves as I want to restart and do new due to too much conflicting points internally and within the family. 

So In 2022 I decided move to MN from where we were in FL. When I did that, I left my brother, sister, and mom alone and they were ok when I left. Perfectly fine financially and mentally. I decide to visit them in  early 2023 and when I get to them, the house is in shambles from a mental standpoint. 

They were at the point of getting evicted, no one had a job, etc. When I seen this I decided to stay and try and rebuild the family up cause yk... family. 

When I decided to do this, my older brother wasn't living with my mom nor sister. He has a fiance and 2 kids with her, so he went and moved in with her. Seeing that, I got a 2 bedroom apartment. One room for me, a bedroom for my mom and sister as its the most I could afford and the quickest thing I found

We move in October 2023 and from that point all the way until Nov 1st 2024 I pay the rent and most heavy bills. All the family has to worry about is the phone, car insurance, and groceries which comes down to less than 600$ a month while im stuck paying 2400$+ a month in bills.

I generally didn't care about this because it felt good to help the family, but a month or two after moving in , I start hearing my family say I should do more and become more of a man to help more. At first, I shrug it off because I'm a pretty stone made heart dude and don't get fazed by others easily. 

As the months move on and we enter July 2024, I'm all excited for My birthday which was July 10th. Not a single cake, not a gift (not that I care for one but yk a pair socks could of showed me they cared), nothing. Instead I'm told my GF took me out for dinner too long and they don't have time to wait for me, which wouldn't make sense as they didn't even buy me a cake/cupcake/whatever

Thats when I mentally started taking a bad route realizing that my family was just using me it felt like and no matter what I did it wasnt enough. My brother then moves in with us in August 2024 and he is complete hell. He argues that I bring too many different girls to the house (All friends + I pay the rent while he never even have a dollar up for a water bottle) , that I'm disrespectful, lazy, etc.

Want to know what the family did to deal with my brother? Nothing, they told me he had a point and that I should listen to him. A man with no job, no degree, 3 kids, no home. 

So from August 2024 till Nov 2024 my mental really got crushed and I could feel myself beating itself up. I started doubting my looks, my choicez, just everything. 

So, Nov 1st 2024 came around, bought a last min plane ticket to NY, left behind my Computer, 2 laptops, all my consoles, 95% of my shoes (rip to my all my jordan 4's) , No money , no nothing cause I really couldn't stand being there a second longer

42,1gkadq3,AITA for setting a deadline for completing a job,"My son (20M) decided to do a major cleaning of his room.  This involved moving everything but furniture out of the room.

He started last Monday, asked if he could unload his room into the living room, which was OK.  I assumed this would take 1-2 days, he doesn't work or go to school.  By Wednesday, he was still unloading rather than taking things back up.  He said he'd be done by Halloween.

He wasn't done by then, assured us he'd be finished by the time we returned from a weekend trip.  We returned Sunday evening, very little progress, at this point I was getting frustrated as our living room was still filled.  I didn't express this to him, rather to my wife.  She assured me he was making progress, almost done cleaning, was slowly starting to take things back up.

Got home from work last evening, only a few things were moved (~ 1/4 of it).  His room is not large (the house is only 1,200 sq. ft.).  I wasn't happy, took the dog on a walk and texted my wife that I was setting a deadline of today, 11/5.  When I returned, he was eating and talking to friends on the phone.  I got his attention, he muted the call and I told him I expected the living room to be cleared out by Tuesday.  I acknowledged he was doing a big job, but it had been a week and was time to get finished.  I didn't yell, raise my voice, use bad language.  I was as reasonable in tone as possible.

He said ""OK, I'll get it done"" and went upstairs.  My wife got home noticeably unhappy.  Said she would have preferred to speak to him first as it's overwhelming for him.

This morning she came up from downstairs visibly upset.  My son spent the night after we went to bed carting everything  to his room and dumping it wherever there was space.  He told her he now feels uncomfortable living there and wants to get out as soon as possible, she is upset that I ""rushed him"".  I said that I felt a couple days was all that was needed, he's home all day; a week should have been more than enough time.

Possible contributing issues:

1.  My wife and son moved in about 3 1/2 years ago; she had previously lived with him alone (her ex-husband kicked her out when my son was less than a year old).
2.  He had a significant illness that left him with minor brain damage when he was 13.  He has significant social anxiety, this made the transition to adulthood difficult.  He graduated high school online after significant bullying in high school, was an honor student, but has the social anxiety and a (as his mother describes it) ""fear of the world"".
3.  Part of that fear is his gender; he's transgender (FtM), we live in a very ""red state"" in the Southern US.  That was the source of the bullying in high school, also why he's not on speaking terms with his biological father.  I'm his stepfather, though he's considered me his father since I married his mother.  He also overheard his biological father hatefully reject him due to his being transgender.

44,1gkaamq,AITA for standing up to my friend after she snapped at me during a group project?,"I 22F have a friend, Z18F who I get along with very well. until a couple of days when things took a turn during group project were working on with another classmate X also in our group
we were adjusting some equipment Z was watching thru a microscope. Out of nowhere she snapped at us saying “Gosh get up & do the work. Just do it yourselves if you know so much C’mon, get up & do it!” We were completely taken aback I responded by “Fine I’ll do it” thinking it would diffuse the tension.
Afterward I tried to brush it off & talked to her normally. She then apologized saying she didn’t mean to snap/was just annoyed cuz she felt she wasn’t contributing enough I told her I understood/it’s okay we’re friends but requested not snap at me again & tell us instead so we can work things. as I really dislike when ppl get aggressive
Instead of accepting my request Z got even angrier claiming I was mad at her. She left & walked away even tho I called after her & walked over telling her we’re friends we shouldn’t act like that then she said she didn’t want to work with me anymore. I was confused since I had only meant to communicate how I felt
*btw She even talked to me about X when we were alone saying she didn’t like how she took things out of her hand while she was trying to work. I told her yea but talk to her why did u snap at me, she got even angrier when I told her not to do it again. She even mentioned u don’t know me I got anger issues. I told her u don’t know me as well & I hate when ppl be aggressive when I didn’t do anything wrong.
next day I found out from X that Z had been talking about the incident behind my back making me look like the bad person. Z even mentioned she didn’t want to work with me which left me feeling hurt/bewildered
I tried to say hi to Z later, she brushed me off saying she needed to leave. I’ve also been told by X that Z expressed frustration over my remarks for wanting to finish our work early instead of taking vids during our experiments. I never meant to offend her I just have time constraints bcuz my brother waits for me after we finish & i was late
I feel like I haven’t done anything wrong & have been respectful thruout our friendship. I’m tired of this drama especially when I genuinely want to be friends with Z. I even considered buying her coffee as a peace offering but I’m unsure if I should even bother since she’s the one snapped first then made everythin into big deal
My other friends said I try again & apologize to Z, but I feel I’ve already done my part by expressing how her behavior upset me. I’m starting to think that stepping back might be best option since I’ve tried to resolve this. Cuz yk I don’t wanna disrespect myself. idk man
am I bad here for standing up for myself or did I handle it wrong?
i got other friends that I be spending time with but yk I hate when I have problems with ppl I just want peace yk. idk what to do anymore. what is the right thing to do

46,1gk8p3d,AITA for not inviting all my friend group to friendsgiving this year?,"So I (27F) am from a european country but I've always loved the idea of friendsgiving and that's why I've been hosting one every year the last Saturday of November for the last 5 years. I used to do it at my ex bf's house (lest call him Dave) because it's more spacious than my appartment. 

Beginign of last year (2023) me and Dave broke up and a couple months latter he started dating another girl in our friend group (lets call her Sarah). Fast foward to october 24th 2023 (a day before I'm supposed to sent my invites. For context, I always send digital invites exctly a month in avance just to make sure everyone saves the date) we all recieve a messages for a friendsgiving dinner at Dave and Sarah's on the last Saturday of November. I called him to ask if it was a joke, and he replied to me that he wanted to continue hosting friendsgiving. Mind you the idea was always mine and I was the one doing all the work every year, so it never occured to me that he would want to make it. I asked him if he could do his dinner another weekend since friendsgiving was kind of my thing, not only that, but also on that specific date. He told me no, and try to gaslight me into thinking that we always had work on it 50/50 so it was as much a thing of mine as it was his. I spoke with my sister and decided to send my invites the next day and continue with everything as planned. This caused a bit of tension in my friend group, I never wanted to start any trouble so I just comented my point of view on the matter with those who asked me. Some of my friends sided with me and ended up coming to my dinner, but others said that I was beging childish about it and that I should let Dave and Sarah made that years dinner. Because of that  some of my friends ended up dropping and I invited some of my sister's friends that I've also known for a long time, and it turned out being the best friendsgiving I've ever hosted.

Fastfoward to october 28th of this year Dave and Shara have send a messages saying they are doing a friendsgiving dinner at their house on, you guessed it, the last Saturday of November. I've replay saying I already made plans and on the 29th I sent my invites, this time only to the people that came last year to my dinner. So this last couple of days I've been recieving messages from the rest of the friend group that I haven't invited asking why they havent recieve one. I've explain to them that my appartment doesnt have space to host more people that the ones I did last year (which is true) and since they preferred to go to Dave and Shara's last year I assumed this year would be the same. Also I would love to have only last year's people since 1. they where the ones who show me me that are true friends of mine (which is kind of the point of friendsgiving) and 2. it was one of those rare ocassions where you introduce two different groups of people and everyone clicks instantly.

So AITA for not inviting everyone?



P.S. Sorry if there are any grammatical or vocabulary mistakes, English is not my first language.

Edit: Me and Dave have very difference styles when it comes to hosting. I like to be a bit over the top and have everything ready for when people arrive whereas he is more of the type of person that will let us gather at his house but everyone has to contribute and help.

Akira has hated me for the past year, and will do anything to ruin my life. There was once a time i considered her one of my closest friends, but now we're strangers.

Akira's boyfriend was one of my good friends. We used to talk a lot, being in the same class, and casually interacted, as FRIENDS. (BTW, i had no romantic intentions for this guy, it was purely platonic)

Today, Akira dm'd me on social, and started cussing me out. She accused me of flirting with her bf, and trying to steal her man. (this wasn't the first time it happened. She msged me before this and told me to stay away, so I DID)

She accused me of looking at her bf in a weird way. Mind you, i barely acknowledge his presence. (her exact words were, ""I know he looks good, but he's mine"")

As this was the second time i was accused of smth i didn't do, i was fuming. i refused to accept the blame, and told her that she was in the wrong. Akira eventually gave up, and said ""it's fine now."" IT WAS FAR FROM FINE.

Akira has hated me for the past year, and will do anything to ruin my life. There was once a time i considered her one of my closest friends, but now we're strangers.

Akira's boyfriend was one of my good friends. We used to talk a lot, being in the same class, and casually interacted, as FRIENDS. (BTW, i had no romantic intentions for this guy, it was purely platonic)

Today, Akira dm'd me on social, and started cussing me out. She accused me of flirting with her bf, and trying to steal her man. (this wasn't the first time it happened. She msged me before this and told me to stay away, so I DID)

She accused me of looking at her bf in a weird way. Mind you, i barely acknowledge his presence. (her exact words were, ""I know he looks good, but he's mine"")

As this was the second time i was accused of smth i didn't do, i was fuming. i refused to accept the blame, and told her that she was in the wrong. Akira eventually gave up, and said ""it's fine now."" IT WAS FAR FROM FINE. I told her that it was not fine for her to accuse of things like this, and get away with it and pretend everything's alright.

 Due to health issues in my family and the unreliable nature of saving money, I've set the goal to travel as a vague 2025 because don't want to do the trip until lI've saved a comfortable amount of money so I don't need to compromise on accomodation or stress when I'm there and can fully enjoy it.

One of my friends(35F) has decided she wants to come along, and has started messaging me at least once a week with questions about the trip.

Around this same time my father started his health decline. Throughout this period both my familial and partner relationships were very rough as I was trying to balance being a partner, being a daughter, working, and going to school. Admittedly I fell short in all of these areas except maybe working as I was able to afford school. But it left a sore spot in the hearts of my family as I “checked out” when my dad got sick.

I just graduated college and plan on moving in with my significant other. I brought it up with my parents since I was already feeling uneasy as I’ve never felt like moving away until I met my partner. Additionally I already felt bad for having this desire even without the addition of my dad being sick but that just made it more gut wrenching. 

They have never really liked my partner since that initial rough patch but we made it work as much as it needed to whenever we had gatherings. So when I brought wanting to move in with him, they were taken aback. Mentioning how I have awful judgment, I am an awful daughter, the list goes on. I have now been essentially cut off right before the holidays. The sort of verbal attacks I received as backlash put me on the defensive even though I know there is still some fault I need to take for not helping all I could have, or wanting to move out during these times.

57,1gk3r4i,AITA for giving my aunt a piece of my mind?,"
I, 22M, was talking to my aunt on the phone. She badmouthed my friend, essentially calling him a shitty, untrustworthy person and saying that she thinks he wants to rap3 me. Why? Because he told me that two of the people that we used to work with at Wendy’s were saying horrible things about me behind my back. They called me the r-word and one said to the other, “We should intentionally bully Taylor into quitting.” The other one’s face lit up when she said that. She was like, “Why would he say something knowing it would hurt your feelings? How shitty! He knew that you working there was going to be a past chapter in your life. What positives came out of that?” 
The problem? She told me that my late mom had a drug addiction with very specific details to follow, including asking around the family for pain medicine and, when they stopped giving it to her, money to buy it. My grandmother was the first person to say something about this, and she was having early onset dementia, so I thought I’d ask my aunt for clarification, and that’s when she said all of that and more. I find that hypocritical of her.

I told her that. “My mom’s been dead for ten years, so you knew that was a past chapter of my life. Why would you talk to me about this knowing it would hurt my feelings? What positives came out of you telling me that my mom had a drug addiction?” I also told her that one positive that I can think of that came out of my friend telling me that is that he helped me to realize who my real friends were and who my fake friends were, who really liked me and who didn’t. As someone with autism, I think that’s important.

I 18F am dating a 18M we have been together for almost a year now. I met him through some mutual friends who I don't talk to anymore. When I first met him I got the impression that he was some mysterious shy nerd. I was very wrong he is shy but not at all a nerd I didn't mind this at all as he was very funny and kind to me. We got together after just a short time of knowing each other. I was so excited to get to know him and all his interests and quirks however that was it. He had none, no hobbies, no sports he liked, no art nothing. He enjoyed nothing. I thought maybe he was just being shy but after knowing him for a year he still hasn't told me anything he enjoys. One night I decided to ask him directly why/ how he had no hobbies. He just said that nothing gave him joy in life other than me, while this was sweet it is also terrifying. I shouldn't be his only source of joy, what if we get in a fight and I hurt his feelings. I don't even want to imagine what he would do if we broke up. So I decided to tell him to get a hobbie I even suggested a few that we could try together. He said their was no point in trying as he would hate it. I'm worried about him, I can't bare the whole of his emotions its to much on top of what I'm dealing with. I get it we are both young and figuring things out, but this can't be normal right? He got quite mad at my suggestion and said I was calling him boring and saying that his life had no purpose. I would like to add that I am very busy with lots of hobbies and work and barely get to see him. When I'm not seeing him all he does is sit on his computer watching YouTube. Am I the asshole? 

Edit: after reading all the comments I am so grateful to have posted. You where right. I spoke to him and unprovoked he told me that he had been struggling with mental health and it had gotten worse recently. What I thought was him withdrawing from me and his friends was actually him struggling. He said that he had decided to go to a doctor to get diagnosed with anxiety officially and maybe get on some meds for it. I can't believe I missed the signs earlier on in our relationship. we had discussed our past struggles with depression and how we had got through it. His experience was much more recant than mine. After more talking he agreed that finding little joy in his life was not normal and he agreed to see some one about it. Reading everyone's comments made things a lot clearer to me, he is unable to find stuff he enjoys because he is struggling with mental health. I feel shit for missing this, I always knew that he had bad anxiety and encouraged him to seak therapy but didn't realise how bad it actually was. I so happy that he has come to the conclusion of needing therapy himself as it save me a really difficult conversation. I told him that i wanted to help and support him in anyway I could that if he needed something to tell me. Things are looking really good.

i'm one year into tattooing, this is the first coverup i do of a tattoo that i did. i tattooed a saying in arabic on a girl's back a few weeks ago and we both tought it translated to ""appreciate life"" because the translation was right under the words in arabic in the photo she sent me. she texted me a few days ago saying that she wants me to delete the pic of her tattoo off of my page because it actually translates to something awful.

i was so shocked, i ran the pic thru translate lens myself like 5 times and the tattoo did, in fact, mean something gross. i usually do check what clients' tattoos mean beforehand when they are in a foreign language, but i did not check this one because the translation came with the refference pic. i quickly deleted the post and told her that i'm happy to work on a coverup together if she's down for it. she was, and i finished the design today. she likes it and we are gonna do it

the thing is, i feel very guilty about this whole thing bc it never happened to me before. i feel really sorry that i put that on someone's body and i am very happy to cover it, but i feel SO ashamed of charging her for this coverup because i somehow feel like it's my fault. i, as the artist, should of checked the translation and i'm afraid that there is a possibility that she tought the coverup was free, so when i tell her a price she will blame me for the tattoo and end up on bad terms. it was her first tattoo and we have a common friend so she may think that i offered my coverup services as an apology, but tbh i don't even know if i did anything wrong??? maybe i'm overthinking.

i'm so conflicted and idk what to do. on one side i do feel for her and i want to help her, but on the other side this is a complex tattoo that i don't really afford to give out for free. if she was my friend i would totally do it for free but she's a friend's girlfriend's friend, so i don't even know what our status is to be able to give out my resources like that. WIBTA if i charge her for this coverup? IF i do, i will cut it down a lot tho


EDIT: to be more specific:
- i did not make the writing design myself, i just copied the picture she sent me
- the picture she sent me had the design and ""appreciate life"" under it as translation
- i'm calling the tattoo nasty bc it is. it actually translates to ""i'm rotten""
- after further research i found that the pic she sent me circulated on tumblr a few years ago as a meme but we obviously were not aware of that. it's just words on white backround

EDIT 2: i've never had so many ppl comment on my post. i've tried to read everything and i finally made my decision. thank you all for the help, truly! i will update on sunday, when the coverup is scheduled, hopefully being able to answer some questions after meeting with my client again. see you on sunday!",No A-holes here,2024-11-05,"WIBTA if i charge for a coverup of a nasty tattoo i did?

61,1gk2e7k,WIBTA if I tell my friend that she needs to be less clingy and learn to be more independent?,"I am 16M, and my two best friends are my twin sister, who is 16F (who I'll call Katie), and our 16F friend (who I'll call Montannah).

Don't get me wrong, Montannah's a sweetheart, but she's just getting incredibly clingy towards me and Katie, and I'm worried about her.

What's playing on my mind is a party we're going to this weekend. It's one of our friends' eighteenth birthday party and Katie and I have both been looking forward to it for weeks. Most of our friends are attending, and we haven't seen a few of them in a while because they attend different schools. We were both looking forward to a night of fun and partying with them all. However, the host of the party messaged Katie last night asking if we were planning to bring Montannah, to which she replied no. So he went and invited her, and now she's coming to the party.

Normally, I'd be more than okay with this, except for the fact that Montannah will only know a few people at the party, and she isn't good with large groups of people. She said she was not enthused about there being a lot of people there, so Katie kindly asked her how she planned to cope with that. Montannah responded that she could just stick with us two. I was already planning to hang out with my other friends since I spend much less time with them than I do with her. I also have very different friendship dynamics with them. I'm  just worried that she's going to cling to either Katie or me the entire time due to her being socially awkward; which she already does regularly. I know if she does do that, I'm well in my right to ask her to give me some space while I'm with my other friends. But at the same time, I'm also afraid of her feeling like I'm abandoning her and getting upset, which has happened before.

An example of this is last year's New Year's Eve celebrations. Katie and I were planning to hang out with Montannah, just the three of us, but she cancelled a few days before. So, Katie and I went and made plans with other people. Then Montannah was suddenly able to come along at the last minute, so she came along with us and the group we'd made plans with. When the group wanted to hang out at one of our friends' houses, she stayed behind because she was getting overwhelmed with the whole situation. Montannah then got quite upset that we weren't spending time with her, which I understand; I get that she wants to spend time with the two of us. But I also wish she was able to accept that she is not the only person that we spend time with and that we won't drop plans with other friends just for her.

I just really want her to be happy, but I also want a social life with other people, which makes me wonderful if I would be the asshole if I expressed how I feel to her.

So, would I be the asshole if I were to tell her that she needs to learn to be less clingy and more independent?

I'm also really sorry if my English is not the best.

Edit: I'm planning on talking to Montannah and making it clear that I have other friends I also want to spend time with. I've decided at the party I'm going to introduce Montannah to my friends so hopefully she can get to know some of them. I've also worked out that if she starts to get clingy I'll try to talk to her kindly about how I need some space and kindly encourage she makes the effort to talk to and get to know others than just Katie and I.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-05,"WIBTA if I tell my friend that she needs to be less clingy and learn to be more independent?

62,1gk1ypf,AITA for moving forward with putting my parents out? ,"

I 35M and my wife 30F and our two children have been living in my parents home (70F &71M) for the past two years. I have paid my mother $400/month including the fact that I help with groceries, do their laundry and sometimes drive them free of charge although they never offer gas to places they need to go. It has been this way since we moved in. They have never helped with anything with my children while we struggled although they are financially well off and asking me to pay rent at all seeing that I have two children to provide for, was selfish on their part.

The past several months, my parents mainly my mother has asked that we all move out without giving us proper notice or help for a deposit since we don't have the best credit and pretty much intended to throw us on the streets. I asked her to give me until at least April of next year and I would for sure figure something out, even if we had to go to settle for a 1 bed. My mother refused, giving us until the end of this month to move out.
She has gone in my room without my permission, taken items that have been gifted to me by my brother (such as Gucci, Neiman Marcus, very expensive things) and taken it from me. At this point I filed a RO against them both which was approved saying that they can't come into my room or they'll be in violation. She has denied taking my things but I know she did.


The police have filed warrants for them both for grand larceny since I filed reports about my stolen items that exceed $900. Once they execute the warrant, I plan to get my RO modified so they can't come into the home at all anymore. Being that my children and I all feel unsafe and she took from us. AITA?

63,1gk1ch4,AITA for refusing to spend Christmas with my family?,"
I (18F) live alone with my 6 month old son. Christmas is always planned early within my family as there is a lot to plan for with a big family, so despite it only being November, we have already began making plans.

For context, when I was 16 I was living with my friend and was told I could not come to my mothers for Christmas as there was not enough space and travel would be hard (although I’m a 10 minute drive away), I was understanding and spent the Holliday with my friend and his mother. The next year, I was finally living in my own house and despite being pregnant with my son, I was greeted with the same excuse, so yet again I spent Christmas with my friend and his mother.

This year, my mum wants me and my son to spend Christmas with her and the rest of the family as it’s his first holiday and she wants to spend the day with him. Normally I’d agree but this year I firmly told her I would rather spent Christmas just myself and my baby. She got upset with me and said he should spend his first Christmas with his family. But I can’t help but not want to, the last two years I’ve felt completely disregarded and unwanted by my family around the holiday and was never invited to spend the day with them, but now that I have a son transport/space suddenly isn’t an issue. It just makes me feel like they only want me around to see my son/if it benefits them. Despite her pleading, my answer has yet to change and my family are telling me I’m an asshole for being petty and isolating my son on the holiday.

I just don’t want to go after the way I was forced to feel for two years. He’s a baby and although I’ll make the day special, he won’t remember it so I really don’t see how it’s going to harm him. My mother and I were never close but she’s been all over me since the birth of my son, constantly wanting to see him and ignoring me, invaliding me and not even checking up on me when she knows I’m struggling with postnatal depression, I can’t help but feel like I’m only loved because I had a baby and I just don’t want to spend the entire day questioning if I’m there because I’m wanted or if it’s just because I’m a mother now.

67,1gk0dr8,AITA for Not Returning My Mom’s Golden Bracelet?,"(Throwaway account for privacy reasons, with some details changed.)

I (35M) need an outside perspective because this situation is causing me a lot of stress.

For context, I’m the eldest of three siblings – my sister (33F) and my brother (31M).

Five years ago, when I got married, my father gifted my wife and me a pair of gold bracelets that had belonged to my late mother. These bracelets were passed down from my mother’s grandmother, making them deeply sentimental. My mom passed away when I was young, so it felt like a part of her was present at our wedding.

In Chinese culture, it’s traditional to gift gold jewellery to the bride during the tea ceremony at weddings. My wife and I were very touched by this gesture from my father.

Fast forward to the present: my brother is getting married soon, and my father (71M) is now demanding that I return the bracelets. He says he doesn't want to buy new ones and claims he never intended for us to keep them permanently.

I refused, explaining that he never mentioned the bracelets were on loan. If he wanted them back, why gift them to us in the first place? [A red envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope) would have sufficed.

I would understand if my dad said these bracelets were meant to be inherited by my siblings and me, but the only reason he gave is that he doesn’t want to buy new gold jewellery.  
    
I believe this conversation should have happened before gifting the bracelets to my wife and me.

My father is upset with my response and has decided to drag my siblings into this.

He even told my brother that it’s my fault his fiancée won’t be receiving any gold bracelets. When I spoke to my brother, he said he didn’t want to get between me and our dad and that he doesn't really care about the gifts. I feel like he's only saying this to avoid any arguments between him and I.

However, my sister is siding with my father. She privately messaged me, accusing me of valuing money over family. She said, “You can’t consider it a gift if Dad is asking for it back,” and told me to seriously rethink my values. She even compared me to a cousin who had stolen money from the family and ran away.

A part of me wants to return the bracelets just to keep the peace, especially with my siblings. I’m so tired of the stress, the mind games, and the fighting. But a larger part of me is enraged by all of this and doesn’t want to give in at all.

AITA for not returning the bracelets?

",Not the A-hole,2024-11-05,"AITA for Not Returning My Mom’s Golden Bracelet? (Throwaway account for privacy reasons, with some details changed.)

I (35M) need an outside perspective because this situation is causing me a lot of stress.

For context, I’m the eldest of three siblings – my sister (33F) and my brother (31M).

Five years ago, when I got married, my father gifted my wife and me a pair of gold bracelets that had belonged to my late mother. These bracelets were passed down from my mother’s grandmother, making them deeply sentimental. My mom passed away when I was young, so it felt like a part of her was present at our wedding.

In Chinese culture, it’s traditional to gift gold jewellery to the bride during the tea ceremony at weddings. My wife and I were very touched by this gesture from my father.

Fast forward to the present: my brother is getting married soon, and my father (71M) is now demanding that I return the bracelets. He says he doesn't want to buy new ones and claims he never intended for us to keep them permanently.

I refused, explaining that he never mentioned the bracelets were on loan. If he wanted them back, why gift them to us in the first place? [A red envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope) would have sufficed.

I would understand if my dad said these bracelets were meant to be inherited by my siblings and me, but the only reason he gave is that he doesn’t want to buy new gold jewellery.  
    
I believe this conversation should have happened before gifting the bracelets to my wife and me.

My father is upset with my response and has decided to drag my siblings into this.

He even told my brother that it’s my fault his fiancée won’t be receiving any gold bracelets. When I spoke to my brother, he said he didn’t want to get between me and our dad and that he doesn't really care about the gifts. I feel like he's only saying this to avoid any arguments between him and I.

However, my sister is siding with my father. She privately messaged me, accusing me of valuing money over family. She said, “You can’t consider it a gift if Dad is asking for it back,” and told me to seriously rethink my values. She even compared me to a cousin who had stolen money from the family and ran away.

68,1gjzmmh,AITAH for not accepting my sisters new partner even though?,"Recently my dad passed away. My sister brought her new partner of two months (who none of us had met) to the house to say goodbye to my dad in his last days. Her partner ( would not leave her side or give any of us time alone with her to grieve or talk. For perspective- I didnt even bring my husband of four year with whom I share two kids to say goodbye to my dad because we all wanted it to be an intimate and family thing. While my sister and her partner were there at the house while my dad was actively dying they were exhibiting PDA- rubbing each other’s collar bones; cuddling on the couch. My other sister said something about feeling uncomfortable because she just wanted to say goodbye to our dad without feeling like a third wheel in the family living room. My sister and her partner get upset ask her to apologize to them then they left. She’s made it clear to everyone that her partner is a permanent fixture in her life and will be around at every event.

Her partner is much older than her and has some health issues. Her partner complained about struggling financially and my sister makes a very large salary. So when they moved in together I was afraid that her partner would start to control her more because of the financial security my sister brings, her partner was previously in a relationship with a married person which makes me question my sisters judgment because my sister was totally fine with that setup. It makes me hesitant to trust that her partner is being faithful to her. Her partner has family in the area too. 

And her partner goes over to their family’s house without my sister, but my sister can’t seem to go anywhere without her partner. The relationship seems very clingy/codependent. My sister loves to feel needed and to be a caretaker and her partner seems to need to be taken care of. So I guess their relationship works for their personalities and that’s fine. I want her to be happy. 

I have been my sister’s ally since forever. When I was in bad relationships, she was always there for me. She never made me feel bad for making bad decisions in love and was always there for me in the aftermath. So I understand why she might feel hurt by my less than enthusiastic reception to her relationship. I understand that my sister is in a new relationship and feels like it’s them against the world. Everyone wants to feel accepted and to have validation. I feel like I may be harming my relationship with her by not blindly accepting her new relationship and just accepting them with open arms. I would be angry if she told me she didn’t ever want me to bring my husband around. 

I love my sister. I want a relationship with her. She is always welcome to come over or to come join us on family outings, but I don’t want to always have her partner around every time. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting my kids around people who act like this?? Or should I accept my sisters new partner even though I feel uncomfortable?

70,1gjzaic,AITA for accidentally causing a fire at my friend’s house and feeling frustrated by her reaction?,"I (29f) had a close friendship with a former colleague (31f) who was a lawyer at my old job. She became a mentor to me, encouraging me to go to law school. When she opened her business, I helped out with various tasks, mostly unpaid or for small gifts. I didn’t mind much—I wanted to support her.

A couple of years in, she went through a tough breakup. Her ex cheated and gave her HPV. I spent hours on the phone, letting her vent and promising to be there for anything she needed. After her vacation, she invited me over to her new house to decompress. On the way, she asked me to pick up an expensive pizza. Even though it strained my finances, I didn’t mention it because I didn’t want her to feel uncomfortable.

When I arrived, she reheated the pizza in her gas oven, but the boxes didn’t fit well. I suggested it might not be safe, but she insisted it would be fine. While we were chatting, I noticed smoke from the oven. I panicked, thinking to throw water on it, but she stopped me, saying she had a fire extinguisher. It was still wrapped in plastic, and smoke filled the house as she struggled with it. She eventually handed it to me, and I managed to put out the fire.

Once things settled, she called the pizza place and negotiated a replacement for free. I was a bit uncomfortable, but went along. We spent the rest of the evening as planned, and she act totally normal as if nothing happened.

A couple of days later, she messaged saying she needed “distance” to reflect on our friendship. I was confused and hurt, as I’d tried my best to support her. I apologized, saying I was sorry for any disrespect. She mentioned the incident “scarred” her new home and that she needed a new oven. She suggested we meet to talk, but over the next weeks, she rescheduled or canceled five times, leaving me emotionally drained. Each time, I prepared myself, only to be let down.

Finally, I gently told her just to let me know when she was actually available, as it was hard to keep getting canceled on. I was already struggling with my mental health, so the repeated cancellations took a toll. It felt like she saw me as an assistant outside of work, rather than as an equal friend.

Since then, she’s completely stopped reaching out. I’m sad to have lost both a friend and mentor, but I also feel conflicted. Did I ruin a friendship by not being open about my feelings earlier? Or was I justified in feeling frustrated at how she treated me?

71,1gjyyhu,AITA for Not Sharing My Family’s Pasta Sauce Recipe with My Friend?,"

I (28F) have this old family recipe for pasta sauce that’s been passed down for generations. My mom taught me when I was a kid, and over time, it’s become “my thing.” I make it for all sorts of occasions—birthdays, family gatherings, and even just nights in with friends. Everyone raves about it, and I take a lot of pride in keeping it close to the original.

One of my closest friends, Emily, recently asked me for the recipe. She’s been experimenting in the kitchen lately and thought it would be fun to try making it herself. At first, I kind of laughed it off, saying something like, “Oh, maybe I’ll teach you someday,” but she kept pressing. Emily isn’t Italian and doesn’t have a lot of experience cooking from scratch, so I was a little hesitant. It felt weird giving away something that feels so tied to my family, especially since my mom always treated it as a bit of a “family-only” thing.

I tried explaining that it was a family recipe, and I didn’t feel comfortable giving it out. She got pretty annoyed, saying it was just sauce and not some “huge family heirloom.” She pointed out that I’d shared recipes with her before (which is true, but those were random ones I found online, not family recipes).

Now things are awkward between us. She’s been short with me ever since and even made a snarky comment at a dinner party about how I “gatekeep sauce.” A few mutual friends think I should’ve just given it to her to avoid drama, but others understand why I wanted to keep it private.

I am currently fuming its been almost 24 hours since the incident occurred. I have been labelled the asshole by the other party I'll call everyone alias so my friend Cat (30F) and her fiancé I'll call Rob (24M). Me is Jade (25F) and my partner is Bill (24M).

Now, Cat came over unannounced yesterday as she'd had her fiancé's car broken into and they stole items of hers from the car. Awful that would happen and we were chatting and letting her know we had seen Rob earlier to share our sincere apologies for the loss of the items and the trauma it must have caused, as we did with as we sat and chatted now with Cat. Jokes and fun pursued, until I made a joke about the girls at Bill's work seeing Cat's engagement ring, as she went into Bills work to grab food as he works in hospitality and its a small town. They had lunch together as they are old friends and he was on break and one of the girls in the kitchen asked after cat left if that was his partner. (He said no definitely not, she's my best friends fiancé.) Anyways Cat after hearing me jest at the situation as we're friends said 'well actually Bill I have been meaning to ask' turns her chair and raises her hand to shush me, 'what did you think of me 4 years ago' .. 'like you used to chase me around discord you must have liked me, I used to have to run to Rob's chat to get away from you' .. At this point I am dead silent and shocked. My partner responds with 'Idk not really' Which made me mad too! So I left quietly to use the rest room, as they talk about how they met 4 years ago. She decides to notice me leaving and searches for me until she notices the bathroom locked as I sob. And says 'oh its ok she's just here' and returns to her chat.

I flush the toilet and pretend to let it go, I go check the chickens and collect the eggs as it's close to our back door. I return with the eggs and I hear her sing out ' are you ok Jade?' and I respond with 'NO' followed by 'I don't appreciate some bich asking my partner inappropriate questions cause she decides she chose the wrong friend I think you should leave'. I then closed myself in the bedroom and my partner asked for me to come out and talk about it with them. I did not. She uttered a sorry and left.

Now I have spoken to my partner and smoothed over that he also felt awful about her saying or asking such a question. He didn't know how to handle it. However, Rob her fiancé after Bill told him, Rob seems to think after speaking with Cat that it was fine she wanted to apologise if she hurt Bill 4 years ago by choosing Rob. I think that is rubbish. And now I am angry at Rob for also stating 'its the girls problem Jade shouldn't have taken that so far'. so I guess I am here for the internet dump and I am unbelievable upset.

He moved near me and has recently been hanging around and I could tell Wayne was interested. They'd flirt and I'm pretty sure had already been on a date or two. The other day I confronted Wayne and told him to back off my brother.He at first thought I was being mean but I told him the truth about Kevin.. He quit talking to Kevin after that. Kevin of course called me screaming that I had no right to interfere with his  love life and my parents calling mad at me for spreading lies about Kevin to people. AITA?",0.0,0.17737967,0,1
75,1gjy9l8,AITA for opening my husband’s package? ,"I (28) and my husband (30) just married earlier this year. Since we took our relationship to the next level, we decided to not renew our lease with our roommate and get our own spot. During the past 6 months of living together, just us two and my cat, I mostly get a ton of packages sent to our door. 

Whenever I place orders, especially through Amazon, I always give my husband a heads up. Not for any other reason. Yesterday, I gave him a heads up that I was ordering 3 things for my sibling. I was the first to get home today and noticed 3 packages. I ordered my sibling semi big things, and immediately opened up the boxes to wash before I head their way tonight. Shortly after opening the first box, I noticed a bright color that couldn’t have been what I ordered. I quickly checked the address, it was addressed to my husband, and I set it aside and continued to open the other 2 boxes. Somehow Amazon figured out a way to condense my order only into 2 packages. I thought nothing of it. 
My husband and I then had our daily ‘after-work’ phone call, where we discuss what happened throughout our days and he quickly threw out that he should have a package waiting for him. I then told him I accidentally opened it, but set it aside for him to completely open when he got home. 

The conversation then took a turn when he began to scold me about opening his packages. I reminded him of my order and explained to him that it wasn’t intentional. That I was just expecting my orders for my sibling and wanted to prepare their stuff before I gave it to them later. This explanation wasn’t good enough. 

My husband made it seem that I was being negligent, and that “common sense is to look at the address before opening any package or mail”. Although I agree with this, I don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door. I was expecting the package and opened it because I thought it was mine. I also feel since we are married, it shouldn’t matter that I opened the package on accident. It’s not like I took everything out. I simply took my key swiped it across the tape and noticed it wasn’t mine, and set it aside. 

After arguing in circles, his solution was for me to check every label before opening anything and my solution is a heads up after placing an order. I told him I’ll work on looking at the label, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to tell me when he’s expecting a package. We left the conversation annoyed at each other. I know this issue is so minute, but he really thinks that I’m lacking common sense. So like, AITA?! ",Everyone Sucks,2024-11-05,"AITA for opening my husband’s package?

76,1gjy0y7,AITA for asking my roommate to close the door when she's having sex,"Me (21f) and my roommate (28f) have been living together for about 8 months now and we get along really well. We've had some issues, admittedly because I am way messier than she is. I always thought that we had good communication though, and we have seemed to talk it out mostly reaching a conclusion. During these 8 months my boyfriend (23m) has come around the house many times. Every time he sleeps over, I make sure she didn't have any problems the night before and always ask her if we were being loud. We have never had a problem with him coming over before.

Today, my roommate brought over the guy she is seeing. He has been around a bit and I don't really mind it usually. Today, however, they came home when i was sleeping (seasonal depression has me sleeping at 8:30pm), and I woke up to the sound of them fucking. This has never happened before, and i decided to go outside to give them more privacy. On my way out, i noticed that her door was wide open. when I got outside, I texted her this: ""hey... sorry to say this but can you please close your door? I can hear everything."", ""I came outside now but if you can, please."" I don't know what i expected, but she simply replied ""sorry I never told you when you were too noisy with your visits"". I immediately felt horrible and apologized, and said you could have said something before and she just says ""ok. i try to be more understanding"". I didn't mean to embarrass her but i literally woke up to the sound of them, I just thought maybe she could close the door, which she has in the past but now she says she can't because of the cat.  I think I should have just put on some music and not said anything, but I just didn't think it would be a big deal. I always thought she would also tell me if/when I make her uncomfortable.

79,1gjxm7m,AITA for calling security on my roommates?,"I (23 N/B) have randomly assigned roommates (Separate bed/bath, shared living). All three are 19yo students (2F, 1M).

They had a loud party that ran past 10:00PM. Our apt. quiet hours from 10PM-7AM. The next morning I found my dishes moved, my food squashed in the fridge, and my washcloth missing.

They share groceries and dishes with each other, but I have a firm ""don't touch my stuff"" line that they all agreed to. I moved all my stuff to my bedroom.

That morning, I explained when quiet-hours are and shared the number for security. My roommates said it was dramatic moving my stuff, that I should've expected the party to be loud, and that we need to accommodate each other's lifestyles.

A week later, someone stumbles in at 2:00AM, carried by their friends. It woke me up. I asked Beth about it later (fake names), but didn't feel like playing detective.

Another night they were on the patio laughing and talking, the TV blasting, and guests were over, so I called security on them. I was not going to be ignored. My roommates hid in their rooms. After ringing awhile, I answered the door, told him I had called. We got a warning email.

My roommates heard me admit to calling security on the doorbell camera. Five paragraphs were sent between them calling me dramatic, saying they had had to accommodate me and I should do the same. I told them that the rules were in the lease they signed. If there’s a problem with the rules, talk to the manager. Eight paragraphs after that. They ask if I’m planning to renew my lease next year, and offer to pay the fee if I want to move out early.

What we landed on later was I’d text the group first when they were loud.

So it happened again and I texted them. Conner responds that I ""could have gotten up and said something"". Anna said she knew I’d been up cause my light was on.

Yet another quiet-hours violation, and I texted the group that I would be going straight to security next time. As it was, I was still getting woken up at 2AM with no consequences. In my book, you only get to plead incompetence so many times.

Last week the apt. manager asked to schedule a meeting to ""go over updates"" and ""see how things are going"". Translation: ""they want to kick me out, let’s do an intervention then assess"" I had asked about it years ago, but never went forward.

Ann pushed us to schedule the meeting. I said it sounded like a waste of time so I'd skip it. 

Ann called me crazy for threatening to call security, that they weren't being that loud and they weren’t gonna tiptoe around their own apt.

Ann now claims the meeting is mandatory. I’ve scoured the lease and think she might be lying. I told her that if she’s not loud I won't call security, and they won't get fined regardless. She wants to talk about it more, but I’m not interested in sitting and being called crazy. I’m non-binary, I get plenty of that as is.

80,1gjxk6s,AITA for telling my sister to stop being weird about our little sister’s eagerness with her boyfriend?,"I don’t use reddit so my husband made this account for me to post.

I (31F) have two sisters, “Claire” (27F) and “Anne” (20F). Growing up, I had to take on a motherly role for Anne since we don’t have a dad and our mother was absent - which in turn made every ex-boyfriend and my now husband also have a type of fatherly role for her (taking her to a father-daughter dance, teaching her how to ride a bike, she wants my husband to walk her down the aisle, etc).

Claire is, for the first time, dating a guy “Roger” for long enough that we got to meet him. Anne was extremely excited “to get a new person in the family” and the first dinner was ok, she was her usual chatty self and she was all over him (my husband even joked he was being replaced). Claire was a bit moody and snarky but that's just how she is, so I didn't think much about it. The problem started with dinner at my house. Anne cooked the whole food. She was nervous because she felt he didn’t like her much so she was trying extra hard. She kept telling him that she cooked this and that (she just wanted a compliment on it) and Claire rolled her eyes and snapped with something like “he gets it, you’re very wife material”.

Later the five of us are drinking wine on the porch and dancing. At some point a certain song started and Anne gasped and cheered up saying how she tried to teach my husband this dance but he couldn't do it (tiktok dance for what i understood) and asked Roger if he could try it with her. She kinda gets to do it for like ten seconds before Claire starts yelling and tells Anne to stop being such a whore. She goes on about how Anne’s dressed and how she’s acting desperate and thinking it's cute to act like that to other people’s men. I told her no one is trying to steal her man and she’s acting completely insane. They left and we got to talk through the phone the next day (she was ignoring Anne’s calls) and she rants about the same things and I’m again annoyed that she’s acting it was malicious on Anne’s part.

If she had just been annoyed that Anne was being too much, I’d have understood. Like yeah Anne is like an overly-hyper puppy so I get it, it’d have been ok for Claire to tell her to back off because not everyone wants to be her friend. But it was the fact that she made it seem like it was something malicious on Anne’s part. It felt very disingenuous, especially since Anne is *so* naive and also has never shown any interest in dating ever. She just got so excited to have someone new (especially older and male) in her life and it felt wrong that Claire made her feel so self conscious about it.

But also… I get it, it's a girl being eager with your boyfriend and then trying to do tiktok dances with him. I \*could\* understand how people might think this is totally weird and inappropriate, but I think someone that’s naive enough to downright say “I’m gonna cook for him because I want him to like me” is not someone that’s trying to sneakily steal someone’s man.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: Was asked for INFO in a handfull of comments and I can't belive I didn't mention it. Is Anne special needs/delayed/diagnosed with something? She was in special needs class growing up and her boss tried to get her tested because he thought they could get a tax reduction with her but it didn't end up happening. No diagnosis. I'd say it's ADHD and a bit of a low IQ but I'm not qualified to judge that.

EDIT: Thank you for the harsh judgment guys. I’ve apologized to Claire (which led to a very emotional conversation about our upbringing, which made me apologize for giving Anne more attention), Anne had already been apologizing since that night and now Claire finally responded and apologized too, saying she knew Anne wasn’t flirting with him, she just felt insecure and jealous. The whole conversation with the three of us was very long and emotional and it was so much more than the dinner so thank you guys for giving me a reality check. (Anne’s gonna start therapy).

I have been diagnosed with Anorexia, Bulimia, OCD, borderline personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and severe depression. I am physically challenged with osteoporosis, chronic reflux and have lost control of both my bladder and bowels.

This illness has robbed me of everything. I make $26,000 a year living in Vancouver and live paycheque to paycheque. I am still struggling with acid reflux and every day i wake up with shards of teeth in my mouth. I don’t want to lose my teeth, and was told I need a full mouth rehab which is an extremely costly endeavour. I’m in the process of applying for disability but I don’t know when that will be approved. 

My parents help me out already with rent, and they are very financially well off from selling our childhood home that greatly appreciated over the years. Both are retired and work part-time. My twin brother is an engineer and he does very well for himself, and my sister is a nurse who also does very well. I have tried every single way to amass funds on my own (Gofundme, messaging government officials and asking for reduced cost care) but nothing has worked out. 

I have an upcoming consultation with a prosthodontist at my local dental school but I’m expecting a bill that likely will not be within my budget for years. I don’t want to lose my teeth, and my OCD is so bad right now I’m genuinely considering offing myself at this point because I’m so tired of being in pain.

I don’t want to lose my teeth, and was told I need a full mouth rehab which is an extremely costly endeavour. I’m in the process of applying for disability but I don’t know when that will be approved. 

My parents help me out already with rent, and they are very financially well off from selling our childhood home that greatly appreciated over the years. Both are retired and work part-time. My twin brother is an engineer and he does very well for himself, and my sister is a nurse who also does very well. I have tried every single way to amass funds on my own (Gofundme, messaging government officials and asking for reduced cost care) but nothing has worked out. 

I have an upcoming consultation with a prosthodontist at my local dental school but I’m expecting a bill that likely will not be within my budget for years. I don’t want to lose my teeth, and my OCD is so bad right now I’m genuinely considering offing myself at this point because I’m so tired of being in pain. 

Would I be the asshole to ask my family if they would be willing to help me out financially. They already do so much and  live their own lives and I don’t want to lose them by coming across as a beggar ",0.0,0.81346565,1,0

I, a 24 year old man, was visiting my hometown for a holiday at my mother’s house. On my last day in town I was planning on leaving late that night so I could dodge traffic going through L.A. and I decided to take a nap so I didn’t get sleepy on the road. Since my mom and sister would be asleep by the time I woke up to leave I decided to tell both goodbye before I got in bed. When I said goodbye to my mom she responded with “well make sure you don’t fall asleep and crash on the road”. This statement just made me really confused and I just instinctually responded with “um, yeah? That’s…why I’m taking a nap.” In an admittedly sarcastic tone. She just rolled her eyes hugged me goodbye than walked away. Normally her statement on its own wouldn’t really annoy me but she had recently started to making comments to me like “well make sure you don’t get addicted.” if I even MENTION taking so much as a single sleeping pill. In all my 24 years of life I have never been close to having a substance abuse issue of any kind and while I understand it can pretty much happen to anyone, she definitely doesn’t think I have one so what’s the point in saying that seemingly passive aggressive comment to me?

85,1gjwrpv,WIBTA-for skipping my kid's birthday party because it's at my ex-husbands?,"My ex and I divorced in 2021. We had struggles and those struggles got disseminated to his friends and family pretty widely while we were still ""trying"" to work together. Once divorce was final, I tried to be the nice ex and do the joint friends/family kids birthdays. The first year, his friends made cutting comments behind my back (in my home) because I was frustrated with him. The reason for my frustration being that he offered to help set up since it was at my house, he arrived 10 minutes before everyone and then proceeded to act like he still lived there. Zero help given, partial credit accepted. (The next year less help and I decided separate family events after that and avoid the dynamics) He also told me at one point that his sister never came home to visit because I caused a shitshow with their parents. The same parents she wouldn't tell when she was visiting so she could avoid them. The same parents who visited her less than a handful of times during the decade of our marriage. I will be frank, his father is a partial reason I gave up on our marriage. I was told that he is the way he is and I'm going to have to get over it. He did some things that felt pretty violating and our marriage counselor agreed with that description so yeah. I don't want to be around them. 

But its been a constant struggle with establishing boundaries. It took him 2-3 years to not just walk in and then I seem difficult when I tell him the kids will be out in a minute. 

And it's not just him, the boundaries have been crossed by my family as well. My grandmother asked me in church one Sunday if she could invite him to the extended family dinner for Christmas. What was I supposed to say!?!?! My cousins were confused to say the least. It has been this way now and I just have kind of given up. The first time my immediate family drew a firm line was this past Christmas when they told him he couldn't come because my boyfriend would be there and they didn't want awkwardness. It took three years. My boyfriend is a bit of a saint for dealing with it all but he gets frustrated by it for me. 

So here's my dilemma. I have my kiddo on their birthday. I wanted to invite my immediate family over for dinner and cake. I knew he wanted to throw the friends, family, neighbors, school mates, etc party this year. I wasn't going to take away from that but he invited my immediate family and they have decided to all go. Do I go and be uncomfortable the entire time and potentially make it even worse? Or can I make their birthday special beforehand and skip out on the social show? 

And for those concerned about finances...I will be having a sleepover party the week after, so I will still be paying to help cover my kids birthday festivities in my own way.

86,1gjwr5s,AITA for going m.i.a after fight with dad.,"Context:

I (24 f) live in a rural area with my Mum, I don't leave the property much as I work from home. I do all cooking, chores and maintenance for the property. My Mum works in town 5 days a week and is in the process of splitting with my Dad who is retired used to run the farm and now lives in the city, he isn't supposed to stay nights but often will (honestly cant even say why anymore as hes used every excuse under the sun.) 

Issue: 

Last week my dad came to stay the night as he was going to do some work for my uncle. 

It was a very busy day (one of those days when you don't eat) he rocked up he immediately started to do 'jobs' that didn't need to be done. Which caused some problems that he blamed on everything but himself.

Not a huge deal but an inconvenience nonetheless.

I'd organise a neighbour to come over and help me with some two person jobs (would of told him not to come round if he had a mobile phone). 

The neighbour is an old mate of my dads so I wasn't surprised that they got to talking, I was surprised that my dad basically made me look like an idiot and pushed me out of the conversation. 

I only got a hello and a thank you in during the time it took to get the jobs done before I  picked that I was wanted around their conversation. He ended up staying an extra hour to talk to my dad.

When dad did come in I was in the middle of cooking dinner whilst my mum was having a shower. Instead of asking if I needed help he just grabbed a drink and sat in front of the TV. 

I planned to have a shower after my mum (as I was absolutely filthy) but my dad decided he'd have a shower next, which irked me alot but if I rushed I could still finish before our fav tv show started (on aired TV so can't pause).

When I get out of the shower I find that he's used my towel, which he has done before (a month ago) because it was ""in his towels spot"" and ""was his towels colour"". 

This time my towel wasn't in his 'spot' and it wasn't even the same colour.

In my hangry state I did lose it, which he'd found funny.

I'd said ""Are you just blind or stupid?"" he'd stopped laughing at that and it made the situation worse and I'll admit wasn't right of me to do.

I ended up just dishing up my food and going to my room to eat and then sleep.

The next morning whilst I had done all the chores, he had broke the toilet and a few taps claiming he was trying to fix them. 

My brain just snapped

I ended up leaving without telling anyone around lunch time to go down to the city and stay with my sister. I had planned to go the next day as I had an appointment. 

(I made sure all animals had plenty of food and water before I left)
 
I'm back on the farm and have appologise to my mum but haven't said anything of the sort to my dad (staying with my uncle). He's aparently very 'hurt' by what I did but he hasn't said a thing (text, call or in person) to me in regards to it.

89,1gjvrae,WIBTA if I kick my roommates girlfriend out?,"Okay, so I (28M) have a roommate situation that’s been driving me absolutely insane, and I need some perspective. I live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my friend Mike (28), and everything was fine until his girlfriend (let’s call her Sarah, 22F) started basically living here too—without ever really *moving in* if that makes sense. 

Mike and Sarah have been dating for about 6 months now, and I have no problem with her being here sometimes—except she’s *always* here now. And she’s, like, constantly eating and leaving stuff everywhere. Like, there’s always food on the counter, and half the time it’s just leftover bags of chips, takeout containers, or the crumbs that have somehow turned into a permanent part of the couch. I mean, I know it’s a shared space, but it’s become impossible to live here with the constant mess.

But that’s not even the worst part. The worst part is how *loud* they are. I'm talking full-on bickering, loud Netflix marathons at 2 AM, and Sarah eating in the loudest way possible—like, she’s trying to make *every* bite of food sound like a life-or-death experience. And don’t even get me started on the smell. It’s like every day they decide to order the greasiest pizza or the most pungent Chinese food, and I can’t escape it because it just lingers for hours.

Now, I know people are going to say I should talk to Mike about it, and I have. I’ve told him multiple times that it's too much and that it’s not fair to me as his roommate. But he just brushes it off, saying that ""she’s going through some stuff"" and ""I should be more understanding"" (I mean, okay, but we’re all adults here, right?). 

And the worst part? Every time I try to hang out with him or even relax, Sarah is somehow *always* there. She doesn’t even live here, but she acts like it’s her second home, leaving her stuff everywhere, occupying the bathroom for *way* too long, and never cleaning up after herself. I feel like I don’t even have a place to chill anymore because she’s *always* here, and Mike doesn’t seem to care. 

I get that relationships are important, but this is my home too, and it feels like I’m being totally ignored.

91,1gjvn9t,AITA for not giving my aunt a family heirloom?,"My parents passed right before Christmas last year. It’s been a hard year for all of us. They lived in Houston, and none of us kids live in state. Their care and estate required a lot of time away from home, and heartache. My brothers and I have been slowly working through the estate and finally got to where we were ready for a sale company to come in.

While preparing the property, I set aside a few heirlooms to care for and pass down. One was a silver christening cup and spoon my father had on display.

On my last trip down, I stayed a few days to visit an aunt in San Antonio, take her shopping, out to dinner, et . She and I have always been close.

When I arrived, I thought she’d enjoy seeing some of the family heirlooms I had saved, so I showed her what I had found.

She immediately started telling me I needed to give them to her, that they were all things she should have been given when my grandparents passed. I knew I had made a mistake showing her.

One item was my father’s silver christening cup. When I went to put it away, she said, “You’re not leaving that with me?” I asked why she thought I would. That night was hard. She screamed at me until I had enough and said she had to stop. She’s 89 years old. 

What is she going to do with this cup? It’s time to stop being greedy. My dad was out of state when my grandparents died.

All he had was what his parents gave him while alive, and now she was demanding those items, too.

I left before she woke up the next morning and left a note thanking her for her hospitality, that I loved her, and hoped we’d speak soon.

She ignored me for weeks and when she did reach out, it was only to berate me about this cup and spoon, demanding it be handed over.

In my last text, I told her she meant too much to me for our relationship to suffer over this and offered to send it to her. I feel like I’m being bullied into it.

Over the last few days, I’ve kept up my messages with her, sending photos of the garden, family updates, and so on. She usually would respond but hasn’t replied.

Earlier today she called me screaming, ordering me send this cup and spoon to her.

I told her if she didn’t stop yelling I’d have to end the call, and when she kept on, I did.

I’ve never hung up on her or raised my voice to her in my life. It broke my heart.

I think much of this is due to her age and mental decline, but I remain loving and respectful. I’ve kept her daughters apprised of the behavior and that I feel terrible the cup situation has her so upset, that I’ve offered to send her the cup, but they haven’t responded at all.

So, AITA? I feel terrible and so sad. She’s the last remaining relative of her generation, but my brothers & I have been through so much over the last year. I just cannot believe she’s behaved this way when she knows we’re deep in grief and overwhelmed by the estate.

92,1gjvczp,WIBTA if I ask my partner to get their drivers license,"My partner has never gotten a license, he’s now 28M and still has no interest in pursuing a license. 
It’s getting frustrating, we don’t live somewhere with any good public transit so 99% of the time he has to get rides or I have to drive him… 
It seems like sometimes he recognizes that it’s inconvenient and uncomfortable for me and his friends, he’ll say stuff like
 “haha I should stop being a bum and get a license and a car huh” 

but then when I try to encourage him to drive he shuts down. 
I offer to teach him, to let him use my car to practice, and to even walk him through the test. He just ignores me and goes silent… what do I do? 

edit: read over everyone’s responses thanks y’all for the honest feedback. 

To answer a few questions: 
No he does not have a physical condition that prevents him from driving. 

And No he does not pay rent… he lives at home with his 68 year old mother. He instead is a “struggling artist” and allows her to break her back working as a bus driver and live off her dime. 

I spoke to him about this being a deal breaker for me and he gave me a very strange answer- 
He said 
“My mom never taught me because her mom died in a car accident, so I would rather people think I’m lazy then make fun of my mom.”

Which to me doesn’t even make sense? Your mom didn’t teach you 10 years ago… you can still learn now. If she’s so scared of cars why is she a city bus driver? 
I think it’s a cop out 

I asked if HE had fear around cars and he said “a little bit” 
and then changed the subject. 

I think I’m done with this relationship, I can’t see marrying someone like this. 
I’m going to end things tonight-

She (20f)goes to school 2 days a wk,doesn't have any chores and doesn't help around the house. We have a 2yr and live in a 2 bd apartment.  She now has the spare room while our toddler sleeps in our bed. We weren't in a financial spot to take her in and it was done anyway ( I was given a 2wk notice that she was coming to live with us as he had already told her yes). I work part time while I take care of house bills and everything for our current child(diapers, clothes etc). My husband pays the rent and takes care of the car. We both buy groceries, (him mostly ) and we are saving for a house. She's (20f) has been living with us for 3mths now and the financial strain is rough. My husband has started taking money out of our house fund(joint saving account  he hasn't been putting money into) and I'm pissed. She(20f) has money to get her hair done every wk but can't afford her hygiene products.  We buy down to deodorant for her. My husband is stressed and it's putting a strain on our marriage as well as a strain on finances.  Why can't she work to take care of her personal needs? I'm working while taking care of a toddler, he works long hrs and we can't afford childcare care nor do we want strangers taking care of our child( decision we made b4 she was born). He talked about how good it would be to have her here( maybe help us out with the baby but that hasn't happen). His credit has gone to shit and I'm trying to maintain mine but the bills are now mounting as extra funds go to taking care of her. Our sex life is in the sitter cause her room is right next door and I'm not having sex with her dad where she can hear me. I've told him already to move her bed to the other wall ...he hasn't done it. Aita for requiring him to make her get a job to cover her personal needs and not having sex until he moves the bed?It's hard enough doing it with a toddler asleep in our bed.

Update:::  Thank you to everyone who commented with encouragement and advice.  It's hard to see things how they truly are when you are in it. I've told my husband his daughter can either get a job or move out..if neither happens then I wouldn't be here .(they have 2wks to do so)  this alsogives me time to put some things in place for myselfand my baby..

95,1gjuz25,AITA for only offering my sister a 10% share of our late father’s Will instead of an even 20%,"I (30M) have two older half sisters (44F)(39F) who each have their own mother, and a younger brother (27M)

Our eldest sister lives in Africa (she is 1/4 African we are not)

Our father passed away 3 months ago. He had a family trust which posses half his assets and it is split evenly amongst the 4 children.

His Will holds another house worth ~1.7 million dollars. This house is split between the younger three siblings and his caretaker who worked for him for 20 years and invested a small sum into a business he owned. There is also a house in Africa which he has left to my eldest sisters grandmother.

My father and eldest sister had an argument two years ago over a house my sister owned. I wasn’t involved and my Dad knew I had a good relationship with my sister so he didn’t involve me in any way.

My eldest sister spoke to me about the argument once when he was alive and mentioned that he threatened to cut her out of the Will.

My two oldest sisters don’t talk and haven’t for years, again because of a financial dispute over the same house.

When our Dad died and I read the Will I immediately told my sisters that I felt it unfair. The Will was written 2 years ago when the big dispute happened and I felt like the relationship between my dad and eldest sister had been improving. I felt that perhaps he would have updated the Will had he lived longer. I don’t think he expected to die (I certainly didn’t) but also he had been in hospital for many months and was 72

Fast forward a couple months and my two sisters are still not talking, but we have proposed that all 4 of us dilute our share of the 1.7 million dollar house from 25% to 22.5% so that out other sister can get 10%

I spoke to the eldest sister on the phone and she was unhappy with only being offered 10% and instead wants an even 20% between the 5 of us.

I haven’t spoken to her since yet but after thinking about it for a day I feel it’s wrong that she feels so entitled. I felt the additional 10% was a nice gesture, especially considering she will still get 25% of the trust. AITA? 

Edit: I realise now that I’ve been out of line trying to change his Will. Part of this is because I never considered the fact that he could die seriously, despite ample evidence. I assumed he and others shared the same cognitive blind spot, an assumption I now realise is incorrect. (From this I incorrectly assumed the Will was just out of date)

96,1gju9l4,"AITAH for using ""I love you"" as a goodbye? ","
So, for context, I have generalized anxiety disorder and often get extremely anxious that any time I see a loved one could be the last time. I believe this is a fairly common way of thinking, especially for people with anxiety. So, I always end conversations with people I'm close to with a quick ""I love you"". I think it's nice, it's a good reminder to them that they are loved and it eases my anxiety a little to know that even if something horrible happens, the last thing that I ever said to them was ""I love you"". Of course, if someone is uncomfortable with that then I readjust and don't say it to them and of course there is no expectation or pressure to say it back.

The issue started when I began saying this to a newer friend group. It was seven people including myself and we had been friends for about 3 months. I know that seems fast but I give my affection pretty freely and I genuinely loved these friends, my family was in tatters and I was struggling with a lot so they felt like my found family. When I said ""I love you guys"" for the first time, most said it back. A couple of them just smiled, didn't look uncomfortable as far as I could tell, and never mentioned any problem with it. In retrospect I probably should have just asked them upfront if they were uncomfortable.

So from then on, I would casually say ""I love you"" to the group anytime we parted ways. We ate meals together and saw eachother a couple times a day, so I was saying this to the group multiple times a day. Maybe a bit excessive, but it was just my way of saying goodbye. One day, a couple weeks into this happening, one member of the group finally snapped.

Apparently it was actually bothering them this whole time, making them very upset and uncomfortable. They yelled at me and went on this long rant about how it's disgusting and weird that I would say that to my friends, that by saying it so much I was pressuring them to say it back, that I don't even mean it because I was just saying goodbye and it was obnoxious to say ""I love you"" every time I actually just mean bye. By this point, I was crying and got defensive. The criticisms they brought up were valid and did make me think about my words more, but I said that they should have been nicer about it, should have communicated with me in the first place instead of bottling it up until they exploded on me, and basically called them an asshole who doesn't know how to communicate.

Obviously, I never said I loved them after that and we are no longer friends (there were other conflicts other than this incident). I still think about this interaction a lot and it makes me worried about expressing my love for my friends I'm the future. Am I the asshole?

97,1gjtnxf,AITA for Not Being There for My Friend?,"About a month ago, my best friend hinted that he was going to break up with his girlfriend of four years. He said it was a tough time, and I sympathized. A few days later, while I was in the Caribbean with my girlfriend, I got a text from him saying, ""I wish you could be here right now, I really need someone to talk to."" I assumed this meant he was struggling with his relationship, so I offered to FaceTime him. He declined, saying, ""I couldn’t do that to you."" I didn’t know it at the time, but he'd already broken up with his girlfriend.

When I returned home, I found out through a group chat that he had started vaping again, something he'd pressured me to quit for years. I texted him about it, warning him about the addiction, and he made an inappropriate joke about my race, calling me an ""ISIS recruiter."" I was offended and decided to leave it alone.

A few days later, he texted me about going to a concert, asking if I wanted to join him. He mentioned he had tickets originally for him and his girlfriend, but didn’t tell me they had broken up yet. I turned him down because I had plans with my girlfriend.

Over the next week, I reached out multiple times to see if he wanted to talk or play video games, but he ignored me. When he did respond, he gave weak excuses like ""Do Not Disturb"" or ""I fell asleep""—neither of which seemed genuine.

Then, I ran into him while he was playing golf with our other friends.

About a month ago, my best friend hinted that he was going to break up with his girlfriend of four years. He said it was a tough time, and I sympathized. A few days later, while I was in the Caribbean with my girlfriend, I got a text from him saying, ""I wish you could be here right now, I really need someone to talk to."" I assumed this meant he was struggling with his relationship, so I offered to FaceTime him. He declined, saying, ""I couldn’t do that to you."" I didn’t know it at the time, but he'd already broken up with his girlfriend.

When I returned home, I found out through a group chat that he had started vaping again, something he'd pressured me to quit for years. I texted him about it, warning him about the addiction, and he made an inappropriate joke about my race, calling me an ""ISIS recruiter."" I was offended and decided to leave it alone.

A few days later, he texted me about going to a concert, asking if I wanted to join him. He mentioned he had tickets originally for him and his girlfriend, but didn’t tell me they had broken up yet. I turned him down because I had plans with my girlfriend.

Over the next week, I reached out multiple times to see if he wanted to talk or play video games, but he ignored me. When he did respond, he gave weak excuses like ""Do Not Disturb"" or ""I fell asleep""—neither of which seemed genuine.

I live on the second floor, and instead of coming up, the driver called me from his van. He acted like he didn’t understand that I could buzz him in or didn’t seem to understand English. Meanwhile, I’m trying to find my shoes, and in my rush to get downstairs, I trip at the doorway. It actually hurt, so I muttered “Holy fuck” while still on the phone with him, and he immediately hung up on me.

When I finally get downstairs, there he is, standing by the door he said he couldn’t get through, somehow having managed to open it. I asked, “What was the issue with the door?” since he clearly got it open by himself. His response was, “Did you just tell me to go fuck myself?”

I was surprised and tried to explain what happened, but he insisted I’d insulted him. He wouldn’t give me the package until I gave him a fist bump, which felt awkward. This driver delivers here often, and each time there’s been some kind of issue, so I’m not sure what to make of it.

**Edit 2:** I also want to mention that I felt genuinely bad that he thought I’d insulted him, and I did my best to explain calmly. I just wasn’t sure how to handle him insisting I was lying, and then refusing to give me the package until I fist-bumped him.

99,1gjtg3m,AITA (20F) for making my (30M) boyfriend sick from chicken pot pie?,"I (23F) made my (33M) partner sick eating chicken pot pie. At the time, I was a single mom and my boyfriend, now husband, was going shopping at the local Sam’s club. He had made it very clear before this that he has had a food aversion to chicken pot pie all of his life. Every time he eats it he gets sick. I, on the other hand, loved pot pie and could eat it all the time. There is only one time of year (during the colder seasons) that this store sells the house made chicken pot pies to take home and bake. I saw the pie, and I basically begged that we take it home. I also made it clear that he did not have to eat it, that he could eat something else if he wanted, but that I was craving the pie and wanted to eat it. After a bit of convincing he agreed to get the pot pie.

Both of us are stoners so we were baked that night, about as baked as that pot pie. After the pie was baked, I can’t lie, the aroma filled my small apartment. We fed ourselves and he grabbed a piece to my surprise. I asked if he was sure and he said it would be fine. After he finished he went back for several more portions. He must have eaten at least half the pie after he was done. I was surprised…

Later that night I see him quickly make his way to the bathroom after tossing and turning in the bed next to me. I got up to check on him and immediately heard him getting sick. He opens the door abruptly and I startle him standing in front of him. I ask if he’s okay while peering into the full SINK of vomit. It was a normal bathroom sink filled to the brim with vomit. I brought him back to bed and let him sleep, but his breath made me ill. I made my way to the livingroom to sleep on the couch but I couldn’t because the smell of the vomit was wafting through my apartment. 

I have emetophobia (the fear of vomit) and realized that if I don’t clean the sink I will be miserable all night. I got to work. I found out that my sink was broken. I fixed the sink, cleaned the puke, and made sure everything was cleaned up. It took every ounce of strength I had and I still ended up getting sick myself cleaning it.

He came back to check to see what I was doing. He saw what I did and said “you cleaned it up. You didn’t have to do that, I was going to do that.” I replied,” I couldn’t sleep because of the smell so I cleaned it up.” He just said okay after and went back to bed. 

The next day I mentioned it to him. We ended up getting in a fight. He had accused me of making him sick because I knew that it would make him sick. I didn’t force him to eat it. This was almost 3 years ago and we still fight about it. He still has not genuinely apologized to me for blaming me and he has not thanked me for cleaning it up. Did I owe him?

He works in a bank.

Luckily my gf defended me but her family were somewhat nonchalant about what he did? Almost like they didn't care?

And I don't even know where to start with her brother, he is very into anime which I'm personally not into but it's fine he is. It's just that he seems to have a fixation with the fact I'm Japanese? Like when I was meeting her family for the first time, he immediately took notice of me and wouldn't stop asking questions?

0,1gjxm7m,AITA for calling security on my roommates?,"I (23 N/B) have randomly assigned roommates (Separate bed/bath, shared living). All three are 19yo students (2F, 1M).

They had a loud party that ran past 10:00PM. Our apt. quiet hours from 10PM-7AM. The next morning I found my dishes moved, my food squashed in the fridge, and my washcloth missing.

They share groceries and dishes with each other, but I have a firm ""don't touch my stuff"" line that they all agreed to. I moved all my stuff to my bedroom.

That morning, I explained when quiet-hours are and shared the number for security. My roommates said it was dramatic moving my stuff, that I should've expected the party to be loud, and that we need to accommodate each other's lifestyles.

A week later, someone stumbles in at 2:00AM, carried by their friends. It woke me up. I asked Beth about it later (fake names), but didn't feel like playing detective.

Another night they were on the patio laughing and talking, the TV blasting, and guests were over, so I called security on them. I was not going to be ignored. My roommates hid in their rooms. After ringing awhile, I answered the door, told him I had called. We got a warning email.

My roommates heard me admit to calling security on the doorbell camera. Five paragraphs were sent between them calling me dramatic, saying they had had to accommodate me and I should do the same. I told them that the rules were in the lease they signed. If there’s a problem with the rules, talk to the manager. Eight paragraphs after that. They ask if I’m planning to renew my lease next year, and offer to pay the fee if I want to move out early.

What we landed on later was I’d text the group first when they were loud.

So it happened again and I texted them. Conner responds that I ""could have gotten up and said something"". Anna said she knew I’d been up cause my light was on.

Yet another quiet-hours violation, and I texted the group that I would be going straight to security next time. As it was, I was still getting woken up at 2AM with no consequences. In my book, you only get to plead incompetence so many times.

Last week the apt. manager asked to schedule a meeting to ""go over updates"" and ""see how things are going"". Translation: ""they want to kick me out, let’s do an intervention then assess"" I had asked about it years ago, but never went forward.

Ann pushed us to schedule the meeting. I said it sounded like a waste of time so I'd skip it. 

Ann called me crazy for threatening to call security, that they weren't being that loud and they weren’t gonna tiptoe around their own apt.

Ann now claims the meeting is mandatory. I’ve scoured the lease and think she might be lying. I told her that if she’s not loud I won't call security, and they won't get fined regardless. She wants to talk about it more, but I’m not interested in sitting and being called crazy. I’m non-binary, I get plenty of that as is.

1,1gke8ac,AITA for setting boundaries on  thanksgiving dinner,"
All right, so this is my first post. I just wanna know if I’m the ahole for not wanting to go to a restaurant with my whole family. For context, I was told two months ago, that myself, my mother, my stepfather, my stepsister and her two children seven and two and possibly my cousin will be going to a restaurant for Thanksgiving. So today I was just told by my mother that my stepsister‘s mother who is raising my stepsister’s seven-year-old will be joining. Now there’s long history in short she’s a narcissist and had caused my stepsister to develop Borderline Personality disorder. The issue I have is since I turned 18 one year after the seven-year-old was born. I had made a clear boundary that I do not want to go to social settings that include my step sister‘s mother which my mother agreed is perfectly fine now for Thanksgiving She is telling me that I need to be an adult and put aside my boundaries of not wanting to be involved with my stepsister‘s mother because it is also the seven-year-old‘s birthday now I had explained to her that I will make it still a happy day and a happy occasion And we’ll celebrate before the dinner and they can go to dinner and when they come back, everyone can tell me how it was, and I will still be happy and polite. For context to that when I am around my stepsister‘s mother, I am miserable doesn’t matter if she’s being polite it doesn’t matter if she’s being rude.

All right, so this is my first post. I just wanna know if I’m the ahole for not wanting to go to a restaurant with my whole family. For context, I was told two months ago, that myself, my mother, my stepfather, my stepsister and her two children seven and two and possibly my cousin will be going to a restaurant for Thanksgiving. So today I was just told by my mother that my stepsister‘s mother who is raising my stepsister’s seven-year-old will be joining. Now there’s long history in short she’s a narcissist and had caused my stepsister to develop Borderline Personality disorder. The issue I have is since I turned 18 one year after the seven-year-old was born. I had made a clear boundary that I do not want to go to social settings that include my step sister‘s mother which my mother agreed is perfectly fine now for Thanksgiving She is telling me that I need to be an adult and put aside my boundaries of not wanting to be involved with my stepsister‘s mother because it is also the seven-year-old‘s birthday now I had explained to her that I will make it still a happy day and a happy occasion And we’ll celebrate before the dinner and they can go to dinner and when they come back, everyone can tell me how it was, and I will still be happy and polite. For context to that when I am around my stepsister‘s mother, I am miserable doesn’t matter if she’s being polite it doesn’t matter if she’s being rude. I am just miserable in her presence and I tend to make other people miserable while I’m in her presence. Am I the ahole for not wanting to go to Thanksgiving dinner?",0.0,0.005060407333076,0,1
2,1gke1wz,AITA for interrupting husbands “free time” because I’m sick?,"I (24f) am pregnant with my second child. My husband (25m) wasn’t the most understanding of pregnancy last time and basically thought I was being “dramatic” till I started showing at which point he was very supportive. This seems to be happening again. 

He has been helping out with our toddler a lot at night and I’m suppose to then take toddler when he’s up at 6am to let husband sleep in. This has happened with varying success because toddler is loud. 

Last night husband went to bed at 9:30pm last night and toddler slept till 4:45am when my husband got up to settle him and then husband went back to sleep till around 7:45. 

Tensions were already running high because husband continued to be “off the clock” but stayed in the dining room. This meant toddler was running up to dad every 30 seconds. I was trying to make everyone food but was repeatedly being called over to distract my toddler away from my husband. I finally told him if he wanted to have free time he needed to go into the bedroom and shut the door. He did so after some grumbling that he should be allowed to enjoy time wherever he wants in his home. But seemed like he was fine after I brought him breakfast in bed. 

I continued to clean and take care of toddler while getting sicker and sicker. I had to interrupt husband for a minute to watch toddler while I puked. Then he went back to the room when I was done. At 9:45 am I had to interrupt him again cause I was sick. 

At this point husband was very upset. He says I shouldn’t be “offering” him free time and then interrupting him repeatedly. I feel I really did try my best to give him free time but can’t control when I’m sick. I’ve tried to just bring toddler with me but he will just open the door and run away while I’m puking.

I really don't like being there and I try to only sleep in the bed I have at his house. I never take anything I care about and I don't have the room personalized or anything.

6,1gkco7b,WIBTA if I take my boyfriend's money?,"I (f18) am a first year college student. I'm a commuter and I love about 30 minutes away from my college. I make basically first for money and can barely afford to get to my college each week and feed myself, actually I basically can't afford and it if it weren't for my boyfriend (m18) I would not be able to eat every week. Right now I don't have time for another job and I can't get more hours at my current workplace due to my busy schedule.

On the other hand my boyfriend isn't going to college and doesn't have a car, instead he has a full time job, no bills, and plays video games when hes not at work or with me. His mom and neighbor drive him to and from work every day and he makes more than 4 times what I make weekly. He works hard and is very good at his job so obviously he deserves what he makes.

Before I started college the rolls were reversed, I had job that I worked 20-30 hrs a week at and made about half of what he's making now but he had no job at all. I was mainly stuck to paying for all of our activities and still could barely afford it but we made it work.

Now that I'm in college and our dynamic has swapped he pays for relatively all of our activity expenses, and even sometimes covers my gas for the trips we make. I am beyond grateful at how much he pays for and I have no idea how to make it up to him but I'm often left feeling like I'm just a money pit for him. 

On top of all of that he insists almost daily on giving me money for the week, though I have never accepted it. He claims that the only reason he got a job in the first place was to save up for a car and spend his money on me since he couldn't when we first started dating but I feel like I cannot in good conscience take his money for my own benefit. Its not that I have an ego issue with taking other people's help but I understand the value of money in today's economy and I genuinely feel wrong for accepting his handouts. I know in reality that if he did give me money it likely wouldn't harm him financially but it still just feels wrong.

Sometimes when I think about how financially screwed I am at the moment I consider accepting his offer but there's a small part of me that just feels wrong about the whole ordeal. 

I guess I just need a fresh perspective from people on the outside of my current predicament. Would I be the asshole if I ended up accepting his offers? Is it greedy? I feel like he's already paying for enough things

His fiancé pretty much does not share anything about the details of the wedding to the family.

When the family keeps asking what the plan was and if there is anything we could do to help, she would just respond, we got it, just attend. But over the weekend my MIL kept pushing to get more details since we are not getting any respond from her, I suggested we can cancel xmas so it is one thing to worry about. My future SIL responded. “Please do not use my wedding as a reason to cancel xmas”.

I was shocked and honestly, hurt. My MIL came over the weekend and I shared my feelings. I shared that it makes me uncomfortable now going to the family events with my future SIL there and maybe will not go at all.

Apparently, this was relayed to my future SIL by my MIL. My MIL just want to make sure that everything is okay with future SIL. Future SIL messaged me and my husband with the screenshot of my MIL’s message. She said she has no idea that it was an issue. She was just being honest of what she said, and did not appreciate that we are bringing drama to her on a Monday morning. My husband responded which pretty much denied that I threatened to not come to any family events that he has no idea of where it was coming from which I think made it worse.

Because she responded that we need to figure out amongst ourselves who is lying, my MIL or my husband. She is too busy for the unnecessary drama and to remove her from our narratives (whatever that means). Then she blocked the entire family.

My BIL texted us that the December intimate ceremony is canceled and that they are getting married this Friday. Our family is flabbergasted of what just happened. My BIL told us that he is sad of what happened, and part of it was his fault.  He failed and turned blind eye on how my inlaws were treating his fiancé thinking she would get used to it like I did. My inlaws are known for indirect insults and backhanded comments. But, what transpired over the weekend (me) is an eye opening for him. He made it very clear to us that he was the one who suggested to not have us at the ceremony because it is also his fiancé’s wedding, and he wants his fiancé to be surrounded by people that love and support her at her wedding day. He also made it clear to us to not even dare to ask him to choose between his fiancé or family because we will not like the answer. If we have issues about it, then that’s our problem and that he will never talk about this anymore unless we apologize to his fiancé. But the entire family do not even know what we did, and the entire family thinks that her reaction on what happened over the weekend is a bit much.

8,1gkckxf,AITA for planning a Disney trip without my stepdaughter and leaving her with her father,"I (41F) and my husband (41M) have four children. I have one child from a previous relationship, he has two, and we have one together. 

We have always treated the children as equally as possible, though with extended family, they don't always go on the same trips if we don't go. Ex: his parents take his children on vacations and my child doesn't want to go without me. This has never been an issue. But when we plan trips, we always take everyone. 

The problem is that my SD (16 f) doesn't really like anything that anyone else does. Or she will like it until someone else does. Ex: she really wanted to go on a winter trip to Colorado for skiing. None of the other children were that excited, but seeing as it's hard to find things she likes, we went. She was excited until the other kids started enjoying it too, then she wanted to leave. This is pretty much what happens when we went on trips to the zoo, museums, anything. And if other people are already happy about it, she immediately hates the idea.

We thought maybe she just wanted time with each parent alone. So we did that with both her mom and dad. She still complained the whole time. Her counselor said maybe she wants activities with both parents to show they get along. They did that but if they show any enjoyment at all, she hates whatever they are doing. We've done girl days with her mom and I and she hates it. We have found the less enthusiastic we are, the more she wants to do it. 

This applies to meals too. If someone else likes something, she finds ways to criticize it. It's like she can't let anyone else enjoy anything. She also likes things more if no one else wants to do them. This also happens when she goes with her aunt and cousins. Her sister is not like this at all. We've asked her if she has any insight (their mother has too) and she comes up with nothing other than, ""She's just a b***h"" and shrugs. 

We let her choose other day trips, told her she can bring her friend, but it's the same. If she sees someone like something she chose, she complains and says it was her idea like no one else can enjoy it.

So this year, we had been talking about Disney for a while. My nephew has cancer and has always wanted to go with us because he has no siblings and not many friends because he's missed a lot of school. SD said it was stupid as soon as everyone else wanted to go. Her father said he would have a lot of work to catch up on when he got back. He does seasonal work and has to take the work while he can. The kids agreed that they wanted to go and he wanted us to, so I made the plans and we decided to go back another year with all of us. 

I made the reservations for myself, sister, nephew, and 3 of our children, deciding SD can stay back with dad since she didn't want to go anyway.

My husband says ITA for not planning for her to come too but I don't want her ruining the trip with complaints with my nephew there. Aita?

Edit: To clarify, I asked SD multiple times if she wanted to go as I planned, so I would know at each stage if she had changed her mind. She was adamant every time she didn't want to go. Her dad says she always says she doesn't want to go but would regret missing out. This is based on last summer's vacation when she said she didnt want to go but loved it. We were at a campground and it rained the whole time. We were pretty miserable but she thought it was funny.

The problem is that my SD (16 f) doesn't really like anything that anyone else does. Or she will like it until someone else does. Ex: she really wanted to go on a winter trip to Colorado for skiing. None of the other children were that excited, but seeing as it's hard to find things she likes, we went. She was excited until the other kids started enjoying it too, then she wanted to leave. This is pretty much what happens when we went on trips to the zoo, museums, anything. And if other people are already happy about it, she immediately hates the idea.

We thought maybe she just wanted time with each parent alone. So we did that with both her mom and dad. She still complained the whole time. Her counselor said maybe she wants activities with both parents to show they get along. They did that but if they show any enjoyment at all, she hates whatever they are doing. We've done girl days with her mom and I and she hates it. We have found the less enthusiastic we are, the more she wants to do it. 

This applies to meals too. If someone else likes something, she finds ways to criticize it. It's like she can't let anyone else enjoy anything. She also likes things more if no one else wants to do them. This also happens when she goes with her aunt and cousins. Her sister is not like this at all. We've asked her if she has any insight (their mother has too) and she comes up with nothing other than, ""She's just a b***h"" and shrugs. 

We let her choose other day trips, told her she can bring her friend, but it's the same. If she sees someone like something she chose, she complains and says it was her idea like no one else can enjoy it.

So this year, we had been talking about Disney for a while. My nephew has cancer and has always wanted to go with us because he has no siblings and not many friends because he's missed a lot of school. SD said it was stupid as soon as everyone else wanted to go. Her father said he would have a lot of work to catch up on when he got back. He does seasonal work and has to take the work while he can. The kids agreed that they wanted to go and he wanted us to, so I made the plans and we decided to go back another year with all of us. 

I made the reservations for myself, sister, nephew, and 3 of our children, deciding SD can stay back with dad since she didn't want to go anyway.

My husband says ITA for not planning for her to come too but I don't want her ruining the trip with complaints with my nephew there. Aita?

Edit: To clarify, I asked SD multiple times if she wanted to go as I planned, so I would know at each stage if she had changed her mind. She was adamant every time she didn't want to go. Her dad says she always says she doesn't want to go but would regret missing out. This is based on last summer's vacation when she said she didnt want to go but loved it. We were at a campground and it rained the whole time. We were pretty miserable but she thought it was funny. ",,1.03264057636261,1,0

10,1gkcein,AITA For Suggesting to Cancel Xmas So My Future Sister-in-Law Can Focus on Her Wedding?,"A little background my Husband and I are married for 15 years now. My husband’s family is not perfect, and there have been some occasions that they were toxic. My in-laws often would say back handed comments to me or indirectly insulted me. I do not get along with them nor I feel they even like me, which resulted of me not wanting to spend time with them more than I have to. That actions might have resulted to some family dramas over the years. However, at the end of the day we are still family.

My BIL is getting married this December. His fiancé pretty much does not share anything about the details of the wedding to the family. She canceled the ceremony and just decided to have an intimate ceremony at their church with just an immediate family and will just have a reception in December with the extended family. When the family keeps asking what the plan was and if there is anything we could do to help, she would just respond, we got it, just attend. But over the weekend my MIL kept pushing to get more details since we are not getting any respond from her, I suggested we can cancel xmas so it is one thing to worry about. My future SIL responded. “Please do not use my wedding as a reason to cancel xmas”.

I was shocked and honestly, hurt. My MIL came over the weekend and I shared my feelings. I shared that it makes me uncomfortable now going to the family events with my future SIL there and maybe will not go at all.

Apparently, this was relayed to my future SIL by my MIL. My MIL just want to make sure that everything is okay with future SIL. Future SIL messaged me and my husband with the screenshot of my MIL’s message. She said she has no idea that it was an issue. She was just being honest of what she said, and did not appreciate that we are bringing drama to her on a Monday morning. Me threatening not to come to a family function is just getting old that if I don’t want to come, be honest about it and not use her as the reason. She further this drama is exhausting, and she simply do not have time for it. My husband responded which pretty much denied that I threatened to not come to any family events that he has no idea of where it was coming from, and we should have a drink sometime later to talk about it. Which I think made it worse.

She responded that we need to figure out amongst ourselves who is lying, my MIL or my husband. She is too busy for the unnecessary drama and to remove her from our narratives (whatever that means). Then she blocked the entire family and canceled the reception.

My BIL texted us that the December intimate ceremony is also canceled and that they are getting married this Friday. Our family is flabbergasted of what just happened. My BIL told us that he is sad of what happened, and part of it was his fault.  He failed and turned blind eye on how my inlaws were treating his fiancé thinking she would get used to it like I did. What transpired over the weekend (me) is an eye opening for him. He made it very clear to us that he was the one who suggested to not have us at the ceremony because it is also his fiancé’s wedding, and he wants his fiancé to be surrounded by people that love and support her at her wedding day. He also made it clear to us to not even dare to ask him to choose between his fiancé or family because we will not like the answer. If we have issues about it, then that’s our problem and that he will never talk about this anymore unless we apologize to his fiancé. But the entire family do not even know what we did, and the entire family thinks that her reaction on what happened over the weekend is a bit much.

11,1gkby4w,AITA for refusing to give my sister any help in anything ever?,"I (16f) have one sister (15). She has a temper and it makes her mean. When we were younger it was over stuff that she believed I could do that she couldn't. But there was nothing. She'd say I got to do more extra curricular's than her but we each had one. I was in a music class after school for 5 years and she did dance. My classes had more breaks than hers did but we still only had one each. She'd get SO mad at me for having more and sometimes when I'd get back from class when she was on break I'd come home to her dumping all my stuff all over the room. One time she threw stuff from the top of the stairs when dad and I were coming in the door and she broke a lot of toys.

I was jealous that mom and dad bought her more stuff at Christmas when we were younger. At the time I thought they loved her more but the stuff all added up to the same amount. I got less because my individual gifts cost more. But when my sister was mean I'd argue that she got more than me. She'd still say I still got to do more stuff and it wasn't fair.

When I was 10 she broke my guitar because she still believed I did more extra curricular's. My parents couldn't afford to replace it back then and I decided to quit music lessons because I didn't like other instruments as much, except piano but that was more expensive to learn and we never owned a piano so practice was impossible. I hated her so much for it but she would act so smug about it. She rubbed it in my face for years. When I got angry enough I'd tell her I wish she wasn't my sister and I hated her. She'd say same.

I started my period when I was 11 and I have endometriosis, only diagnosed this year, which causes me issues. I bleed a lot and have so much pain. My sister started calling me gross and would tell people at school about how gross I am and she'd tell people about bleeding accidents I had. This is an ongoing problem and our parents punish her for it and they try to make us talk our issues out but it's a waste of time. They discipline me too if I express that I hate her. I try not to say it but it's not a lie when I say it. I do hate her. And I'm not ashamed of hating the person who tries to make home and school hell for me.

There are times my sister has needed help and I ignored it and did nothing. Which came up a couple of days ago because my parents wanted me to tutor my sister in math. She always struggled with Math but now she's failing it and they want me to help her so she doesn't end up failing math all the way through high school. But I refused. I told them I would take them punishing me over helping her. My parents brought up how I never help my sister and how she might bully me sometimes but we're sisters and we should love each other and as the older sister I should try to help when I can. I told them I'd take being punished. They told me I was being so stubborn and they've been mad the last couple of days.

I wanted to make a DnD campaign for my closest friends and had finished all my preparations. We set a date for the first session; everyone was pretty hyped up, and I was excited as well. The day we were supposed to start, a friend—let’s call her Lisa (girlfriend of one of my closer friends, let’s call him Fabien)—asked if it would be cool to livestream the session on Twitch. Some of us were reluctant, wanting to “groove in” with each other for the first session without an audience, myself included.

She argued that her viewers would miss the lore if we skipped streaming the first session and that the story wouldn’t make sense without it (for context, her Twitch channel has at most 10 viewers). After some back and forth, she said, “Either we stream the first session, or we don’t.” I replied, “Then we don’t.”

Once the group gathered on Discord, everyone was excited but noticed that Fabien and Lisa were delaying. After 20 minutes, Fabien joined, clearly upset, saying we’d hurt Lisa’s feelings. Apparently, she was sobbing and couldn’t speak, so he spoke on her behalf. He launched into a tirade, especially targeting me for “talking down” to her so harshly.

A female friend of mine, who was pregnant at the time, and another female friend defended me, going through our chat history and pointing out that none of us had said anything problematic. Fabien countered that our tone was “harsh,” while we felt Lisa was reading too much into our texts.

Fabien and Lisa decided not to join, so we played the first session without them, though the group was a bit tense. Afterward, the discussion reignited in chat rooms and private messages. The two girls and I discussed how to proceed, as Fabien and Lisa wanted nothing to do with them after “how harshly, dismissively, and angrily” they felt we’d spoken.

I tried to mediate, but eventually, I wanted to get it over with and encouraged both sides to speak directly to each other. This only escalated things, especially when a comment was made about the pregnant friend’s baby that went way too far.

15,1gkbmkz,AITA for Not Ordering My BF Food of His Choice?,"I (F21) have been going out with my BF (M21) for 2 months now. He’s in engineering and i’m in business. he had a paid internship this summer that paid him thousands of dollars each month. meanwhile my internship was free. I’ve come to notice that after he pays for one dinner or a meal, he conveniently “leaves his wallet” and has “0 battery” when we have to eat out/order restaurant food the next time and i have to pay for it.

I have 0 problem paying for food after he has paid for the previous meal but he doesn’t even let me offer and imposes a sort of avoidable situation at me as to why he can’t pay for the particular meal and i have to pay for it. 

i thought i was overthinking but yesterday, on our 2 month mark, he was liek i wanna have a gourmet burger, not wendy’s, i thought he was going to pay for the food delivery, but then this voice inside me said “worst case scenario, i have to pay for our 2 month dinner”, which was fine with me because i was going to offer anyways but i just thought that yk usually it’s the guy who pays for big meals. anyways, he conveniently told me “im at 1% battery rn”, 3 hours before we ordered food online. when he told me that, i could see whatever he told me 3 hours later coming from a mile away. i told him to charge his phone asap because he was at home and his charger was right next to us. i offered to even give him his charger, he said no. instead, he proceeded to play a game on his phone, causing it to die.

He’s in engineering and i’m in business. he had a paid internship this summer that paid him thousands of dollars each month. meanwhile my internship was free. I’ve come to notice that after he pays for one dinner or a meal, he conveniently “leaves his wallet” and has “0 battery” when we have to eat out/order restaurant food the next time and i have to pay for it.

I have 0 problem paying for food after he has paid for the previous meal but he doesn’t even let me offer and imposes a sort of avoidable situation at me as to why he can’t pay for the particular meal and i have to pay for it. 

i thought i was overthinking but yesterday, on our 2 month mark, he was liek i wanna have a gourmet burger, not wendy’s, i thought he was going to pay for the food delivery, but then this voice inside me said “worst case scenario, i have to pay for our 2 month dinner”, which was fine with me because i was going to offer anyways but i just thought that yk usually it’s the guy who pays for big meals. anyways, he conveniently told me “im at 1% battery rn”, 3 hours before we ordered food online. when he told me that, i could see whatever he told me 3 hours later coming from a mile away. i told him to charge his phone asap because he was at home and his charger was right next to us. i offered to even give him his charger, he said no. instead, he proceeded to play a game on his phone, causing it to die.

We ended up sleeping together and I haven’t heard anything from her since. Until my brother told me that he was getting pretty serious with a girl and he wanted to introduce her to me. I was happy for my brother but a little hurt that he hadn’t told me he was talking to someone. 

Anyways, we went out to brunch and he introduces me to Mya. I was shocked obviously but I wasn’t going to tell my brother at a brunch with my family that I had sex with his girlfriend. (Just a note my brother and I are like carbon copies of each other. We look like twins except he’s got about 4 inches on me and his hair is  slightly shorter.

It didn’t take long for the truth to come out though because she confessed about a week after the brunch.

This didn’t go over well with a couple of friends. They feel that splitting everything equally is just “what friends do” and that it’s awkward if I go off to do my own thing for cheaper options while they stick to the pricier plans.

18,1gkbdgo,AITA For leaving my family behind to restart,"Just as the title says. My names Drizz, I'm 23 and I just left my family (mom (48) , brother (25) , sister (18)) to basically fend for themselves as I want to restart and do new due to too much conflicting points internally and within the family. 

So In 2022 I decided move to MN from where we were in FL. When I did that, I left my brother, sister, and mom alone and they were ok when I left. Perfectly fine financially and mentally. I decide to visit them in  early 2023 and when I get to them, the house is in shambles from a mental standpoint. 

They were at the point of getting evicted, no one had a job, etc. When I seen this I decided to stay and try and rebuild the family up cause yk... family. 

When I decided to do this, my older brother wasn't living with my mom nor sister. He has a fiance and 2 kids with her, so he went and moved in with her. Seeing that, I got a 2 bedroom apartment. One room for me, a bedroom for my mom and sister as its the most I could afford and the quickest thing I found

We move in October 2023 and from that point all the way until Nov 1st 2024 I pay the rent and most heavy bills. All the family has to worry about is the phone, car insurance, and groceries which comes down to less than 600$ a month while im stuck paying 2400$+ a month in bills.

I generally didn't care about this because it felt good to help the family, but a month or two after moving in , I start hearing my family say I should do more and become more of a man to help more. At first, I shrug it off because I'm a pretty stone made heart dude and don't get fazed by others easily. 

As the months move on and we enter July 2024, I'm all excited for My birthday which was July 10th. Not a single cake, not a gift (not that I care for one but yk a pair socks could of showed me they cared), nothing. Instead I'm told my GF took me out for dinner too long and they don't have time to wait for me, which wouldn't make sense as they didn't even buy me a cake/cupcake/whatever

Thats when I mentally started taking a bad route realizing that my family was just using me it felt like and no matter what I did it wasnt enough. My brother then moves in with us in August 2024 and he is complete hell. He argues that I bring too many different girls to the house (All friends + I pay the rent while he never even have a dollar up for a water bottle) , that I'm disrespectful, lazy, etc.

Want to know what the family did to deal with my brother? Nothing, they told me he had a point and that I should listen to him. A man with no job, no degree, 3 kids, no home. 

So from August 2024 till Nov 2024 my mental really got crushed and I could feel myself beating itself up. I started doubting my looks, my choicez, just everything. 

So, Nov 1st 2024 came around, bought a last min plane ticket to NY, left behind my Computer, 2 laptops, all my consoles, 95% of my shoes (rip to my all my jordan 4's) , No money , no nothing cause I really couldn't stand being there a second longer

Now my phone is being blown up by my immediate family and extended family on how bad of a person I am and just the most wildest messages. So my question is, AITA for leaving them and everything behind?

20,1gkadq3,AITA for setting a deadline for completing a job,"My son (20M) decided to do a major cleaning of his room.  This involved moving everything but furniture out of the room.

He started last Monday, asked if he could unload his room into the living room, which was OK.  I assumed this would take 1-2 days, he doesn't work or go to school.  By Wednesday, he was still unloading rather than taking things back up.  He said he'd be done by Halloween.

He wasn't done by then, assured us he'd be finished by the time we returned from a weekend trip.  We returned Sunday evening, very little progress, at this point I was getting frustrated as our living room was still filled.  I didn't express this to him, rather to my wife.  She assured me he was making progress, almost done cleaning, was slowly starting to take things back up.

Got home from work last evening, only a few things were moved (~ 1/4 of it).  His room is not large (the house is only 1,200 sq. ft.).  I wasn't happy, took the dog on a walk and texted my wife that I was setting a deadline of today, 11/5.  When I returned, he was eating and talking to friends on the phone.  I got his attention, he muted the call and I told him I expected the living room to be cleared out by Tuesday.  I acknowledged he was doing a big job, but it had been a week and was time to get finished.  I didn't yell, raise my voice, use bad language.  I was as reasonable in tone as possible.

He said ""OK, I'll get it done"" and went upstairs.  My wife got home noticeably unhappy.  Said she would have preferred to speak to him first as it's overwhelming for him.

This morning she came up from downstairs visibly upset.  My son spent the night after we went to bed carting everything  to his room and dumping it wherever there was space.  He told her he now feels uncomfortable living there and wants to get out as soon as possible, she is upset that I ""rushed him"".  I said that I felt a couple days was all that was needed, he's home all day; a week should have been more than enough time.

Possible contributing issues:

1.  My wife and son moved in about 3 1/2 years ago; she had previously lived with him alone (her ex-husband kicked her out when my son was less than a year old).
2.  He had a significant illness that left him with minor brain damage when he was 13.  He has significant social anxiety, this made the transition to adulthood difficult.  He graduated high school online after significant bullying in high school, was an honor student, but has the social anxiety and a (as his mother describes it) ""fear of the world"".
3.  Part of that fear is his gender; he's transgender (FtM), we live in a very ""red state"" in the Southern US.  That was the source of the bullying in high school, also why he's not on speaking terms with his biological father.  I'm his stepfather, though he's considered me his father since I married his mother.  He also overheard his biological father hatefully reject him due to his being transgender.

we were adjusting some equipment Z was watching thru a microscope. Out of nowhere she snapped at us saying “Gosh get up & do the work. Just do it yourselves if you know so much C’mon, get up & do it!” We were completely taken aback I responded by “Fine I’ll do it” thinking it would diffuse the tension.
Afterward I tried to brush it off & talked to her normally. She then apologized saying she didn’t mean to snap/was just annoyed cuz she felt she wasn’t contributing enough I told her I understood/it’s okay we’re friends but requested not snap at me again & tell us instead so we can work things. as I really dislike when ppl get aggressive
Instead of accepting my request Z got even angrier claiming I was mad at her. She left & walked away even tho I called after her & walked over telling her we’re friends we shouldn’t act like that then she said she didn’t want to work with me anymore. I was confused since I had only meant to communicate how I felt
*btw She even talked to me about X when we were alone saying she didn’t like how she took things out of her hand while she was trying to work. I told her yea but talk to her why did u snap at me, she got even angrier when I told her not to do it again. She even mentioned u don’t know me I got anger issues. I told her u don’t know me as well & I hate when ppl be aggressive when I didn’t do anything wrong.
next day I found out from X that Z had been talking about the incident behind my back making me look like the bad person. Z even mentioned she didn’t want to work with me which left me feeling hurt/bewildered
I tried to say hi to Z later, she brushed me off saying she needed to leave. I’ve also been told by X that Z expressed frustration over my remarks for wanting to finish our work early instead of taking vids during our experiments. I never meant to offend her I just have time constraints bcuz my brother waits for me after we finish & i was late
I feel like I haven’t done anything wrong & have been respectful thruout our friendship. I’m tired of this drama especially when I genuinely want to be friends with Z. I even considered buying her coffee as a peace offering but I’m unsure if I should even bother since she’s the one snapped first then made everythin into big deal
My other friends said I try again & apologize to Z, but I feel I’ve already done my part by expressing how her behavior upset me. I’m starting to think that stepping back might be best option since I’ve tried to resolve this. Cuz yk I don’t wanna disrespect myself. idk man
am I bad here for standing up for myself or did I handle it wrong?

She left & walked away even tho I called after her & walked over telling her we’re friends we shouldn’t act like that then she said she didn’t want to work with me anymore. I was confused since I had only meant to communicate how I felt
*btw She even talked to me about X when we were alone saying she didn’t like how she took things out of her hand while she was trying to work. I told her yea but talk to her why did u snap at me, she got even angrier when I told her not to do it again. She even mentioned u don’t know me I got anger issues. I told her u don’t know me as well & I hate when ppl be aggressive when I didn’t do anything wrong.
next day I found out from X that Z had been talking about the incident behind my back making me look like the bad person. Z even mentioned she didn’t want to work with me which left me feeling hurt/bewildered
I tried to say hi to Z later, she brushed me off saying she needed to leave. I’ve also been told by X that Z expressed frustration over my remarks for wanting to finish our work early instead of taking vids during our experiments. I never meant to offend her I just have time constraints bcuz my brother waits for me after we finish & i was late
I feel like I haven’t done anything wrong & have been respectful thruout our friendship. I’m tired of this drama especially when I genuinely want to be friends with Z. I even considered buying her coffee as a peace offering but I’m unsure if I should even bother since she’s the one snapped first then made everythin into big deal
My other friends said I try again & apologize to Z, but I feel I’ve already done my part by expressing how her behavior upset me. I’m starting to think that stepping back might be best option since I’ve tried to resolve this. Cuz yk I don’t wanna disrespect myself. idk man
am I bad here for standing up for myself or did I handle it wrong?
i got other friends that I be spending time with but yk I hate when I have problems with ppl I just want peace yk. idk what to do anymore. what is the right thing to do

23,1gk9agk,AITA for questioning my friend her budgeting? ,"My friend (39F) got divorced 4 years ago. Her and her ex-husband did not accumulate any wealth. They always rented and barely saved.

24,1gk8p3d,AITA for not inviting all my friend group to friendsgiving this year?,"So I (27F) am from a european country but I've always loved the idea of friendsgiving and that's why I've been hosting one every year the last Saturday of November for the last 5 years. I used to do it at my ex bf's house (lest call him Dave) because it's more spacious than my appartment. 

Beginign of last year (2023) me and Dave broke up and a couple months latter he started dating another girl in our friend group (lets call her Sarah). Fast foward to october 24th 2023 (a day before I'm supposed to sent my invites. For context, I always send digital invites exctly a month in avance just to make sure everyone saves the date) we all recieve a messages for a friendsgiving dinner at Dave and Sarah's on the last Saturday of November. I called him to ask if it was a joke, and he replied to me that he wanted to continue hosting friendsgiving. Mind you the idea was always mine and I was the one doing all the work every year, so it never occured to me that he would want to make it. I asked him if he could do his dinner another weekend since friendsgiving was kind of my thing, not only that, but also on that specific date. He told me no, and try to gaslight me into thinking that we always had work on it 50/50 so it was as much a thing of mine as it was his. I spoke with my sister and decided to send my invites the next day and continue with everything as planned. This caused a bit of tension in my friend group, I never wanted to start any trouble so I just comented my point of view on the matter with those who asked me. Some of my friends sided with me and ended up coming to my dinner, but others said that I was beging childish about it and that I should let Dave and Sarah made that years dinner. Because of that  some of my friends ended up dropping and I invited some of my sister's friends that I've also known for a long time, and it turned out being the best friendsgiving I've ever hosted.

Fastfoward to october 28th of this year Dave and Shara have send a messages saying they are doing a friendsgiving dinner at their house on, you guessed it, the last Saturday of November. I've replay saying I already made plans and on the 29th I sent my invites, this time only to the people that came last year to my dinner. So this last couple of days I've been recieving messages from the rest of the friend group that I haven't invited asking why they havent recieve one. I've explain to them that my appartment doesnt have space to host more people that the ones I did last year (which is true) and since they preferred to go to Dave and Shara's last year I assumed this year would be the same. Also I would love to have only last year's people since 1. they where the ones who show me me that are true friends of mine (which is kind of the point of friendsgiving) and 2. it was one of those rare ocassions where you introduce two different groups of people and everyone clicks instantly.

So AITA for not inviting everyone?



P.S. Sorry if there are any grammatical or vocabulary mistakes, English is not my first language.

Edit: Me and Dave have very difference styles when it comes to hosting. I like to be a bit over the top and have everything ready for when people arrive whereas he is more of the type of person that will let us gather at his house but everyone has to contribute and help.

It was fine until maybe a month later she said that we had to start leaving the house at 5am in the morning and can only return at 11pm at night. The reason she gave us for this was that her neighbor was nosey and she believed that her neighbor was in contact with her landlord telling on her. By the way we later found out this idea was actually the cousin’s doing. We went along with this arrangement for months. We were soo tired every day and we did most of our sleeping in the car since we weren’t getting adequate rest and the cops were even called on us twice for falling asleep in a parking lot because people thought we were passed out in the car from drugs. We spent a lot of days just sitting at the park crying do to this but we believed the aunt since she said she was putting herself at risk helping us. Also the amount of rent we had to pay never changed even though we were not allowed in the house most of the day. So then everything went downhill because one morning I saw something I wasn’t supposed to see.

Later that night i got up to use the restroom and infront of the trail to the restroom was my uncle and like 5 other men. My uncle starts telling me “oh no dont fall” and things like “walk straight” and “can you walk” while laughing with these other men. Now keep in mind i was walking perfectly fine. So i tell him “why do you keep making those jokes, do you have something to say? Cus if you do u can say it to me infront of my dad.” So i went up to my dad and explained his brother (my uncle) kept fucking with me.

I've told her multiple times I had no intention of booking this year and didn't want to cheap out on a potentially once in a lifetime trip, but she wants to book early and stay in capsule hotels and hostels so she can definitely afford to go. I know she's trying to help and feel like might be being a bit selfish but also think I've been transparent, AITA?",0.0,0.0468350574374198,0,1

33,1gk3x39,AITA for moving out after college instead of staying to help sick father,"Some background info, throughout college I was working in order pay for my school, my last year of college I met my significant other. Around this same time my father started his health decline. Throughout this period both my familial and partner relationships were very rough as I was trying to balance being a partner, being a daughter, working, and going to school. Admittedly I fell short in all of these areas except maybe working as I was able to afford school. But it left a sore spot in the hearts of my family as I “checked out” when my dad got sick.

I just graduated college and plan on moving in with my significant other. I brought it up with my parents since I was already feeling uneasy as I’ve never felt like moving away until I met my partner. Additionally I already felt bad for having this desire even without the addition of my dad being sick but that just made it more gut wrenching. 

They have never really liked my partner since that initial rough patch but we made it work as much as it needed to whenever we had gatherings. So when I brought wanting to move in with him, they were taken aback. Mentioning how I have awful judgment, I am an awful daughter, the list goes on. I have now been essentially cut off right before the holidays. The sort of verbal attacks I received as backlash put me on the defensive even though I know there is still some fault I need to take for not helping all I could have, or wanting to move out during these times.

35,1gk3r4i,AITA for giving my aunt a piece of my mind?,"
I, 22M, was talking to my aunt on the phone. She badmouthed my friend, essentially calling him a shitty, untrustworthy person and saying that she thinks he wants to rap3 me. Why? Because he told me that two of the people that we used to work with at Wendy’s were saying horrible things about me behind my back. They called me the r-word and one said to the other, “We should intentionally bully Taylor into quitting.” The other one’s face lit up when she said that. She was like, “Why would he say something knowing it would hurt your feelings? How shitty! He knew that you working there was going to be a past chapter in your life. What positives came out of that?” 
The problem? She told me that my late mom had a drug addiction with very specific details to follow, including asking around the family for pain medicine and, when they stopped giving it to her, money to buy it. My grandmother was the first person to say something about this, and she was having early onset dementia, so I thought I’d ask my aunt for clarification, and that’s when she said all of that and more. I find that hypocritical of her.

I told her that. “My mom’s been dead for ten years, so you knew that was a past chapter of my life. Why would you talk to me about this knowing it would hurt my feelings? What positives came out of you telling me that my mom had a drug addiction?” I also told her that one positive that I can think of that came out of my friend telling me that is that he helped me to realize who my real friends were and who my fake friends were, who really liked me and who didn’t. As someone with autism, I think that’s important.

I know I might’ve come across as defensive, but I kinda felt like I had to. This is my friend she was trash-talking, friends stick up for each other. Besides, rap3 accusations are very heavy things to throw on someone and their character, and I don’t think she realizes that.

My boyfriend will be joining me in one or two months. 
I haven't really made any friends yet but a few days ago met a girl from a Facebook meet up group and we got on very well. We also met another time after that. She's leaving soon and is going to Singapore before going home, and she invited me to join her for a few days. 

My boyfriend worked in Singapore for 3 years. Initially when I asked him what he thinks about me going, he said go for it… But now he seems upset that I am going without him.
First he seemed concerned that I'll be meeting my new friend when l've only known her for a few days, which is fair. I told him we would not be staying at the same accommodation, so if I ever felt unsafe of that anything was off, l'd leave (not that I think this would happen)

But now he said he wanted to go to Singapore with me so he could show me around since he’s spent so much time there. I told him we can still go together and he can show me around the other places. I would only go for 4 days so it's not like I'll be seeing everything. He said it's expensive and why would I want to go somewhere l've already been...

37,1gk37vt,AITAH for telling my boyfriend he needs hobbies ,"Note this is a throwaway account and I have asked my friends about this but I need a unbiased opinion
I 18F am dating a 18M we have been together for almost a year now. I met him through some mutual friends who I don't talk to anymore. When I first met him I got the impression that he was some mysterious shy nerd. I was very wrong he is shy but not at all a nerd I didn't mind this at all as he was very funny and kind to me. We got together after just a short time of knowing each other. I was so excited to get to know him and all his interests and quirks however that was it. He had none, no hobbies, no sports he liked, no art nothing. He enjoyed nothing. I thought maybe he was just being shy but after knowing him for a year he still hasn't told me anything he enjoys. One night I decided to ask him directly why/ how he had no hobbies. He just said that nothing gave him joy in life other than me, while this was sweet it is also terrifying. I shouldn't be his only source of joy, what if we get in a fight and I hurt his feelings. I don't even want to imagine what he would do if we broke up. So I decided to tell him to get a hobbie I even suggested a few that we could try together. He said their was no point in trying as he would hate it. I'm worried about him, I can't bare the whole of his emotions its to much on top of what I'm dealing with. I get it we are both young and figuring things out, but this can't be normal right? He got quite mad at my suggestion and said I was calling him boring and saying that his life had no purpose. I would like to add that I am very busy with lots of hobbies and work and barely get to see him. When I'm not seeing him all he does is sit on his computer watching YouTube. Am I the asshole? 

Edit: after reading all the comments I am so grateful to have posted. You where right. I spoke to him and unprovoked he told me that he had been struggling with mental health and it had gotten worse recently. What I thought was him withdrawing from me and his friends was actually him struggling. He said that he had decided to go to a doctor to get diagnosed with anxiety officially and maybe get on some meds for it. I can't believe I missed the signs earlier on in our relationship. we had discussed our past struggles with depression and how we had got through it. His experience was much more recant than mine. After more talking he agreed that finding little joy in his life was not normal and he agreed to see some one about it. Reading everyone's comments made things a lot clearer to me, he is unable to find stuff he enjoys because he is struggling with mental health. I feel shit for missing this, I always knew that he had bad anxiety and encouraged him to seak therapy but didn't realise how bad it actually was. I so happy that he has come to the conclusion of needing therapy himself as it save me a really difficult conversation. I told him that i wanted to help and support him in anyway I could that if he needed something to tell me. Things are looking really good.

38,1gk2uib,WIBTA if i charge for a coverup of a nasty tattoo i did?,"
i'm one year into tattooing, this is the first coverup i do of a tattoo that i did. i tattooed a saying in arabic on a girl's back a few weeks ago and we both tought it translated to ""appreciate life"" because the translation was right under the words in arabic in the photo she sent me. she texted me a few days ago saying that she wants me to delete the pic of her tattoo off of my page because it actually translates to something awful.

i was so shocked, i ran the pic thru translate lens myself like 5 times and the tattoo did, in fact, mean something gross. i usually do check what clients' tattoos mean beforehand when they are in a foreign language, but i did not check this one because the translation came with the refference pic. i quickly deleted the post and told her that i'm happy to work on a coverup together if she's down for it. she was, and i finished the design today. she likes it and we are gonna do it

the thing is, i feel very guilty about this whole thing bc it never happened to me before. i feel really sorry that i put that on someone's body and i am very happy to cover it, but i feel SO ashamed of charging her for this coverup because i somehow feel like it's my fault. i, as the artist, should of checked the translation and i'm afraid that there is a possibility that she tought the coverup was free, so when i tell her a price she will blame me for the tattoo and end up on bad terms. it was her first tattoo and we have a common friend so she may think that i offered my coverup services as an apology, but tbh i don't even know if i did anything wrong??? maybe i'm overthinking.

i'm so conflicted and idk what to do. on one side i do feel for her and i want to help her, but on the other side this is a complex tattoo that i don't really afford to give out for free. if she was my friend i would totally do it for free but she's a friend's girlfriend's friend, so i don't even know what our status is to be able to give out my resources like that. WIBTA if i charge her for this coverup? IF i do, i will cut it down a lot tho


EDIT: to be more specific:
- i did not make the writing design myself, i just copied the picture she sent me
- the picture she sent me had the design and ""appreciate life"" under it as translation
- i'm calling the tattoo nasty bc it is. it actually translates to ""i'm rotten""
- after further research i found that the pic she sent me circulated on tumblr a few years ago as a meme but we obviously were not aware of that. it's just words on white backround

EDIT 2: i've never had so many ppl comment on my post. i've tried to read everything and i finally made my decision. thank you all for the help, truly! i will update on sunday, when the coverup is scheduled, hopefully being able to answer some questions after meeting with my client again. see you on sunday!",No A-holes here,2024-11-05,"WIBTA if i charge for a coverup of a nasty tattoo i did?

- i did not make the writing design myself, i just copied the picture she sent me
- the picture she sent me had the design and ""appreciate life"" under it as translation
- i'm calling the tattoo nasty bc it is. it actually translates to ""i'm rotten""
- after further research i found that the pic she sent me circulated on tumblr a few years ago as a meme but we obviously were not aware of that. it's just words on white backround

EDIT 2: i've never had so many ppl comment on my post. i've tried to read everything and i finally made my decision. thank you all for the help, truly! i will update on sunday, when the coverup is scheduled, hopefully being able to answer some questions after meeting with my client again. see you on sunday!",4.0,0.1016593277454376,0,0
39,1gk2e7k,WIBTA if I tell my friend that she needs to be less clingy and learn to be more independent?,"I am 16M, and my two best friends are my twin sister, who is 16F (who I'll call Katie), and our 16F friend (who I'll call Montannah).

Don't get me wrong, Montannah's a sweetheart, but she's just getting incredibly clingy towards me and Katie, and I'm worried about her.

What's playing on my mind is a party we're going to this weekend. It's one of our friends' eighteenth birthday party and Katie and I have both been looking forward to it for weeks. Most of our friends are attending, and we haven't seen a few of them in a while because they attend different schools. We were both looking forward to a night of fun and partying with them all. However, the host of the party messaged Katie last night asking if we were planning to bring Montannah, to which she replied no. So he went and invited her, and now she's coming to the party.

Normally, I'd be more than okay with this, except for the fact that Montannah will only know a few people at the party, and she isn't good with large groups of people. She said she was not enthused about there being a lot of people there, so Katie kindly asked her how she planned to cope with that. Montannah responded that she could just stick with us two. I was already planning to hang out with my other friends since I spend much less time with them than I do with her. I also have very different friendship dynamics with them. I'm  just worried that she's going to cling to either Katie or me the entire time due to her being socially awkward; which she already does regularly. I know if she does do that, I'm well in my right to ask her to give me some space while I'm with my other friends. But at the same time, I'm also afraid of her feeling like I'm abandoning her and getting upset, which has happened before.

An example of this is last year's New Year's Eve celebrations. Katie and I were planning to hang out with Montannah, just the three of us, but she cancelled a few days before. So, Katie and I went and made plans with other people. Then Montannah was suddenly able to come along at the last minute, so she came along with us and the group we'd made plans with. When the group wanted to hang out at one of our friends' houses, she stayed behind because she was getting overwhelmed with the whole situation. Montannah then got quite upset that we weren't spending time with her, which I understand; I get that she wants to spend time with the two of us. But I also wish she was able to accept that she is not the only person that we spend time with and that we won't drop plans with other friends just for her.

I just really want her to be happy, but I also want a social life with other people, which makes me wonderful if I would be the asshole if I expressed how I feel to her.

So, would I be the asshole if I were to tell her that she needs to learn to be less clingy and more independent?

I'm also really sorry if my English is not the best.

Edit: I'm planning on talking to Montannah and making it clear that I have other friends I also want to spend time with. I've decided at the party I'm going to introduce Montannah to my friends so hopefully she can get to know some of them. I've also worked out that if she starts to get clingy I'll try to talk to her kindly about how I need some space and kindly encourage she makes the effort to talk to and get to know others than just Katie and I.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-05,"WIBTA if I tell my friend that she needs to be less clingy and learn to be more independent?

40,1gk1ypf,AITA for moving forward with putting my parents out? ,"

I 35M and my wife 30F and our two children have been living in my parents home (70F &71M) for the past two years. I have paid my mother $400/month including the fact that I help with groceries, do their laundry and sometimes drive them free of charge although they never offer gas to places they need to go. It has been this way since we moved in. They have never helped with anything with my children while we struggled although they are financially well off and asking me to pay rent at all seeing that I have two children to provide for, was selfish on their part.

The past several months, my parents mainly my mother has asked that we all move out without giving us proper notice or help for a deposit since we don't have the best credit and pretty much intended to throw us on the streets. I asked her to give me until at least April of next year and I would for sure figure something out, even if we had to go to settle for a 1 bed. My mother refused, giving us until the end of this month to move out.
She has gone in my room without my permission, taken items that have been gifted to me by my brother (such as Gucci, Neiman Marcus, very expensive things) and taken it from me. At this point I filed a RO against them both which was approved saying that they can't come into my room or they'll be in violation. She has denied taking my things but I know she did.


The police have filed warrants for them both for grand larceny since I filed reports about my stolen items that exceed $900. Once they execute the warrant, I plan to get my RO modified so they can't come into the home at all anymore. Being that my children and I all feel unsafe and she took from us. AITA?

41,1gk1ch4,AITA for refusing to spend Christmas with my family?,"
I (18F) live alone with my 6 month old son. Christmas is always planned early within my family as there is a lot to plan for with a big family, so despite it only being November, we have already began making plans.

For context, when I was 16 I was living with my friend and was told I could not come to my mothers for Christmas as there was not enough space and travel would be hard (although I’m a 10 minute drive away), I was understanding and spent the Holliday with my friend and his mother. The next year, I was finally living in my own house and despite being pregnant with my son, I was greeted with the same excuse, so yet again I spent Christmas with my friend and his mother.

This year, my mum wants me and my son to spend Christmas with her and the rest of the family as it’s his first holiday and she wants to spend the day with him. Normally I’d agree but this year I firmly told her I would rather spent Christmas just myself and my baby. She got upset with me and said he should spend his first Christmas with his family. But I can’t help but not want to, the last two years I’ve felt completely disregarded and unwanted by my family around the holiday and was never invited to spend the day with them, but now that I have a son transport/space suddenly isn’t an issue. It just makes me feel like they only want me around to see my son/if it benefits them. Despite her pleading, my answer has yet to change and my family are telling me I’m an asshole for being petty and isolating my son on the holiday.

I just don’t want to go after the way I was forced to feel for two years. He’s a baby and although I’ll make the day special, he won’t remember it so I really don’t see how it’s going to harm him. My mother and I were never close but she’s been all over me since the birth of my son, constantly wanting to see him and ignoring me, invaliding me and not even checking up on me when she knows I’m struggling with postnatal depression, I can’t help but feel like I’m only loved because I had a baby and I just don’t want to spend the entire day questioning if I’m there because I’m wanted or if it’s just because I’m a mother now.

I have my own opinions but I always keep my mouth shut. I just avoid my family for the most part. My brother (20) still lives at home and well… ever since he was a kid he’s always been more out there. 

He’s very open minded and artistic as well, so he’s always pissing off our parents and sisters. He was a really good volleyball player in high school but quit his senior year just to spite our parents so I’m sure you can tell what kind of guy he is. But he’s the only boy so our parents keep “letting it go.” 

Anyways, he recently acted in some silly amateur film for one of his friends. In it, he kisses a boy. I genuinely don’t care. Anyways the film wasn’t a secret and posted publicly, so someone we know came across it and it was sent to our parents who kicked him out. 

My younger sister and her husband offered to take him in but my brother left not even a week later because our BIL was being a dick to him about the film. Now no one knows where he is and everyone’s pissed and angry. I only know he’s alive because he’s texted me a few times.

46,1gk0dr8,AITA for Not Returning My Mom’s Golden Bracelet?,"(Throwaway account for privacy reasons, with some details changed.)

I (35M) need an outside perspective because this situation is causing me a lot of stress.

For context, I’m the eldest of three siblings – my sister (33F) and my brother (31M).

Five years ago, when I got married, my father gifted my wife and me a pair of gold bracelets that had belonged to my late mother. These bracelets were passed down from my mother’s grandmother, making them deeply sentimental. My mom passed away when I was young, so it felt like a part of her was present at our wedding.

In Chinese culture, it’s traditional to gift gold jewellery to the bride during the tea ceremony at weddings. My wife and I were very touched by this gesture from my father.

Fast forward to the present: my brother is getting married soon, and my father (71M) is now demanding that I return the bracelets. He says he doesn't want to buy new ones and claims he never intended for us to keep them permanently.

I refused, explaining that he never mentioned the bracelets were on loan. If he wanted them back, why gift them to us in the first place? [A red envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope) would have sufficed.

I would understand if my dad said these bracelets were meant to be inherited by my siblings and me, but the only reason he gave is that he doesn’t want to buy new gold jewellery.  
    
I believe this conversation should have happened before gifting the bracelets to my wife and me.

My father is upset with my response and has decided to drag my siblings into this.

He even told my brother that it’s my fault his fiancée won’t be receiving any gold bracelets. When I spoke to my brother, he said he didn’t want to get between me and our dad and that he doesn't really care about the gifts. I feel like he's only saying this to avoid any arguments between him and I.

However, my sister is siding with my father. She privately messaged me, accusing me of valuing money over family. She said, “You can’t consider it a gift if Dad is asking for it back,” and told me to seriously rethink my values. She even compared me to a cousin who had stolen money from the family and ran away.

A part of me wants to return the bracelets just to keep the peace, especially with my siblings. I’m so tired of the stress, the mind games, and the fighting. But a larger part of me is enraged by all of this and doesn’t want to give in at all.

I feel like he's only saying this to avoid any arguments between him and I.

However, my sister is siding with my father. She privately messaged me, accusing me of valuing money over family. She said, “You can’t consider it a gift if Dad is asking for it back,” and told me to seriously rethink my values. She even compared me to a cousin who had stolen money from the family and ran away.

A part of me wants to return the bracelets just to keep the peace, especially with my siblings. I’m so tired of the stress, the mind games, and the fighting. But a larger part of me is enraged by all of this and doesn’t want to give in at all.

AITA for not returning the bracelets?

47,1gk0dme,AITA for taking advantage of a confusion an a board game to win?,"Me and my gf love board games. Yesterday we were playing Risk with her brother and 2 of her in-laws, on this game you receive a mission at the beginning of the game and win when you accomplish it, my gf got confused on her missions and thought that hers was to eliminate the blue player but actually it was my mission, the confusion was that in her mission card was written eliminate the Indigo player, the pieces that the game refers to are really dark and looks like black, my gf didn't knew which color was indigo and thought it was blue, halfway through the game I realized the confusion but didn't say anything thinking it was a good strategy to let her continue fighting the blue player instead of me because she was actually playing very well, she complete the mission and eliminate the blue player but as soon as she did this I revealed that eliminate the blue player was infact my mission and not hers.
She got really mad about it and told me I made her look stupid for not telling her about the mistake and took advantage of her for doing that, in my mind I was just playing the game I thought it was a funny mistake I didn't though it was a big deal, I would have done the same if it was someone else that was making the mistake and not just her, but she felt I did it to make her look stupid and if it had been someone else I would have pointed the mistake to help them win. She have mentioned that often I favor others on the games to win but no her, this is because I'm usually the one who leads on the games, I read and explain the rules to the others, I always try to be impartial and not favor anyone, I usually try to help everyone the same and when we are playing new games or they are not familiar with the rules I let pass or ignore some mistakes, but my gf insist that not with her, that I always point her mistakes and I'm tougher with her.
I'm not a competitive person and in general she isn't ether I don't care if I lose or win a game I just play because it's fun to play doesn't matter the outcome, I  didn't though she would feel bad about it. AITA for doing this?

48,1gjzmmh,AITAH for not accepting my sisters new partner even though?,"Recently my dad passed away. My sister brought her new partner of two months (who none of us had met) to the house to say goodbye to my dad in his last days. Her partner ( would not leave her side or give any of us time alone with her to grieve or talk. For perspective- I didnt even bring my husband of four year with whom I share two kids to say goodbye to my dad because we all wanted it to be an intimate and family thing. While my sister and her partner were there at the house while my dad was actively dying they were exhibiting PDA- rubbing each other’s collar bones; cuddling on the couch. My other sister said something about feeling uncomfortable because she just wanted to say goodbye to our dad without feeling like a third wheel in the family living room. My sister and her partner get upset ask her to apologize to them then they left. She’s made it clear to everyone that her partner is a permanent fixture in her life and will be around at every event.

Her partner is much older than her and has some health issues. Her partner complained about struggling financially and my sister makes a very large salary. So when they moved in together I was afraid that her partner would start to control her more because of the financial security my sister brings, her partner was previously in a relationship with a married person which makes me question my sisters judgment because my sister was totally fine with that setup. It makes me hesitant to trust that her partner is being faithful to her. Her partner has family in the area too. 

And her partner goes over to their family’s house without my sister, but my sister can’t seem to go anywhere without her partner. The relationship seems very clingy/codependent. My sister loves to feel needed and to be a caretaker and her partner seems to need to be taken care of. So I guess their relationship works for their personalities and that’s fine. I want her to be happy. 

I have been my sister’s ally since forever. When I was in bad relationships, she was always there for me. She never made me feel bad for making bad decisions in love and was always there for me in the aftermath. So I understand why she might feel hurt by my less than enthusiastic reception to her relationship. I understand that my sister is in a new relationship and feels like it’s them against the world. Everyone wants to feel accepted and to have validation. I feel like I may be harming my relationship with her by not blindly accepting her new relationship and just accepting them with open arms. I would be angry if she told me she didn’t ever want me to bring my husband around. 

I love my sister. I want a relationship with her. She is always welcome to come over or to come join us on family outings, but I don’t want to always have her partner around every time. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting my kids around people who act like this?? Or should I accept my sisters new partner even though I feel uncomfortable?

50,1gjzaic,AITA for accidentally causing a fire at my friend’s house and feeling frustrated by her reaction?,"I (29f) had a close friendship with a former colleague (31f) who was a lawyer at my old job. She became a mentor to me, encouraging me to go to law school. When she opened her business, I helped out with various tasks, mostly unpaid or for small gifts. I didn’t mind much—I wanted to support her.

A couple of years in, she went through a tough breakup. Her ex cheated and gave her HPV. I spent hours on the phone, letting her vent and promising to be there for anything she needed. After her vacation, she invited me over to her new house to decompress. On the way, she asked me to pick up an expensive pizza. Even though it strained my finances, I didn’t mention it because I didn’t want her to feel uncomfortable.

When I arrived, she reheated the pizza in her gas oven, but the boxes didn’t fit well. I suggested it might not be safe, but she insisted it would be fine. While we were chatting, I noticed smoke from the oven. I panicked, thinking to throw water on it, but she stopped me, saying she had a fire extinguisher. It was still wrapped in plastic, and smoke filled the house as she struggled with it. She eventually handed it to me, and I managed to put out the fire.

Once things settled, she called the pizza place and negotiated a replacement for free. I was a bit uncomfortable, but went along. We spent the rest of the evening as planned, and she act totally normal as if nothing happened.

A couple of days later, she messaged saying she needed “distance” to reflect on our friendship. I was confused and hurt, as I’d tried my best to support her. I apologized, saying I was sorry for any disrespect. She mentioned the incident “scarred” her new home and that she needed a new oven. She suggested we meet to talk, but over the next weeks, she rescheduled or canceled five times, leaving me emotionally drained. Each time, I prepared myself, only to be let down.

Finally, I gently told her just to let me know when she was actually available, as it was hard to keep getting canceled on. I was already struggling with my mental health, so the repeated cancellations took a toll. It felt like she saw me as an assistant outside of work, rather than as an equal friend.

Since then, she’s completely stopped reaching out. I’m sad to have lost both a friend and mentor, but I also feel conflicted. Did I ruin a friendship by not being open about my feelings earlier? Or was I justified in feeling frustrated at how she treated me?

51,1gjyyhu,AITA for Not Sharing My Family’s Pasta Sauce Recipe with My Friend?,"

I (28F) have this old family recipe for pasta sauce that’s been passed down for generations. My mom taught me when I was a kid, and over time, it’s become “my thing.” I make it for all sorts of occasions—birthdays, family gatherings, and even just nights in with friends. Everyone raves about it, and I take a lot of pride in keeping it close to the original.

One of my closest friends, Emily, recently asked me for the recipe. She’s been experimenting in the kitchen lately and thought it would be fun to try making it herself. At first, I kind of laughed it off, saying something like, “Oh, maybe I’ll teach you someday,” but she kept pressing. Emily isn’t Italian and doesn’t have a lot of experience cooking from scratch, so I was a little hesitant. It felt weird giving away something that feels so tied to my family, especially since my mom always treated it as a bit of a “family-only” thing.

I tried explaining that it was a family recipe, and I didn’t feel comfortable giving it out. She got pretty annoyed, saying it was just sauce and not some “huge family heirloom.” She pointed out that I’d shared recipes with her before (which is true, but those were random ones I found online, not family recipes).

Now things are awkward between us. She’s been short with me ever since and even made a snarky comment at a dinner party about how I “gatekeep sauce.” A few mutual friends think I should’ve just given it to her to avoid drama, but others understand why I wanted to keep it private.

53,1gjysny,AITA for a 'friends' question to my partner,"Hello reddit,

I am currently fuming its been almost 24 hours since the incident occurred. I have been labelled the asshole by the other party I'll call everyone alias so my friend Cat (30F) and her fiancé I'll call Rob (24M). Me is Jade (25F) and my partner is Bill (24M).

Now, Cat came over unannounced yesterday as she'd had her fiancé's car broken into and they stole items of hers from the car. Awful that would happen and we were chatting and letting her know we had seen Rob earlier to share our sincere apologies for the loss of the items and the trauma it must have caused, as we did with as we sat and chatted now with Cat. Jokes and fun pursued, until I made a joke about the girls at Bill's work seeing Cat's engagement ring, as she went into Bills work to grab food as he works in hospitality and its a small town. They had lunch together as they are old friends and he was on break and one of the girls in the kitchen asked after cat left if that was his partner. (He said no definitely not, she's my best friends fiancé.) Anyways Cat after hearing me jest at the situation as we're friends said 'well actually Bill I have been meaning to ask' turns her chair and raises her hand to shush me, 'what did you think of me 4 years ago' .. 'like you used to chase me around discord you must have liked me, I used to have to run to Rob's chat to get away from you' .. At this point I am dead silent and shocked. My partner responds with 'Idk not really' Which made me mad too! So I left quietly to use the rest room, as they talk about how they met 4 years ago. She decides to notice me leaving and searches for me until she notices the bathroom locked as I sob. And says 'oh its ok she's just here' and returns to her chat.

I flush the toilet and pretend to let it go, I go check the chickens and collect the eggs as it's close to our back door. I return with the eggs and I hear her sing out ' are you ok Jade?' and I respond with 'NO' followed by 'I don't appreciate some bich asking my partner inappropriate questions cause she decides she chose the wrong friend I think you should leave'. I then closed myself in the bedroom and my partner asked for me to come out and talk about it with them. I did not. She uttered a sorry and left.

Now I have spoken to my partner and smoothed over that he also felt awful about her saying or asking such a question. He didn't know how to handle it. However, Rob her fiancé after Bill told him, Rob seems to think after speaking with Cat that it was fine she wanted to apologise if she hurt Bill 4 years ago by choosing Rob. I think that is rubbish. And now I am angry at Rob for also stating 'its the girls problem Jade shouldn't have taken that so far'. so I guess I am here for the internet dump and I am unbelievable upset.

55,1gjy9l8,AITA for opening my husband’s package? ,"I (28) and my husband (30) just married earlier this year. Since we took our relationship to the next level, we decided to not renew our lease with our roommate and get our own spot. During the past 6 months of living together, just us two and my cat, I mostly get a ton of packages sent to our door. 

Whenever I place orders, especially through Amazon, I always give my husband a heads up. Not for any other reason. Yesterday, I gave him a heads up that I was ordering 3 things for my sibling. I was the first to get home today and noticed 3 packages. I ordered my sibling semi big things, and immediately opened up the boxes to wash before I head their way tonight. Shortly after opening the first box, I noticed a bright color that couldn’t have been what I ordered. I quickly checked the address, it was addressed to my husband, and I set it aside and continued to open the other 2 boxes. Somehow Amazon figured out a way to condense my order only into 2 packages. I thought nothing of it. 
My husband and I then had our daily ‘after-work’ phone call, where we discuss what happened throughout our days and he quickly threw out that he should have a package waiting for him. I then told him I accidentally opened it, but set it aside for him to completely open when he got home. 

The conversation then took a turn when he began to scold me about opening his packages. I reminded him of my order and explained to him that it wasn’t intentional. That I was just expecting my orders for my sibling and wanted to prepare their stuff before I gave it to them later. This explanation wasn’t good enough. 

My husband made it seem that I was being negligent, and that “common sense is to look at the address before opening any package or mail”. Although I agree with this, I don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door. I was expecting the package and opened it because I thought it was mine. I also feel since we are married, it shouldn’t matter that I opened the package on accident. It’s not like I took everything out. I simply took my key swiped it across the tape and noticed it wasn’t mine, and set it aside. 

After arguing in circles, his solution was for me to check every label before opening anything and my solution is a heads up after placing an order. I told him I’ll work on looking at the label, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to tell me when he’s expecting a package. We left the conversation annoyed at each other.

56,1gjy0y7,AITA for asking my roommate to close the door when she's having sex,"Me (21f) and my roommate (28f) have been living together for about 8 months now and we get along really well. We've had some issues, admittedly because I am way messier than she is. I always thought that we had good communication though, and we have seemed to talk it out mostly reaching a conclusion. During these 8 months my boyfriend (23m) has come around the house many times. Every time he sleeps over, I make sure she didn't have any problems the night before and always ask her if we were being loud. We have never had a problem with him coming over before.

Today, my roommate brought over the guy she is seeing. He has been around a bit and I don't really mind it usually. Today, however, they came home when i was sleeping (seasonal depression has me sleeping at 8:30pm), and I woke up to the sound of them fucking. This has never happened before, and i decided to go outside to give them more privacy. On my way out, i noticed that her door was wide open. when I got outside, I texted her this: ""hey... sorry to say this but can you please close your door? I can hear everything."", ""I came outside now but if you can, please."" I don't know what i expected, but she simply replied ""sorry I never told you when you were too noisy with your visits"". I immediately felt horrible and apologized, and said you could have said something before and she just says ""ok. i try to be more understanding"". I didn't mean to embarrass her but i literally woke up to the sound of them, I just thought maybe she could close the door, which she has in the past but now she says she can't because of the cat.  I think I should have just put on some music and not said anything, but I just didn't think it would be a big deal. I always thought she would also tell me if/when I make her uncomfortable.

I'm still living with my parents and my sisters so, try as I might, preserving my peace is rarely a piece of cake. Earlier this week, my sister and I had an ugly fight about whether or not she had to give a heads up when her boyfriend is coming over. 

The two of them been dating for three months and, as couples do, they'll often spend their Friday evening at our place. I have to specify: I have no problem with the boyfriend. He is very nice, very polite. When they are together, they watch a movie in the living room without disturbing anyone.

However, I don't know him that well yet and it's kinda weird having him around... he is still a stranger to me! That's why I'd like to be informed if and when he'll be there. I don't want to have a surprise when I come out of my room in my pajamas, you know? 

I am not - and I will never - require that my sister asks for my permission before inviting her boyfriend. The house is a shared space, as much hers as mine.

59,1gjxk6s,AITA for telling my sister to stop being weird about our little sister’s eagerness with her boyfriend?,"I don’t use reddit so my husband made this account for me to post.

I (31F) have two sisters, “Claire” (27F) and “Anne” (20F). Growing up, I had to take on a motherly role for Anne since we don’t have a dad and our mother was absent - which in turn made every ex-boyfriend and my now husband also have a type of fatherly role for her (taking her to a father-daughter dance, teaching her how to ride a bike, she wants my husband to walk her down the aisle, etc).

Claire is, for the first time, dating a guy “Roger” for long enough that we got to meet him. Anne was extremely excited “to get a new person in the family” and the first dinner was ok, she was her usual chatty self and she was all over him (my husband even joked he was being replaced). Claire was a bit moody and snarky but that's just how she is, so I didn't think much about it. The problem started with dinner at my house. Anne cooked the whole food. She was nervous because she felt he didn’t like her much so she was trying extra hard. She kept telling him that she cooked this and that (she just wanted a compliment on it) and Claire rolled her eyes and snapped with something like “he gets it, you’re very wife material”.

Later the five of us are drinking wine on the porch and dancing. At some point a certain song started and Anne gasped and cheered up saying how she tried to teach my husband this dance but he couldn't do it (tiktok dance for what i understood) and asked Roger if he could try it with her. She kinda gets to do it for like ten seconds before Claire starts yelling and tells Anne to stop being such a whore. She goes on about how Anne’s dressed and how she’s acting desperate and thinking it's cute to act like that to other people’s men. I told her no one is trying to steal her man and she’s acting completely insane. They left and we got to talk through the phone the next day (she was ignoring Anne’s calls) and she rants about the same things and I’m again annoyed that she’s acting it was malicious on Anne’s part.

If she had just been annoyed that Anne was being too much, I’d have understood. Like yeah Anne is like an overly-hyper puppy so I get it, it’d have been ok for Claire to tell her to back off because not everyone wants to be her friend. But it was the fact that she made it seem like it was something malicious on Anne’s part. It felt very disingenuous, especially since Anne is *so* naive and also has never shown any interest in dating ever. She just got so excited to have someone new (especially older and male) in her life and it felt wrong that Claire made her feel so self conscious about it.

But also… I get it, it's a girl being eager with your boyfriend and then trying to do tiktok dances with him. I \*could\* understand how people might think this is totally weird and inappropriate, but I think someone that’s naive enough to downright say “I’m gonna cook for him because I want him to like me” is not someone that’s trying to sneakily steal someone’s man.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: Was asked for INFO in a handfull of comments and I can't belive I didn't mention it. Is Anne special needs/delayed/diagnosed with something? She was in special needs class growing up and her boss tried to get her tested because he thought they could get a tax reduction with her but it didn't end up happening. No diagnosis. I'd say it's ADHD and a bit of a low IQ but I'm not qualified to judge that.

EDIT: Thank you for the harsh judgment guys. I’ve apologized to Claire (which led to a very emotional conversation about our upbringing, which made me apologize for giving Anne more attention), Anne had already been apologizing since that night and now Claire finally responded and apologized too, saying she knew Anne wasn’t flirting with him, she just felt insecure and jealous. The whole conversation with the three of us was very long and emotional and it was so much more than the dinner so thank you guys for giving me a reality check. (Anne’s gonna start therapy).

After 20 minutes of back and forth, I ended the conversation by saying I did not want to talk about it anymore, given the conversation was no longer productive, and honestly, I was so fed up that I said ""the right person for me would have similar morals and values"". This led to an even bigger argument and I just stopped at the fact of yes, you are proving to not be the right person for me. Thoughts?",,1.056686282157898,1,0

I, a 24 year old man, was visiting my hometown for a holiday at my mother’s house. On my last day in town I was planning on leaving late that night so I could dodge traffic going through L.A. and I decided to take a nap so I didn’t get sleepy on the road. Since my mom and sister would be asleep by the time I woke up to leave I decided to tell both goodbye before I got in bed. When I said goodbye to my mom she responded with “well make sure you don’t fall asleep and crash on the road”. This statement just made me really confused and I just instinctually responded with “um, yeah? That’s…why I’m taking a nap.” In an admittedly sarcastic tone. She just rolled her eyes hugged me goodbye than walked away. Normally her statement on its own wouldn’t really annoy me but she had recently started to making comments to me like “well make sure you don’t get addicted.” if I even MENTION taking so much as a single sleeping pill. In all my 24 years of life I have never been close to having a substance abuse issue of any kind and while I understand it can pretty much happen to anyone, she definitely doesn’t think I have one so what’s the point in saying that seemingly passive aggressive comment to me? When I talked to my sister about all this later she said I probably should have just nodded my head and agreed with her and that annoyed me even more.

64,1gjwrpv,WIBTA-for skipping my kid's birthday party because it's at my ex-husbands?,"My ex and I divorced in 2021. We had struggles and those struggles got disseminated to his friends and family pretty widely while we were still ""trying"" to work together. Once divorce was final, I tried to be the nice ex and do the joint friends/family kids birthdays. The first year, his friends made cutting comments behind my back (in my home) because I was frustrated with him. The reason for my frustration being that he offered to help set up since it was at my house, he arrived 10 minutes before everyone and then proceeded to act like he still lived there. Zero help given, partial credit accepted. (The next year less help and I decided separate family events after that and avoid the dynamics) He also told me at one point that his sister never came home to visit because I caused a shitshow with their parents. The same parents she wouldn't tell when she was visiting so she could avoid them. The same parents who visited her less than a handful of times during the decade of our marriage. I will be frank, his father is a partial reason I gave up on our marriage. I was told that he is the way he is and I'm going to have to get over it. He did some things that felt pretty violating and our marriage counselor agreed with that description so yeah. I don't want to be around them. 

But its been a constant struggle with establishing boundaries. It took him 2-3 years to not just walk in and then I seem difficult when I tell him the kids will be out in a minute. 

And it's not just him, the boundaries have been crossed by my family as well. My grandmother asked me in church one Sunday if she could invite him to the extended family dinner for Christmas. What was I supposed to say!?!?! My cousins were confused to say the least. It has been this way now and I just have kind of given up. The first time my immediate family drew a firm line was this past Christmas when they told him he couldn't come because my boyfriend would be there and they didn't want awkwardness. It took three years. My boyfriend is a bit of a saint for dealing with it all but he gets frustrated by it for me. 

So here's my dilemma. I have my kiddo on their birthday. I wanted to invite my immediate family over for dinner and cake. I knew he wanted to throw the friends, family, neighbors, school mates, etc party this year. I wasn't going to take away from that but he invited my immediate family and they have decided to all go. Do I go and be uncomfortable the entire time and potentially make it even worse? Or can I make their birthday special beforehand and skip out on the social show? 

And for those concerned about finances...I will be having a sleepover party the week after, so I will still be paying to help cover my kids birthday festivities in my own way.

65,1gjwr5s,AITA for going m.i.a after fight with dad.,"Context:

I (24 f) live in a rural area with my Mum, I don't leave the property much as I work from home. I do all cooking, chores and maintenance for the property. My Mum works in town 5 days a week and is in the process of splitting with my Dad who is retired used to run the farm and now lives in the city, he isn't supposed to stay nights but often will (honestly cant even say why anymore as hes used every excuse under the sun.) 

Issue: 

Last week my dad came to stay the night as he was going to do some work for my uncle. 

It was a very busy day (one of those days when you don't eat) he rocked up he immediately started to do 'jobs' that didn't need to be done. Which caused some problems that he blamed on everything but himself.

Not a huge deal but an inconvenience nonetheless.

I'd organise a neighbour to come over and help me with some two person jobs (would of told him not to come round if he had a mobile phone). 

The neighbour is an old mate of my dads so I wasn't surprised that they got to talking, I was surprised that my dad basically made me look like an idiot and pushed me out of the conversation. 

I only got a hello and a thank you in during the time it took to get the jobs done before I  picked that I was wanted around their conversation. He ended up staying an extra hour to talk to my dad.

When dad did come in I was in the middle of cooking dinner whilst my mum was having a shower. Instead of asking if I needed help he just grabbed a drink and sat in front of the TV. 

I planned to have a shower after my mum (as I was absolutely filthy) but my dad decided he'd have a shower next, which irked me alot but if I rushed I could still finish before our fav tv show started (on aired TV so can't pause).

When I get out of the shower I find that he's used my towel, which he has done before (a month ago) because it was ""in his towels spot"" and ""was his towels colour"". 

This time my towel wasn't in his 'spot' and it wasn't even the same colour.

In my hangry state I did lose it, which he'd found funny.

I'd said ""Are you just blind or stupid?"" he'd stopped laughing at that and it made the situation worse and I'll admit wasn't right of me to do.

I ended up just dishing up my food and going to my room to eat and then sleep.

The next morning whilst I had done all the chores, he had broke the toilet and a few taps claiming he was trying to fix them. 

My brain just snapped

I ended up leaving without telling anyone around lunch time to go down to the city and stay with my sister. I had planned to go the next day as I had an appointment. 

(I made sure all animals had plenty of food and water before I left)
 
I'm back on the farm and have appologise to my mum but haven't said anything of the sort to my dad (staying with my uncle). He's aparently very 'hurt' by what I did but he hasn't said a thing (text, call or in person) to me in regards to it.

My fiancé doesn't get to see his family much, due to living an hour from them & a lot of them tend to be not good to be around for his mental health.
But he hasn't been able to see his brother a lot over the last 6 years or so. He's only seen him a handful of times.

Anyways fast forward to today, I worked today, picked him up after work and we went home. He is having a couple drinks while on his game and out of nowhere he says ""I think my brothers going to be coming over this weekend and maybe have a couple drinks""

And I responded with ""oh... alright.""

He said ""what?""

I replied with ""oh nothing, I just wish you would asked me if I minded if he came over so I wouldn't feel like I wasn't being considered and if you would’ve just asked I would’ve said yes, but I don’t know how I feel about a 19 year old drinking in our apartment."" 

He goes on this rant about how he pays for half of the bills and how it's our apartment and if he wants to see his brother & drink with him, he's allowed especially because he doesn't get to see him ever.

Then I pop off with “well then I don’t want him here at all!”

And all I could say back was ""I also pay half the bills and this is also my apartment and I would still like to feel considered in decisions on who is and isn't going to be at our apartment, I should get a choice and/or opinion on the matter""

69,1gjvrae,WIBTA if I kick my roommates girlfriend out?,"Okay, so I (28M) have a roommate situation that’s been driving me absolutely insane, and I need some perspective. I live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my friend Mike (28), and everything was fine until his girlfriend (let’s call her Sarah, 22F) started basically living here too—without ever really *moving in* if that makes sense. 

Mike and Sarah have been dating for about 6 months now, and I have no problem with her being here sometimes—except she’s *always* here now. And she’s, like, constantly eating and leaving stuff everywhere. Like, there’s always food on the counter, and half the time it’s just leftover bags of chips, takeout containers, or the crumbs that have somehow turned into a permanent part of the couch. I mean, I know it’s a shared space, but it’s become impossible to live here with the constant mess.

But that’s not even the worst part. The worst part is how *loud* they are. I'm talking full-on bickering, loud Netflix marathons at 2 AM, and Sarah eating in the loudest way possible—like, she’s trying to make *every* bite of food sound like a life-or-death experience. And don’t even get me started on the smell. It’s like every day they decide to order the greasiest pizza or the most pungent Chinese food, and I can’t escape it because it just lingers for hours.

Now, I know people are going to say I should talk to Mike about it, and I have. I’ve told him multiple times that it's too much and that it’s not fair to me as his roommate. But he just brushes it off, saying that ""she’s going through some stuff"" and ""I should be more understanding"" (I mean, okay, but we’re all adults here, right?). 

And the worst part? Every time I try to hang out with him or even relax, Sarah is somehow *always* there. She doesn’t even live here, but she acts like it’s her second home, leaving her stuff everywhere, occupying the bathroom for *way* too long, and never cleaning up after herself. I feel like I don’t even have a place to chill anymore because she’s *always* here, and Mike doesn’t seem to care. 

I get that relationships are important, but this is my home too, and it feels like I’m being totally ignored. It’s honestly to the point where I’m considering telling Mike that either she moves out, or I do, because this is becoming unbearable. Am I the asshole for wanting them both to move out? I really don’t want to sound like the bad guy, but I feel like I have no space left.

71,1gjvn9t,AITA for not giving my aunt a family heirloom?,"My parents passed right before Christmas last year. It’s been a hard year for all of us. They lived in Houston, and none of us kids live in state. Their care and estate required a lot of time away from home, and heartache. My brothers and I have been slowly working through the estate and finally got to where we were ready for a sale company to come in.

While preparing the property, I set aside a few heirlooms to care for and pass down. One was a silver christening cup and spoon my father had on display.

On my last trip down, I stayed a few days to visit an aunt in San Antonio, take her shopping, out to dinner, et . She and I have always been close.

When I arrived, I thought she’d enjoy seeing some of the family heirlooms I had saved, so I showed her what I had found.

She immediately started telling me I needed to give them to her, that they were all things she should have been given when my grandparents passed. I knew I had made a mistake showing her.

One item was my father’s silver christening cup. When I went to put it away, she said, “You’re not leaving that with me?” I asked why she thought I would. That night was hard. She screamed at me until I had enough and said she had to stop. She’s 89 years old. 

What is she going to do with this cup? It’s time to stop being greedy. My dad was out of state when my grandparents died.

All he had was what his parents gave him while alive, and now she was demanding those items, too.

I left before she woke up the next morning and left a note thanking her for her hospitality, that I loved her, and hoped we’d speak soon.

She ignored me for weeks and when she did reach out, it was only to berate me about this cup and spoon, demanding it be handed over.

In my last text, I told her she meant too much to me for our relationship to suffer over this and offered to send it to her. I feel like I’m being bullied into it.

Over the last few days, I’ve kept up my messages with her, sending photos of the garden, family updates, and so on. She usually would respond but hasn’t replied.

Earlier today she called me screaming, ordering me send this cup and spoon to her.

I told her if she didn’t stop yelling I’d have to end the call, and when she kept on, I did.

I’ve never hung up on her or raised my voice to her in my life. It broke my heart.

I think much of this is due to her age and mental decline, but I remain loving and respectful. I’ve kept her daughters apprised of the behavior and that I feel terrible the cup situation has her so upset, that I’ve offered to send her the cup, but they haven’t responded at all.

So, AITA? I feel terrible and so sad. She’s the last remaining relative of her generation, but my brothers & I have been through so much over the last year. I just cannot believe she’s behaved this way when she knows we’re deep in grief and overwhelmed by the estate.

72,1gjvczp,WIBTA if I ask my partner to get their drivers license,"My partner has never gotten a license, he’s now 28M and still has no interest in pursuing a license. 
It’s getting frustrating, we don’t live somewhere with any good public transit so 99% of the time he has to get rides or I have to drive him… 
It seems like sometimes he recognizes that it’s inconvenient and uncomfortable for me and his friends, he’ll say stuff like
 “haha I should stop being a bum and get a license and a car huh” 

but then when I try to encourage him to drive he shuts down. 
I offer to teach him, to let him use my car to practice, and to even walk him through the test. He just ignores me and goes silent… what do I do? 

edit: read over everyone’s responses thanks y’all for the honest feedback. 

To answer a few questions: 
No he does not have a physical condition that prevents him from driving. 

And No he does not pay rent… he lives at home with his 68 year old mother. He instead is a “struggling artist” and allows her to break her back working as a bus driver and live off her dime. 

I spoke to him about this being a deal breaker for me and he gave me a very strange answer- 
He said 
“My mom never taught me because her mom died in a car accident, so I would rather people think I’m lazy then make fun of my mom.”

Which to me doesn’t even make sense? Your mom didn’t teach you 10 years ago… you can still learn now. If she’s so scared of cars why is she a city bus driver? 
I think it’s a cop out 

I asked if HE had fear around cars and he said “a little bit” 
and then changed the subject. 

I think I’m done with this relationship, I can’t see marrying someone like this. 
I’m going to end things tonight-

75,1gjuz25,AITA for only offering my sister a 10% share of our late father’s Will instead of an even 20%,"I (30M) have two older half sisters (44F)(39F) who each have their own mother, and a younger brother (27M)

Our eldest sister lives in Africa (she is 1/4 African we are not)

Our father passed away 3 months ago. He had a family trust which posses half his assets and it is split evenly amongst the 4 children.

His Will holds another house worth ~1.7 million dollars. This house is split between the younger three siblings and his caretaker who worked for him for 20 years and invested a small sum into a business he owned. There is also a house in Africa which he has left to my eldest sisters grandmother.

My father and eldest sister had an argument two years ago over a house my sister owned. I wasn’t involved and my Dad knew I had a good relationship with my sister so he didn’t involve me in any way.

My eldest sister spoke to me about the argument once when he was alive and mentioned that he threatened to cut her out of the Will.

My two oldest sisters don’t talk and haven’t for years, again because of a financial dispute over the same house.

When our Dad died and I read the Will I immediately told my sisters that I felt it unfair. The Will was written 2 years ago when the big dispute happened and I felt like the relationship between my dad and eldest sister had been improving. I felt that perhaps he would have updated the Will had he lived longer. I don’t think he expected to die (I certainly didn’t) but also he had been in hospital for many months and was 72

Fast forward a couple months and my two sisters are still not talking, but we have proposed that all 4 of us dilute our share of the 1.7 million dollar house from 25% to 22.5% so that out other sister can get 10%

I spoke to the eldest sister on the phone and she was unhappy with only being offered 10% and instead wants an even 20% between the 5 of us.

I haven’t spoken to her since yet but after thinking about it for a day I feel it’s wrong that she feels so entitled. I felt the additional 10% was a nice gesture, especially considering she will still get 25% of the trust. AITA? 

Edit: I realise now that I’ve been out of line trying to change his Will. Part of this is because I never considered the fact that he could die seriously, despite ample evidence. I assumed he and others shared the same cognitive blind spot, an assumption I now realise is incorrect. (From this I incorrectly assumed the Will was just out of date)

77,1gju9l4,"AITAH for using ""I love you"" as a goodbye? ","
So, for context, I have generalized anxiety disorder and often get extremely anxious that any time I see a loved one could be the last time. I believe this is a fairly common way of thinking, especially for people with anxiety. So, I always end conversations with people I'm close to with a quick ""I love you"". I think it's nice, it's a good reminder to them that they are loved and it eases my anxiety a little to know that even if something horrible happens, the last thing that I ever said to them was ""I love you"". Of course, if someone is uncomfortable with that then I readjust and don't say it to them and of course there is no expectation or pressure to say it back.

The issue started when I began saying this to a newer friend group. It was seven people including myself and we had been friends for about 3 months. I know that seems fast but I give my affection pretty freely and I genuinely loved these friends, my family was in tatters and I was struggling with a lot so they felt like my found family. When I said ""I love you guys"" for the first time, most said it back. A couple of them just smiled, didn't look uncomfortable as far as I could tell, and never mentioned any problem with it. In retrospect I probably should have just asked them upfront if they were uncomfortable.

So from then on, I would casually say ""I love you"" to the group anytime we parted ways. We ate meals together and saw eachother a couple times a day, so I was saying this to the group multiple times a day. Maybe a bit excessive, but it was just my way of saying goodbye. One day, a couple weeks into this happening, one member of the group finally snapped.

Apparently it was actually bothering them this whole time, making them very upset and uncomfortable. They yelled at me and went on this long rant about how it's disgusting and weird that I would say that to my friends, that by saying it so much I was pressuring them to say it back, that I don't even mean it because I was just saying goodbye and it was obnoxious to say ""I love you"" every time I actually just mean bye. By this point, I was crying and got defensive. The criticisms they brought up were valid and did make me think about my words more, but I said that they should have been nicer about it, should have communicated with me in the first place instead of bottling it up until they exploded on me, and basically called them an asshole who doesn't know how to communicate.

Obviously, I never said I loved them after that and we are no longer friends (there were other conflicts other than this incident). I still think about this interaction a lot and it makes me worried about expressing my love for my friends I'm the future. Am I the asshole?

78,1gjtnxf,AITA for Not Being There for My Friend?,"About a month ago, my best friend hinted that he was going to break up with his girlfriend of four years. He said it was a tough time, and I sympathized. A few days later, while I was in the Caribbean with my girlfriend, I got a text from him saying, ""I wish you could be here right now, I really need someone to talk to."" I assumed this meant he was struggling with his relationship, so I offered to FaceTime him. He declined, saying, ""I couldn’t do that to you."" I didn’t know it at the time, but he'd already broken up with his girlfriend.

79,1gjtnac,"AITA for ""insulting"" my Amazon delivery driver and refusing to give him a fist bump?","So, I had a strange delivery experience today. I live on the second floor, and instead of coming up, the driver called me from his van. He acted like he didn’t understand that I could buzz him in or didn’t seem to understand English. Meanwhile, I’m trying to find my shoes, and in my rush to get downstairs, I trip at the doorway. It actually hurt, so I muttered “Holy fuck” while still on the phone with him, and he immediately hung up on me.

When I finally get downstairs, there he is, standing by the door he said he couldn’t get through, somehow having managed to open it. I asked, “What was the issue with the door?” since he clearly got it open by himself. His response was, “Did you just tell me to go fuck myself?”

I was surprised and tried to explain what happened, but he insisted I’d insulted him. He wouldn’t give me the package until I gave him a fist bump, which felt awkward. This driver delivers here often, and each time there’s been some kind of issue, so I’m not sure what to make of it.

**Edit 1:** I mentioned the language barrier because other residents have commented on similar interactions with him, so it’s not just something I noticed.

**Edit 2:** I also want to mention that I felt genuinely bad that he thought I’d insulted him, and I did my best to explain calmly. I just wasn’t sure how to handle him insisting I was lying, and then refusing to give me the package until I fist-bumped him.

**Edit 3:** I tend to struggle with social interactions and am pretty withdrawn, so it’s hard for me to figure out if I misread things here or handled it badly. I’m just looking for perspective.

80,1gjtg3m,AITA (20F) for making my (30M) boyfriend sick from chicken pot pie?,"I (23F) made my (33M) partner sick eating chicken pot pie. At the time, I was a single mom and my boyfriend, now husband, was going shopping at the local Sam’s club. He had made it very clear before this that he has had a food aversion to chicken pot pie all of his life. Every time he eats it he gets sick. I, on the other hand, loved pot pie and could eat it all the time. There is only one time of year (during the colder seasons) that this store sells the house made chicken pot pies to take home and bake. I saw the pie, and I basically begged that we take it home. I also made it clear that he did not have to eat it, that he could eat something else if he wanted, but that I was craving the pie and wanted to eat it. After a bit of convincing he agreed to get the pot pie.

Both of us are stoners so we were baked that night, about as baked as that pot pie. After the pie was baked, I can’t lie, the aroma filled my small apartment. We fed ourselves and he grabbed a piece to my surprise. I asked if he was sure and he said it would be fine. After he finished he went back for several more portions. He must have eaten at least half the pie after he was done. I was surprised…

Later that night I see him quickly make his way to the bathroom after tossing and turning in the bed next to me. I got up to check on him and immediately heard him getting sick. He opens the door abruptly and I startle him standing in front of him. I ask if he’s okay while peering into the full SINK of vomit. It was a normal bathroom sink filled to the brim with vomit. I brought him back to bed and let him sleep, but his breath made me ill. I made my way to the livingroom to sleep on the couch but I couldn’t because the smell of the vomit was wafting through my apartment. 

I have emetophobia (the fear of vomit) and realized that if I don’t clean the sink I will be miserable all night. I got to work. I found out that my sink was broken. I fixed the sink, cleaned the puke, and made sure everything was cleaned up. It took every ounce of strength I had and I still ended up getting sick myself cleaning it.

He came back to check to see what I was doing. He saw what I did and said “you cleaned it up. You didn’t have to do that, I was going to do that.” I replied,” I couldn’t sleep because of the smell so I cleaned it up.” He just said okay after and went back to bed. 

The next day I mentioned it to him. We ended up getting in a fight. He had accused me of making him sick because I knew that it would make him sick. I didn’t force him to eat it. This was almost 3 years ago and we still fight about it. He still has not genuinely apologized to me for blaming me and he has not thanked me for cleaning it up. Did I owe him?

I'll start by adding some content, I'm very asain, I was born in Japan and the only reason I'm mentioning this as stated in the title, her uncle is racist (pretty much the typical drunk uncle that spouts racist stuff at any family gathering) and the one time I met him he called me the slur for Asians three times and asked if I've eaten dog before. also after I said I was from Japan, he still insisted that I was clearly from china as he apparently was an expert on picking apart races as it's part of his job. He works in a bank.

Luckily my gf defended me but her family were somewhat nonchalant about what he did? Almost like they didn't care?

And I don't even know where to start with her brother, he is very into anime which I'm personally not into but it's fine he is. It's just that he seems to have a fixation with the fact I'm Japanese? Like when I was meeting her family for the first time, he immediately took notice of me and wouldn't stop asking questions? Which I understand as I'm new to the family and all but they were the strangest questions, like he asked me how hard it was to speak Japanese less in the us and that I could always speak with him so that I don't miss home as much?(his Japanese is horrendous, I could tell he's only memorised phrases from shows) and if I have any traditional Japanese items that I could show him?

I'm honestly weirded out by the both of them and when my girlfriend asked if I wanted to go to her family's thanksgiving this year I immediately said no. She was very upset with this answer as we all know the elections happen in a few days and it's going to be a political mess, and that she needed my support.

Every Sunday that Suzie comes back to the dorm, her mom also comes with her in our room to put her stuff away, clean, etc. Her mom doesn't stay a super long time (I would say 15-20min., on occasion longer), but mainly my issue is the time that she has her mom over.

85,1gkkfvc,AITA for my girlfriend not getting into the school she wanted?,"My girlfriend is a non-traditional college student. She completed her associate's last spring with a very high GPA and meant to apply to some prestigious schools. Whenever she started working on her applications, though, she would panic and shut down. She ended up missing all of her deadlines; she did complete her application for one Ivy League school, but didn't submit it at the last moment, saying it was embarrassing and that she had no place there.

I didn't know what to do in these moments, to be honest, but I am sure what I did wasn't right. She would really shut down and pull into herself, going into a thousand yard stare or breaking down in tears. I tried consoling her, but I can't remember a time it worked. I read over her application essays and made suggestions, but she would get defensive and reject them. I'm a pretty bad writer and she's a very good one, so that was likely the right call.

Now she's at a local public university and in tears every day because she finds it isn't the right fit. She blames me and tells me I didn't help enough, that she never felt supported through the process. I asked how I could have helped, and she called me an asshole, saying she didn't know ""how to explain how to help people."" She says she doesn't know if she can forgive me for this.

I am willing to accept I'm the asshole and I'm what's holding her back, but I legitimately don't know what I should have done. How does one help an adult shutting down? What was I supposed to do in this situation?

86,1gkkdod,AITA for asking my roommate to move out? ,"My (28F) roommate (43F) has been living with me since June. I own my house but wanted a roommate to help with bills and mortgage. We had known each other a year before hand as we were both members of a voluntary veterans group. 

When I first made the agreement I was under the impression they worked full time and also drew disability from Veteran Affairs, this means she gets 2400 a month plus what ever she makes. The rent was split 60/40 with the 60 being my part as it's three bedrooms and I kept two. I'll refer to my roommate as RA for the remainder of the post. RA's portion of rent was 1000 plus utilities. 

we met a few weeks in advance, RA has a daughter every other weekend which and I enjoyed showing her how to bake and was a great kid.  About a month ago RA approached me in tears stating they were unsure of the outcome of a case between RA and the daughters other parent. We talked it through and everything seemed fine. 

Fast forward to this last Saturday when rent was due. RA sent the amount like normal and I routed it to my bank which takes about 2 days. Later that night I received a text message that RAs bank had denied the transfer. RA informed me they over drew their bank account but now had the funds (1200$). 

 I texted RA asking if I could help in any way. I work with homeless and indigent individuals and assist with budgeting and utlizing resources. They said it was fine and they could send me 1000$ and then get the rest to me. So last night I was at a concert and got another message saying the transfer had again been denied. 

So today I sent a message stating I felt used as they could have told me they didn't have the money and I had already placed all my available funds into other debts and had to pull funds to make up for not paying bills. I also stated I needed to know a long term plan so that this doesnt happen again. I feel like a asshole. But I've been used before when I was younger and needed to lay the cards out. 

RA informed me that they had applied to normal SSDI so that they could pull VA disability and SSDI. I informed them you can't work while applying for SSDI or it will significantly lower your chances. RA stated they did not plan on working and to live off of disability. RA doesn't leave the house except to work and otherwise plays video games. 

RA is currently selling most of her possessions to make up the amount. I told them not to and we could work something out but they just left with most of their valuables. I never asked them to leave and repeatedly stated I struggled with housing when I was younger and they could stay until they found something.

88,1gkjl8j,AITA for not inviting my boyfriend for dinner?,"I really think this isn’t a big deal but I also felt a bit terrible so I need some perspective. Basically I was hosting a movie day with my friends at our place. My boyfriend is a pretty big introvert and most of my friends are quite loud, ADHD and just very extroverted, so he doesn't like to hang out with them all that much which is fine because they're my friends and not his. Because of this, we've discussed this beforehand about when people would be arriving/leaving and if someone could sleep over and whatnot. My boyfriend knew we were going to watch some movies but besides that I didn’t really discuss the agenda of the get together because I like it to be quite chill. In the end, we ended up ordering a couple pizza's and sharing it as we continued watching movies and I kind of forgot to include him in our dinner plans because all day he was either outside doing his own thing or in our reading room hanging out by himself. Now he’s saying it’s very inconsiderate of me that I didn’t include him in our dinner plans and that I should next time. I feel really bad but I also feel like he's a grown adult and could've spoken up or even ordered his own dinner if he wanted. AITA?

TLDR: my boyfriend excluded himself from my friends and I, and now feels upset that we didn’t include him with our dinner plans.

edit: thanks for your replies guys. I usually think of if I would mind if the roles were reversed and my thought process went ""well I was basically alone all day, so I’ll do dinner alone"" that’s why i couldn’t really figure it out. I wanted to know if it was a him-thing or a people-in-general-thing. Now I know, so thanks!
Couple clarifications; he’s not angry or anything. The convo went -""can you include me with dinner next time"" -""oh right I’m sorry"" -""thanks, it's okay we didn’t discuss it but now we know for next time"" -""yes next time I’ll think of it, sorry""
I like my boyfriend plenty, we are just very independent people so sometimes we forget to consider each other with making plans for things.

89,1gkjkdg,"AITA for planning the euthanisia of the family dog, despite my step-daughter's protests?","My husband and I live together and my stepdaughter (22) lives between our house and her mum's. She probably spends 65% of her time here. I also have a stepson but he's at university.

We have a 12 year old Labrador, Lola. Lola was dumped on my husband at the age of 1 by his ex (stepchildren's mum) because she couldn't be bothered with her and has a history of selling on family pets when she gets bored/overwhelmed with caring for them.

My husband took Lola in (and a cat, but that's another story) and has provided all of her care for 11 years. His kids would go out for walks with Lola as a family from time to time, but aside from that he does everything. I met Lola when she was 9 and her decline since then is very evident.

The problem is Lola has became senile and regardless of how many times we let her out before bed, we will wake up to urine/poo on the carpet. We rent so putting down better flooring isn't really an option. My husband has vaxxed the carpet every morning since I can remember due to this. It's unsanitary and we're embarrassed to have people over because of the stains and the smell, we literally can't keep on top of it. When Lola does pass on we will get the carpet a deep professional clean as many times as it's needed, but at the moment it would be a futile effort.

My husband works from home so Lola can use the garden whenever she needs. She can't really go on walks longer than 10 minutes anymore.

My husband and I are at the end of our tether and Lola's quality of life, if I'm honest, is shit. She sleeps, eats and then pisses/shits on the carpet at night. She's started barking through the night for no reason and we've had to put a stair gate up as she attempts to climb the stairs which her joints can't manage anymore.

Stepdaughter however, when we talk about euthanasia due to all of the above, tells us we want to euthanise Lola simply because we can't be bothered with her anymore. She feels that the situation with Lola's incontinence isn't enough to warrant euthanasia and that we are being heartless and overzealous. We advised today that this will probably be Lola's last Christmas and we'll make the most of it. Stepdaughter left the room crying.

I for the most part have tried to keep out of it despite the situation getting me down because this isn't my childhood dog, so I feel that I don't really get a say in it, despite living here. My husband has no attachment to Lola anymore because of the situation, and is still caring for her but resents her if I'm honest. Every time we try to bring up the subject, stepdaughter cries and leaves the room and it's causing a lot of tension in the house. We feel like she isn't appreciating how hard the incontinence is to manage/how unclean it is, she thinks we're heartless.

90,1gkiys9,AITA for wanting my parents to send me to a high tuition cost uni that they can very clearly afford. ,"Am I the asshole for wanting my parents to pay for a good university? 

Here’s the gist of it 

I want to transfer to a university in my city, Madrid, but it’s expensive, tuition is about 25k a year for 3 years, but I find it to be worth it. 

I’m currently attending a university I don’t like at all, and my parents clearly only chose it because the fees are cheaper. I don’t like the people, the teachers aren’t good and the campus is awful, I’m honestly depressed and I want to transfer to a different university. I could go on and on about how I hate the conservative religious bullshit the university is known for, or the poor level of education, the shitty campus that is quite literally just an old reformed school building.. it’s genuinely made me miserable. 

I already have friends who attend the other uni and from a reputation and networking standpoint it is the best in my country. And it’s closer to my house, and lessons are taught in English which is my first language. The one I currently attend can’t even give me a proper worksheet without evident syntax errors and broken English. 

Here’s the issue. My father alone makes 20k a month pre tax, but still refuses to pay for my tuition as he wants to retire before 60.. I have friends who’s parents are working hard and paying everything they can to afford them their dream unis… why can’t I get the same? 

Every time I bring up the uni my parents fixate and obsess over “cost efficient” alternatives. Like.. what?? You make 250 thousand a year and you can’t spend a few extra thousands to send me to a uni that is miles better than the one I’m in?  I can’t even push my parents on it because my mother starts yelling at me saying I’m manipulating them to pay for a posh uni tuition so I can slack off with rich kids all day. She won’t even hear me out or check reviews on the university. All she cares is that it’s known for being more “high end” when it comes to costs. 

What really drives me crazy is that my parents have genuinely said things like “but son.. if we pay for your tuition, when will I be able to buy myself a boat so I can go out on beach expeditions at our summer home?” 

Seriously??…???

My parents have genuinely proposed the idea of spending 100k on a boat/mini yacht instead of paying my college tuition for my dream uni and it’s made me fucking miserable.

92,1gkidf6,AITA for telling my friend to stop bothering me in class?,"Me (m15) and friend (m15) are in grade ten, and we’ve been best friends since grade eight. For some context, he’s an amazing friend, we just went trick or treating with each other and we’re like two peas and a pod. He’s a genuinely kind person and we both have so much in common. However, my friend has ADHD, and so do I, but I guess it’s different severities in this scenario. Since he constantly needs something in his hands, he’ll usually have a stress ball or some sort of thing to fidget with. Like an eraser, pencil, etc.

Ever since the beginning of grade ten, he’s been constantly poking me with sharp ass pencils, whipping me with some elastic or something, taking my things without me consenting or knowing. Or sometimes outright destroying stuff like karate chopping my pencil or twisting the long end on a pen cap off, etc. (We started school in August, and it’s been happening since.) even breaking a part of my binder once when he was really energetic. But it was still in tact.

I never minded too much at first, since I understood him. But he’s usually hyper and I’m the more tired one, so sometimes I just wanted to tell him to stop. But I struggle talking up, since I’m not very social and refrain from saying “no” a lot. But for the last couple weeks, it’s been getting more annoying and I’m really struggling to pay attention sometimes when he’s bugging me. Especially considering I’m kind of a perfectionist and I don’t like things that are even slightly damaged.

So yesterday, when he was poking me with a pencil and it was stinging. I told him that I would like him to stop, but not just a usual “stop”. I told him that since I respect his personal space all the time when he’s tired and when I’m rather energetic. And I don’t do that stuff when he’s literally sleeping in class, I never raised my voice when I said any of this, I kinda just told him in the tone as if we were having a normal conversation. But he would constantly do it when I’m trying to focus. Because this is annoying when I’m trying to take notes on the board and he’s whipping me with an elastic.

But today, he didn’t really talk to me as much. Hanging out more with some friends that I never really talked to, basically making me think, “is he distancing himself from me?” But I think he just maybe needed a break since he said he was tired, but he’d still sit with me in class if he was tired. And I was tired that morning too, so I’m not exactly sure.

93,1gki5pt,WIBTA If I Took My Cat When Moving?,"Throwaway because I don’t know if my father has a Reddit account.

I(19f) am soon moving in with my mother(60f) 2 and a half hours upstate for better opportunities. Currently, I am living with my father(60m) and my cat, who I will call Socks for the sake of anonymity.

I got Socks when I was maybe 16 with my father from the animal shelter and absolutely fell in love with him. He’s a sweet American Shorthair who looked very similar to a girl cat I used to have that had passed sometime in 2019. I had this girl cat for 9 years until she passed and was debilitating when I lost her.

Socks had unintentionally been an emotional support animal with me. If I don’t eat for a day, then he won’t eat. If I don’t come out of my room, he’ll meow and scratch at my door until I come out. To say he’s my best friend is an understatement.

My father on the other hand causes me more stress than anything. When I was 17, I was forced to live with him after getting out of a mental hospital, which he expected me to simple be adjusted from the day I moved in. The fact that he put so much pressure on me and the fact that I was still getting used to a new school and not living with my mother for the first time in my life, caused me to unfortunately drop out of high school. 

I plan to go back and get my GED, but since then, he has made no attempt to help me study, or encourage me. I wanted to get a job, but he wouldn’t allow me to for various excuses like “he can’t drive me because he works 8 hours a day”(i tried to compromise and told him i could probably work around his schedule), “Nobody is hiring”, or the worst “You have everything you need here”. 

He whines every time I want to go out and since I don’t have a license yet, he is my only form of transportation, essentially isolating me. He constantly plays Call of Duty and just before making this post, threw a fit because I wanted to finish a game I wanted and he wanted to play. I told him he could play tomorrow because I really wanted to finished this.

This is why I’m moving in with my mom. She is going to help me get my GED, a job, and a Drivers license while actively supporting me through it. Now here comes the issue, Socks. 

If I leave Socks, he definitely won’t eat, nobody will be reminded to give him his medicine(he’s asthmatic), and his overall mental health will deteriorate significantly. But my dad has also grown attached to him and would be really lonely without him. So..

94,1gkhp7b,AITA for telling my friends I don't want to rent with them the night they're trying to sign a lease?,"Hello. I am a 19 year old first-year college student, who about a week ago, agreed with a group of 5 friends that I'd be interested in living with them next school year. 

Yesterday, we found a place we really liked and talked about how we'd figure out the lease by the end of the week. Today they've decided they want to sign the lease ASAP/by tonight because the landlord explained that the market is competitive and they don't want to lose this nice house... But, reading through the lease has made me realize I don't want to do this financially. 

Even with the 5 of us, this would cost me $750/month or $9k to live there for august 2025-july 2026, not counting utilities... and that is money that could go towards classes (I am paying for school by myself and just came back from a gap year of working. I do not want to take any loans and have a lot of anxieties about going into debt after college because it happened to mom and it still effects her). My family also lives close enough to campus that I can just stay with them without having to pay anything.  

These friends are all from out of town so they need to find a place to stay. I feel like a dick now for saying I don't think I can as soon as they are trying to sign the place, because I definitely could with the money I have saved, but I know I'll regret it in the future. I know I really don't want to, but feel like I have to because they don't have anyone else and they need 5 people.

Right now I am banking on the fact that my parents refuse to co-sign, but I technically wouldn't need them because my credit score is better than the both of them. Do I continue to lie and say that my parents are the reason I can't sign? Most if not all of these places require us to have co-signers because we're so young, but my parents' financial history are so poor they don't think they'd be approved as co-signers

I feel like an asshole because this is causing them a lot of anxiety, but it would be better for my own anxiety in the long run if I stayed at home and saved the money... I don't know how any of them are paying for school, so I feel awkward and kind of like an asshole for suddenly saying I couldn't afford it.

96,1gkhfq7,AITA for refusing to let my wife spend my money on her best friend? ,"My wife has known her best friend since middle school. Her friend is a lawyer and her family is quite well off. She makes a lot and is pretty generous with it. My wife has had a few things paid for by her. Specifically she covered my wife’s portion of her bachelorette trip. The other friends didn’t make much and so she covered it. She also paid for a portion of my wife’s rent twice and she normally pays the bills if she and my wife go out for food. 

This friend is now marrying a doctor and I don’t think they have any trouble with paying for anything they want. My wife is a SAHM and I’m a mechanic. I bought home a bonus of $3k and when I told my wife she immediately started talking about getting her friend a really expensive necklace from this brand she knows her friend really wants. She showed me and the cheapest necklace is $2k on the website. She insisted I should spend the bonus on a wedding gift for her friend. I shut her down and told her it’s my bonus and she really cannot expect me to buy her friend something this expensive. I don’t think wedding gifts even exceed $100. She began fighting with me saying I buy lunch out of the house and I have stupid hobbies that cost a lot of money so why can’t she spend some money like buying her friend a necklace?

I do spend a bit on my hobbies and I have 2 cars but I also work my ass off and her friend can definitely pay for it herself. She is marrying a doctor and they already have a house whereas we are still renting!

99,1gkh9z2,AITA For Ditching My Bf When He Comes To Visit?,"My bf (m31) and I (f27) have been dating for a year and a half. I’m originally from one coast and he is from the other and we met in college near his hometown. Now that we are both out of school we live together in his hometown, but I make frequent trips across the country to visit my friends and family. This year he is accompanying me home for Christmas and it will be our first holiday season together. We will be staying with my family in my childhood home. 

Every year I host a Ladies Holiday party in December for my high school friend group. We were all close growing up and remain friends into adulthood. We all have busy lives and some have moved away so this is really the only time of year we can get together. The rule of the holiday party is that it is just the high school friend group. No partners, spouses, or kids. I host at my parent’s house and they enjoy getting to say hi to all my friends that they have known 15+ years. 

My boyfriend likes football so I planned to host the party on a Sunday when he could watch football in a back room while I throw my party for about 2 hours. I’d love for him to have a chance to meet those he hasn’t yet when they arrive without encroaching on our space. 

He is upset and feels that I am kicking him out. This previous winter I had some friends from high school come out to visit for my birthday. Bf and I were not living together at the time and my friends crashed at my place for 4 days. I was also in school at the time but ended up cutting my unnecessary classes that week to spend time with them but I was still gone 2-4 hours every day they were in town. At the time bf wanted some me time to himself to celebrate my birthday. He kept asking me to spend the night at his place.

AITA for hosting a party that excludes him for 2 hours while he is in town?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-05,"AITA For Ditching My Bf When He Comes To Visit? My bf (m31) and I (f27) have been dating for a year and a half. I’m originally from one coast and he is from the other and we met in college near his hometown. Now that we are both out of school we live together in his hometown, but I make frequent trips across the country to visit my friends and family. This year he is accompanying me home for Christmas and it will be our first holiday season together. We will be staying with my family in my childhood home. 

Every year I host a Ladies Holiday party in December for my high school friend group. We were all close growing up and remain friends into adulthood. We all have busy lives and some have moved away so this is really the only time of year we can get together. The rule of the holiday party is that it is just the high school friend group. No partners, spouses, or kids. I host at my parent’s house and they enjoy getting to say hi to all my friends that they have known 15+ years. 

My boyfriend likes football so I planned to host the party on a Sunday when he could watch football in a back room while I throw my party for about 2 hours. I’d love for him to have a chance to meet those he hasn’t yet when they arrive without encroaching on our space. 

He is upset and feels that I am kicking him out. This previous winter I had some friends from high school come out to visit for my birthday. Bf and I were not living together at the time and my friends crashed at my place for 4 days. I was also in school at the time but ended up cutting my unnecessary classes that week to spend time with them but I was still gone 2-4 hours every day they were in town. At the time bf wanted some me time to himself to celebrate my birthday. He kept asking me to spend the night at his place.

100,1gkgwuf,WIBTAH if I reported my (31F) Fiance's (32M) parents neighbor's dog?,"The neighbor in question is elderly and disabled with little to no support elsewhere. She trained (not a certified dog in any sense of the word) a German Shepherd to help her with a few things around the house. The things the dog cannot help with, my fiance's parents help her with. This being the case, our family is very close with her. She dotes on our daughter getting her gifts very often and states she feels like a 3rd grandmother.

My daughter (3) was at her grandparent's place after school and went down to this neighbor's house, as they often do to play with the dog and visit with the neighbor. Daughter's grandmother had gotten up to get something for the neighbor and turned her back for a second. In that second, the dog bit my daughter in the face. She has a gash wound ONE INCH from her right eye, a split lip, and raised scratches all over her face, trailing to her arm a little. They are obvious bite mark wounds and have been confirmed by the doctor when we took her to the ED shortly after.

Admittedly, in the beginning, we, her parents, decided not to report the dog and just not allow our daughter to go over there anymore. We encouraged Fiance's parents to also distance themselves for their safety. That is until Fiance received a call from the neighbor's husband.

The husband is claiming my daughter was near the dog, tripped, and hurt herself. He did not ask if she was okay, or how she was holding up. When it was expressed that we were disappointed he did not ask about how our daughter was doing and did not plan on reporting anything at this time (in the calmest tone he could muster) the husband doubled down and insisted Daughter had fallen. What would be on the floor of your house to cause a split lip and a gash an inch long on her face?!

The blatant disregard for my daughter's well-being really has me rethinking things, and I wasn't really all that far on the ""don't report it"" side to begin with. So, WIBTAH for reporting this dog that helps this woman, but is obviously dangerous?

TL;DR: Daughter was bit in the face by the dog of a lonely, disabled elderly woman. WIBTAH for reporting the dog?

**UPDATE:** Just going to update and address a few things I've seen mentioned a few times.

In my state, it is required by law for the hospital to report the incident to animal control. However, I've been informed that if they don't call me for further details the next day, there probably won't be any follow-up for the dog/owner.

My daughter is up to date on all her vaccines, including the DTaP for Tetanus, so an additional shot was not needed. She did get 3 facial images done to ensure there were no hairline fractures, and there are none thankfully. 

What I originally described as a gash is actually a deep puncture with a 1"" scratch coming from said wound about 1"" away from her eye. Upon further inspection, there are also deep scratches on her arms and a puncture on her jawline that was noticed at the ED, in addition to the split lip and other scratches on her face. Since it's been 24 hours since the incident, she now has a black eye, purple bottom lip, and several bruises on her face, neck, shoulders, and arms.

My daughter was not unattended with a large dog. The dog's owner was in the same room as my daughter and her dog. However, being unable to walk she could not get her dog off my daughter, so my MIL had to, who was in the kitchen a few feet away. The neighbor is refusing to tell me or my fiance what she saw happened. idk if this is because everything happened so fast she didn't really see it, or can't remember it from the shock and stress of it all, or if she saw exactly what happened and is worried for the future of her dog.

We have decided to call Animal Control, and expressed that we don't want the dog to get hurt, but feel it needs to be put on record in case this happens with someone else.

102,1gkgkbc,AITA for playing Fortnite with other guys when I have a bf? ,"My (31 f) bf (29 m) has issues with me playing Fortnite with other guys. 
Some context. My best friend got me into Fortnite a few months ago. I never was that interested in it, having played other BR games like pubG, but I got into it pretty quickly. I finally saw what all the appeal of Fortnite was with the skins, emotes, BR and the varieties of creative modes. 
Before FN, when I came home from work I would just doomscroll on my FB, IG or watch YT/Netflix. After doing that for a while I felt myself feeling slightly depressed. But finding this game made me happy to have something to look forward to when I got home from work, and it is a great way to decompress. I’m not really a social person, definitely more introverted so going out after work never really appealed to me. 
My boyfriend did play FN BR with me sometimes but he preferred to play other games like magic (mostly magic actually). And TBH he wasn’t the best teammate to play BR with as he tends to wander off and pick fights with players when I/ squads were not around. Not very good comms, even tho we are in the same room of the house. I would also play with my friend who got me into FN, but not often as we both are busy during different times of the day. I did play some random BR games but never really found any teammates that wanted to play again or add as a friend. 
I started going into creative lobbies where I mostly enjoyed emoting with other players. Running around, gaining XP in a low pressure situation was very fun to me, unlike the BR version which can stress me out when I’m taking shots from who knows where. 
Eventually I got comfortable a few times talking on the mic in the creative lobbies. Of course, I’m a girl so I got some attention from guys, but from what I can tell that’s normal and it “shocks” guys when they hear an actual girl playing the game. 
I did end up finding some people (guys and a couple girls) that I could chill and vibe with, and some of them were willing to help me level up and complete the battle pass. I accepted since I’ve only started playing a few months ago and will take the help. 
Now my bf has issues that I play with the same guys when I play FN. I have asked him to play with me when I’m playing with them but he just says no. He thinks these “relationships” I’m having are an issue but I don’t see what the fkn problem is. They don’t live in the same state as me, and the only thing we share is that we play the same game and want to level up. 
I will admit, one time I did share my insta with a dude who we played games together, my bf found out and I apologized and realize that yes that was fkd up, but I haven’t done it again since. Now I’m just keeping these people as friends only in the game. So I’m not sure what to do. My BF tried to give me an ultimatum “our relationship or this game” to which I said fk no, I don’t do ultimatums. I just think he is jealous.

Now I don’t know if he’s just ignorant or just doesn’t care, but he sorta just drapes the clothes over the railing rather than hanging them up properly. What ends up happening is that smaller and thinner pieces of clothing like lingerie (bras and underwear and whatnot) end up falling off the railing where the wind then carries them to MY balcony.

Even so, mistakes happen so I take any that fell inside, make sure they get properly dried, and hold onto them until I can awkwardly return them the next morning. The wife is obviously embarrassed but thankful towards me for not letting her lingerie get lost.

Fast forward many months and this is still happening like clockwork on a weekly basis. Me and the wife are now pretty much on an unofficial schedule that she comes by my apartment to pick up her lingerie the morning after laundry day. It doesn’t matter how many times she tells her husband to fix the problem it never changes (she works during the time they need to be hanged so she can’t do it herself.

Now after all of this, I run into her husband one afternoon and he’s ANNOYED at me. He didn’t shout, more sharply worded, but he made his point clear. He doesn’t like what I’ve been doing, I shouldn’t be touching his wife’s lingerie let alone keeping it overnight in my apartment. According to him, me taking a married woman’s intimate clotting is creepy and violating. And if I was really just returning it I wouldn’t keep it overnight and instead come to their apartment late at night to return it immediately. He also spent a while completing that his wife was giving him a hard time for how he was hanging the clothes thanks to me. Calling it an “asshole move” on my part.

I don’t believe I’m the asshole in this situation. I’m the one making up for HIS mistake’s and returning the lingerie to its owner at my earliest convenience. Like a good neighbour SHOULD do. I get that it’s a very intimate item but I feel like I’m innocent here. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-05,"AITA for picking up my neighbour’s lingerie?

108,1gketa4,AITA For adding salt to my meal at a gathering?,"I (F) am in my late teens, and went to a dinner gathering with my family, and a couple of other families. I am anemic, and have had some fainting spells in the last few weeks, and my doctor is slightly concerned about my low blood pressure readings. So instead of putting me on meds, she’s advised me to add some things in my day to day lifestyle to try and naturally increase my blood pressure, including drinking plenty of water and increasing my salt intake. 

This means whenever i can (and remember), I try add a pinch of salt to my food/drink, and eat foods rich in iron etc. At this dinner, I dished my food, and went to sit next to my mother and family friends in the living room (there were around 20ppl in and out the house in the backyard so people were sat everywhere). I took the first bite, and remembered to add some salt as I had been lacking that day. I checked the table where the food was being served and didnt see any salt/pepper, only condiments like ketchup, bbq sauce etc. So I asked the wife/mother where the salt was and she looked a bit taken aback, and went to the kitchen to get some. Before she handed me the salt, she asked if the food wasnt well salted. I didnt want to explain the blood pressure ordeal so I just said “No it tastes amazing, I especially love …., but lately ive preferred more salt than usual, my mom always pokes fun at me”  FYI my mom doesnt make fun of me, i just tried to joke around and make it lighthearted cuz i didnt wanna offend her. 

She just smiled lightly and said “Oh okay”. Hours later in the car, my father was upset with me cuz apparently the lady told the other older women there, who then told their husbands, where my dad overheard, who told my mom. He heard that I ‘demanded’ more salt cuz the food was too ‘plain’ which i did NOT say. Even after i clarified what I said, he was still mad at me for disrespecting the hosts of the dinner and said I should’ve just eaten the food, and that Ive embarrassed him. My mom was quiet the whole time because she doesn’t like arguing with my father as he’s very stubborn and can get verbally aggressive quickly. I really dont think Ive done anything wrong, but maybe im not seeing it from an ‘adult’ perspective?

109,1gkeg5u,AITA Trying to settle a point,"Okay, so, I really have to put this out there and ask.
My significant other has three children total two with two other women and one with me. His daughter used to come stay every other week with us. Then her mother decided she didn't like that, because she told her mom she wanted to live here full time and not with her mom. Her mother cut her off from being able to even come over just for visits not even staying the night... Resulting in my partner having to go over there to see her or in public places. This is not the problem however, the issue is that we currently had to downsize to a two bedroom instead of a three bedroom. I'm having trouble finding work and we couldn't afford the three-bedroom home. That being said,vhe never gets overnights with his other son just visits during the day but he's okay with that.(Clarifying why his other son didn't have a room to begin with) Due to us downsizing and our son being under the age of three, we gave his daughter the room and had our son staying on our room in his crib for the time being. However, now that his daughter has not been allowed to stay overnights or come over in 3 months,, I told him I think it's only fair we make that room our son's room. He is worried about turning it into our son's room because he's worried about her mother making us look bad for taking her room away even though she's not allowed to be here. This is causing conflicts between him and I and our relationship. I think it's a little ridiculous because his daughter's not even allowed to come over so she's not even going to see that the room is not hers anymore. I told him that once we get back on our feet we would move into a new three-bedroom and it would not matter. He thinks it's necessary to tell her about it and her mother and I think it's unnecessary because it's only going to cause more issues and I don't see a point in making it known to them since neither one of them are going to find out either way.
