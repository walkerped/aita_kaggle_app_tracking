0,1gjxm7m,AITA for calling security on my roommates?,"I (23 N/B) have randomly assigned roommates (Separate bed/bath, shared living). All three are 19yo students (2F, 1M).

They had a loud party that ran past 10:00PM. Our apt. quiet hours from 10PM-7AM. The next morning I found my dishes moved, my food squashed in the fridge, and my washcloth missing.

They share groceries and dishes with each other, but I have a firm ""don't touch my stuff"" line that they all agreed to. I moved all my stuff to my bedroom.

That morning, I explained when quiet-hours are and shared the number for security. My roommates said it was dramatic moving my stuff, that I should've expected the party to be loud, and that we need to accommodate each other's lifestyles.

A week later, someone stumbles in at 2:00AM, carried by their friends. It woke me up. I asked Beth about it later (fake names), but didn't feel like playing detective.

Another night they were on the patio laughing and talking, the TV blasting, and guests were over, so I called security on them. I was not going to be ignored. My roommates hid in their rooms. After ringing awhile, I answered the door, told him I had called. We got a warning email.

My roommates heard me admit to calling security on the doorbell camera. Five paragraphs were sent between them calling me dramatic, saying they had had to accommodate me and I should do the same. I told them that the rules were in the lease they signed. If there’s a problem with the rules, talk to the manager. Eight paragraphs after that. They ask if I’m planning to renew my lease next year, and offer to pay the fee if I want to move out early.

What we landed on later was I’d text the group first when they were loud.

So it happened again and I texted them. Conner responds that I ""could have gotten up and said something"". Anna said she knew I’d been up cause my light was on.

Yet another quiet-hours violation, and I texted the group that I would be going straight to security next time. As it was, I was still getting woken up at 2AM with no consequences. In my book, you only get to plead incompetence so many times.

Last week the apt. manager asked to schedule a meeting to ""go over updates"" and ""see how things are going"". Translation: ""they want to kick me out, let’s do an intervention then assess"" I had asked about it years ago, but never went forward.

Ann pushed us to schedule the meeting. I said it sounded like a waste of time so I'd skip it. 

Ann called me crazy for threatening to call security, that they weren't being that loud and they weren’t gonna tiptoe around their own apt.

Ann now claims the meeting is mandatory. I’ve scoured the lease and think she might be lying. I told her that if she’s not loud I won't call security, and they won't get fined regardless. She wants to talk about it more, but I’m not interested in sitting and being called crazy. I’m non-binary, I get plenty of that as is.

I can see that I'm being a bit of a stickler, and I hate doing that. I just can't stand working on four hours of sleep.

1,1gke8ac,AITA for setting boundaries on  thanksgiving dinner,"
All right, so this is my first post. I just wanna know if I’m the ahole for not wanting to go to a restaurant with my whole family. For context, I was told two months ago, that myself, my mother, my stepfather, my stepsister and her two children seven and two and possibly my cousin will be going to a restaurant for Thanksgiving. So today I was just told by my mother that my stepsister‘s mother who is raising my stepsister’s seven-year-old will be joining. Now there’s long history in short she’s a narcissist and had caused my stepsister to develop Borderline Personality disorder. The issue I have is since I turned 18 one year after the seven-year-old was born. I had made a clear boundary that I do not want to go to social settings that include my step sister‘s mother which my mother agreed is perfectly fine now for Thanksgiving She is telling me that I need to be an adult and put aside my boundaries of not wanting to be involved with my stepsister‘s mother because it is also the seven-year-old‘s birthday now I had explained to her that I will make it still a happy day and a happy occasion And we’ll celebrate before the dinner and they can go to dinner and when they come back, everyone can tell me how it was, and I will still be happy and polite. For context to that when I am around my stepsister‘s mother, I am miserable doesn’t matter if she’s being polite it doesn’t matter if she’s being rude. I am just miserable in her presence and I tend to make other people miserable while I’m in her presence.

2,1gke1wz,AITA for interrupting husbands “free time” because I’m sick?,"I (24f) am pregnant with my second child. My husband (25m) wasn’t the most understanding of pregnancy last time and basically thought I was being “dramatic” till I started showing at which point he was very supportive. This seems to be happening again. 

He has been helping out with our toddler a lot at night and I’m suppose to then take toddler when he’s up at 6am to let husband sleep in. This has happened with varying success because toddler is loud. 

Last night husband went to bed at 9:30pm last night and toddler slept till 4:45am when my husband got up to settle him and then husband went back to sleep till around 7:45. 

Tensions were already running high because husband continued to be “off the clock” but stayed in the dining room. This meant toddler was running up to dad every 30 seconds. I was trying to make everyone food but was repeatedly being called over to distract my toddler away from my husband. I finally told him if he wanted to have free time he needed to go into the bedroom and shut the door. He did so after some grumbling that he should be allowed to enjoy time wherever he wants in his home. But seemed like he was fine after I brought him breakfast in bed. 

I continued to clean and take care of toddler while getting sicker and sicker. I had to interrupt husband for a minute to watch toddler while I puked. Then he went back to the room when I was done. At 9:45 am I had to interrupt him again cause I was sick. 

At this point husband was very upset. He says I shouldn’t be “offering” him free time and then interrupting him repeatedly. I feel I really did try my best to give him free time but can’t control when I’m sick. I’ve tried to just bring toddler with me but he will just open the door and run away while I’m puking.

4,1gkd8ef,"AITA for missing another ""big moment"" for my half siblings?","My dad is so inconsistent about being in my life. He and my mom divorced when I was 1 but he bailed days after I was born, came back when I was 8 months old and my mom let him stay a month before realizing he wasn't serious about being a family with us and just used her for a place to stay. Once he realized she wasn't going to give in he bailed again. He was in my life for a year when I was 3-4 years old. Then he was gone again. The next time I was 8. He was in my life for a few months under supervision but he left again and he made 2 appearances when I was 10. He didn't really pay child support either, which I learned this summer. Some money was given for me but probably less than $400 in the last 16 years if what he said is right.

When I was 13 he moved here for good, or so he says. He was married again and he had some kids with his wife. He went back to restart visitation with me, got some supervised visits again that became one overnight a month. Until finally I have to spend every other weekend at his house even though I don't want to. And I did speak to a judge about my wishes but he told me it was in my best interest to have a relationship with ""my family"" 

I really don't like being there and I try to only sleep in the bed I have at his house. I never take anything I care about and I don't have the room personalized or anything.

The thing about all this is my dad and his wife encourage their kids to spend time with me and engage with me. They like having me there and they told me before they wish I'd spend more time there and with them. The kids did nothing wrong but I don't want to focus on a relationship with them. I feel nothing for them. But it's expected that I'd be there for the big moments in their lives. Not just by their parents but my dad's parents, who I don't know outside of some of the time I spent with him, also feel like I need to be a good brother and they expect me to take the role seriously. Which I find crazy since I don't know any of these people all that much and I don't want to. If it's not my dad's weekends, I do miss the big stuff and I don't try to be there for them.

I got invited to go trick or treating with them on Halloween. I said no. I got a reply back that they really wanted me to come. I didn't, and I got sent so many texts from my dad's phone and phones that I assume are his wife's and his parents claiming I'm shitty for missing another big moment for my half siblings.

6,1gkco7b,WIBTA if I take my boyfriend's money?,"I (f18) am a first year college student. I'm a commuter and I love about 30 minutes away from my college. I make basically first for money and can barely afford to get to my college each week and feed myself, actually I basically can't afford and it if it weren't for my boyfriend (m18) I would not be able to eat every week. Right now I don't have time for another job and I can't get more hours at my current workplace due to my busy schedule.

On the other hand my boyfriend isn't going to college and doesn't have a car, instead he has a full time job, no bills, and plays video games when hes not at work or with me. His mom and neighbor drive him to and from work every day and he makes more than 4 times what I make weekly. He works hard and is very good at his job so obviously he deserves what he makes.

Before I started college the rolls were reversed, I had job that I worked 20-30 hrs a week at and made about half of what he's making now but he had no job at all. I was mainly stuck to paying for all of our activities and still could barely afford it but we made it work.

Now that I'm in college and our dynamic has swapped he pays for relatively all of our activity expenses, and even sometimes covers my gas for the trips we make. I am beyond grateful at how much he pays for and I have no idea how to make it up to him but I'm often left feeling like I'm just a money pit for him. 

On top of all of that he insists almost daily on giving me money for the week, though I have never accepted it. He claims that the only reason he got a job in the first place was to save up for a car and spend his money on me since he couldn't when we first started dating but I feel like I cannot in good conscience take his money for my own benefit. Its not that I have an ego issue with taking other people's help but I understand the value of money in today's economy and I genuinely feel wrong for accepting his handouts. I know in reality that if he did give me money it likely wouldn't harm him financially but it still just feels wrong.

Sometimes when I think about how financially screwed I am at the moment I consider accepting his offer but there's a small part of me that just feels wrong about the whole ordeal. 

I guess I just need a fresh perspective from people on the outside of my current predicament. Would I be the asshole if I ended up accepting his offers? Is it greedy? I feel like he's already paying for enough things

7,1gkcl41,AITA For Suggesting to Cancel Xmas So My Future Sister-in-Law Can Focus on Her Wedding?,"My BIL is getting married this December. His fiancé pretty much does not share anything about the details of the wedding to the family. She canceled the ceremony without talking to us and just decided to have an intimate ceremony at their church with just an immediate family and will just have a reception in December with the extended family. When the family keeps asking what the plan was and if there is anything we could do to help, she would just respond, we got it, just attend. But over the weekend my MIL kept pushing to get more details since we are not getting any respond from her, I suggested we can cancel xmas so it is one thing to worry about. My future SIL responded. “Please do not use my wedding as a reason to cancel xmas”.

I was shocked and honestly, hurt. My MIL came over the weekend and I shared my feelings. I shared that it makes me uncomfortable now going to the family events with my future SIL there and maybe will not go at all.

Apparently, this was relayed to my future SIL by my MIL. My MIL just want to make sure that everything is okay with future SIL. Future SIL messaged me and my husband with the screenshot of my MIL’s message. She said she has no idea that it was an issue. She was just being honest of what she said, and did not appreciate that we are bringing drama to her on a Monday morning.

8,1gkckxf,AITA for planning a Disney trip without my stepdaughter and leaving her with her father,"I (41F) and my husband (41M) have four children. I have one child from a previous relationship, he has two, and we have one together. 

We have always treated the children as equally as possible, though with extended family, they don't always go on the same trips if we don't go. Ex: his parents take his children on vacations and my child doesn't want to go without me. This has never been an issue. But when we plan trips, we always take everyone. 

The problem is that my SD (16 f) doesn't really like anything that anyone else does. Or she will like it until someone else does. Ex: she really wanted to go on a winter trip to Colorado for skiing. None of the other children were that excited, but seeing as it's hard to find things she likes, we went. She was excited until the other kids started enjoying it too, then she wanted to leave. This is pretty much what happens when we went on trips to the zoo, museums, anything. And if other people are already happy about it, she immediately hates the idea.

We thought maybe she just wanted time with each parent alone. So we did that with both her mom and dad. She still complained the whole time. Her counselor said maybe she wants activities with both parents to show they get along. They did that but if they show any enjoyment at all, she hates whatever they are doing. We've done girl days with her mom and I and she hates it. We have found the less enthusiastic we are, the more she wants to do it. 

This applies to meals too. If someone else likes something, she finds ways to criticize it. It's like she can't let anyone else enjoy anything. She also likes things more if no one else wants to do them. This also happens when she goes with her aunt and cousins. Her sister is not like this at all. We've asked her if she has any insight (their mother has too) and she comes up with nothing other than, ""She's just a b***h"" and shrugs. 

We let her choose other day trips, told her she can bring her friend, but it's the same. If she sees someone like something she chose, she complains and says it was her idea like no one else can enjoy it.

So this year, we had been talking about Disney for a while. My nephew has cancer and has always wanted to go with us because he has no siblings and not many friends because he's missed a lot of school. SD said it was stupid as soon as everyone else wanted to go. Her father said he would have a lot of work to catch up on when he got back. He does seasonal work and has to take the work while he can. The kids agreed that they wanted to go and he wanted us to, so I made the plans and we decided to go back another year with all of us. 

I made the reservations for myself, sister, nephew, and 3 of our children, deciding SD can stay back with dad since she didn't want to go anyway.

My husband says ITA for not planning for her to come too but I don't want her ruining the trip with complaints with my nephew there. Aita?

Edit: To clarify, I asked SD multiple times if she wanted to go as I planned, so I would know at each stage if she had changed her mind. She was adamant every time she didn't want to go. Her dad says she always says she doesn't want to go but would regret missing out. This is based on last summer's vacation when she said she didnt want to go but loved it. We were at a campground and it rained the whole time. We were pretty miserable but she thought it was funny.

When we were younger it was over stuff that she believed I could do that she couldn't. But there was nothing. She'd say I got to do more extra curricular's than her but we each had one. I was in a music class after school for 5 years and she did dance. My classes had more breaks than hers did but we still only had one each. She'd get SO mad at me for having more and sometimes when I'd get back from class when she was on break I'd come home to her dumping all my stuff all over the room. One time she threw stuff from the top of the stairs when dad and I were coming in the door and she broke a lot of toys.

I was jealous that mom and dad bought her more stuff at Christmas when we were younger. At the time I thought they loved her more but the stuff all added up to the same amount. I got less because my individual gifts cost more. But when my sister was mean I'd argue that she got more than me. She'd still say I still got to do more stuff and it wasn't fair.

When I was 10 she broke my guitar because she still believed I did more extra curricular's. My parents couldn't afford to replace it back then and I decided to quit music lessons because I didn't like other instruments as much, except piano but that was more expensive to learn and we never owned a piano so practice was impossible. I hated her so much for it but she would act so smug about it. She rubbed it in my face for years. When I got angry enough I'd tell her I wish she wasn't my sister and I hated her. She'd say same.

I started my period when I was 11 and I have endometriosis, only diagnosed this year, which causes me issues. I bleed a lot and have so much pain. My sister started calling me gross and would tell people at school about how gross I am and she'd tell people about bleeding accidents I had.

13,1gkbs7m,AITA for forbidding a friend of mine to stream my DnD game to Twitch?,"Oh boy, this headline needs a lot of context.

I wanted to make a DnD campaign for my closest friends and had finished all my preparations. We set a date for the first session; everyone was pretty hyped up, and I was excited as well. The day we were supposed to start, a friend—let’s call her Lisa (girlfriend of one of my closer friends, let’s call him Fabien)—asked if it would be cool to livestream the session on Twitch. Some of us were reluctant, wanting to “groove in” with each other for the first session without an audience, myself included.

She argued that her viewers would miss the lore if we skipped streaming the first session and that the story wouldn’t make sense without it (for context, her Twitch channel has at most 10 viewers). After some back and forth, she said, “Either we stream the first session, or we don’t.” I replied, “Then we don’t.”

Once the group gathered on Discord, everyone was excited but noticed that Fabien and Lisa were delaying. After 20 minutes, Fabien joined, clearly upset, saying we’d hurt Lisa’s feelings. Apparently, she was sobbing and couldn’t speak, so he spoke on her behalf. He launched into a tirade, especially targeting me for “talking down” to her so harshly.

A female friend of mine, who was pregnant at the time, and another female friend defended me, going through our chat history and pointing out that none of us had said anything problematic. Fabien countered that our tone was “harsh,” while we felt Lisa was reading too much into our texts.

Fabien and Lisa decided not to join, so we played the first session without them, though the group was a bit tense. Afterward, the discussion reignited in chat rooms and private messages. The two girls and I discussed how to proceed, as Fabien and Lisa wanted nothing to do with them after “how harshly, dismissively, and angrily” they felt we’d spoken.

I tried to mediate, but eventually, I wanted to get it over with and encouraged both sides to speak directly to each other. This only escalated things, especially when a comment was made about the pregnant friend’s baby that went way too far. I do recognize I was on one side of the conflict, and Fabien and Lisa criticized my wording and bias. The conflict eventually made me cry in front of my colleagues at work.

The fallout was swift: the DnD round was canceled, and my friend circle split in two—but sadly, this isn’t the end.

My best friend, let’s call him Zack, met with both sides separately and heard out their perspectives. He concluded that both sides had made mistakes and tried to encourage them to apologize, but neither was willing to compromise or see the other’s point of view.

Now Zack and I both want to stay friends with everyone, but each side resents that. In Lisa's view, I’m no longer a friend due to my treatment of her and for being friends with both girls. Meanwhile, they are upset with me for wanting to stay friends with someone who treated them so badly. For now, this is the status quo.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-05,"AITA for forbidding a friend of mine to stream my DnD game to Twitch? Oh boy, this headline needs a lot of context.

I wanted to make a DnD campaign for my closest friends and had finished all my preparations. We set a date for the first session; everyone was pretty hyped up, and I was excited as well. The day we were supposed to start, a friend—let’s call her Lisa (girlfriend of one of my closer friends, let’s call him Fabien)—asked if it would be cool to livestream the session on Twitch. Some of us were reluctant, wanting to “groove in” with each other for the first session without an audience, myself included.

She argued that her viewers would miss the lore if we skipped streaming the first session and that the story wouldn’t make sense without it (for context, her Twitch channel has at most 10 viewers). After some back and forth, she said, “Either we stream the first session, or we don’t.” I replied, “Then we don’t.”

Once the group gathered on Discord, everyone was excited but noticed that Fabien and Lisa were delaying. After 20 minutes, Fabien joined, clearly upset, saying we’d hurt Lisa’s feelings. Apparently, she was sobbing and couldn’t speak, so he spoke on her behalf. He launched into a tirade, especially targeting me for “talking down” to her so harshly.

A female friend of mine, who was pregnant at the time, and another female friend defended me, going through our chat history and pointing out that none of us had said anything problematic. Fabien countered that our tone was “harsh,” while we felt Lisa was reading too much into our texts.

Fabien and Lisa decided not to join, so we played the first session without them, though the group was a bit tense. Afterward, the discussion reignited in chat rooms and private messages. The two girls and I discussed how to proceed, as Fabien and Lisa wanted nothing to do with them after “how harshly, dismissively, and angrily” they felt we’d spoken.

I tried to mediate, but eventually, I wanted to get it over with and encouraged both sides to speak directly to each other. This only escalated things, especially when a comment was made about the pregnant friend’s baby that went way too far. I do recognize I was on one side of the conflict, and Fabien and Lisa criticized my wording and bias. The conflict eventually made me cry in front of my colleagues at work.

I have 0 problem paying for food after he has paid for the previous meal but he doesn’t even let me offer and imposes a sort of avoidable situation at me as to why he can’t pay for the particular meal and i have to pay for it.

then after 3 hours, he said “babe you’ll have to order food today, i’m out of energy”, i expected that from a mile away. and he was fully expecting me to pay for his $30 each burger when he came up with that lame excuse. to test that theory out, i said “im tired too, not in the mood to eat”. lie. right after i said that, he was literally not the same person anymore. he was full of energy and even told me to stay awake, “the night has just started”.

This didn’t go over well with a couple of friends. They feel that splitting everything equally is just “what friends do” and that it’s awkward if I go off to do my own thing for cheaper options while they stick to the pricier plans. One friend even said that if I’m not willing to split everything evenly, I should reconsider going on the trip.

18,1gkbdgo,AITA For leaving my family behind to restart,"Just as the title says. My names Drizz, I'm 23 and I just left my family (mom (48) , brother (25) , sister (18)) to basically fend for themselves as I want to restart and do new due to too much conflicting points internally and within the family. 

So In 2022 I decided move to MN from where we were in FL. When I did that, I left my brother, sister, and mom alone and they were ok when I left. Perfectly fine financially and mentally. I decide to visit them in  early 2023 and when I get to them, the house is in shambles from a mental standpoint. 

They were at the point of getting evicted, no one had a job, etc. When I seen this I decided to stay and try and rebuild the family up cause yk... family. 

When I decided to do this, my older brother wasn't living with my mom nor sister. He has a fiance and 2 kids with her, so he went and moved in with her. Seeing that, I got a 2 bedroom apartment. One room for me, a bedroom for my mom and sister as its the most I could afford and the quickest thing I found

We move in October 2023 and from that point all the way until Nov 1st 2024 I pay the rent and most heavy bills. All the family has to worry about is the phone, car insurance, and groceries which comes down to less than 600$ a month while im stuck paying 2400$+ a month in bills.

I generally didn't care about this because it felt good to help the family, but a month or two after moving in , I start hearing my family say I should do more and become more of a man to help more. At first, I shrug it off because I'm a pretty stone made heart dude and don't get fazed by others easily. 

As the months move on and we enter July 2024, I'm all excited for My birthday which was July 10th. Not a single cake, not a gift (not that I care for one but yk a pair socks could of showed me they cared), nothing. Instead I'm told my GF took me out for dinner too long and they don't have time to wait for me, which wouldn't make sense as they didn't even buy me a cake/cupcake/whatever

Thats when I mentally started taking a bad route realizing that my family was just using me it felt like and no matter what I did it wasnt enough. My brother then moves in with us in August 2024 and he is complete hell. He argues that I bring too many different girls to the house (All friends + I pay the rent while he never even have a dollar up for a water bottle) , that I'm disrespectful, lazy, etc.

Want to know what the family did to deal with my brother? Nothing, they told me he had a point and that I should listen to him. A man with no job, no degree, 3 kids, no home. 

So from August 2024 till Nov 2024 my mental really got crushed and I could feel myself beating itself up. I started doubting my looks, my choicez, just everything. 

So, Nov 1st 2024 came around, bought a last min plane ticket to NY, left behind my Computer, 2 laptops, all my consoles, 95% of my shoes (rip to my all my jordan 4's) , No money , no nothing cause I really couldn't stand being there a second longer

20,1gkadq3,AITA for setting a deadline for completing a job,"My son (20M) decided to do a major cleaning of his room.  This involved moving everything but furniture out of the room.

He started last Monday, asked if he could unload his room into the living room, which was OK.  I assumed this would take 1-2 days, he doesn't work or go to school.  By Wednesday, he was still unloading rather than taking things back up.  He said he'd be done by Halloween.

He wasn't done by then, assured us he'd be finished by the time we returned from a weekend trip.  We returned Sunday evening, very little progress, at this point I was getting frustrated as our living room was still filled.  I didn't express this to him, rather to my wife.  She assured me he was making progress, almost done cleaning, was slowly starting to take things back up.

Got home from work last evening, only a few things were moved (~ 1/4 of it).  His room is not large (the house is only 1,200 sq. ft.).  I wasn't happy, took the dog on a walk and texted my wife that I was setting a deadline of today, 11/5.  When I returned, he was eating and talking to friends on the phone.  I got his attention, he muted the call and I told him I expected the living room to be cleared out by Tuesday.  I acknowledged he was doing a big job, but it had been a week and was time to get finished.  I didn't yell, raise my voice, use bad language.  I was as reasonable in tone as possible.

He said ""OK, I'll get it done"" and went upstairs.  My wife got home noticeably unhappy.  Said she would have preferred to speak to him first as it's overwhelming for him.

This morning she came up from downstairs visibly upset.  My son spent the night after we went to bed carting everything  to his room and dumping it wherever there was space.  He told her he now feels uncomfortable living there and wants to get out as soon as possible, she is upset that I ""rushed him"".  I said that I felt a couple days was all that was needed, he's home all day; a week should have been more than enough time.

Possible contributing issues:

1.  My wife and son moved in about 3 1/2 years ago; she had previously lived with him alone (her ex-husband kicked her out when my son was less than a year old).
2.  He had a significant illness that left him with minor brain damage when he was 13.  He has significant social anxiety, this made the transition to adulthood difficult.  He graduated high school online after significant bullying in high school, was an honor student, but has the social anxiety and a (as his mother describes it) ""fear of the world"".
3.  Part of that fear is his gender; he's transgender (FtM), we live in a very ""red state"" in the Southern US.  That was the source of the bullying in high school, also why he's not on speaking terms with his biological father.  I'm his stepfather, though he's considered me his father since I married his mother.  He also overheard his biological father hatefully reject him due to his being transgender.

I said that I felt a couple days was all that was needed, he's home all day; a week should have been more than enough time.

Possible contributing issues:

1.  My wife and son moved in about 3 1/2 years ago; she had previously lived with him alone (her ex-husband kicked her out when my son was less than a year old).
2.  He had a significant illness that left him with minor brain damage when he was 13.  He has significant social anxiety, this made the transition to adulthood difficult.  He graduated high school online after significant bullying in high school, was an honor student, but has the social anxiety and a (as his mother describes it) ""fear of the world"".
3.  Part of that fear is his gender; he's transgender (FtM), we live in a very ""red state"" in the Southern US.  That was the source of the bullying in high school, also why he's not on speaking terms with his biological father.  I'm his stepfather, though he's considered me his father since I married his mother.  He also overheard his biological father hatefully reject him due to his being transgender.

we were adjusting some equipment Z was watching thru a microscope. Out of nowhere she snapped at us saying “Gosh get up & do the work. Just do it yourselves if you know so much C’mon, get up & do it!” We were completely taken aback I responded by “Fine I’ll do it” thinking it would diffuse the tension.
Afterward I tried to brush it off & talked to her normally. She then apologized saying she didn’t mean to snap/was just annoyed cuz she felt she wasn’t contributing enough I told her I understood/it’s okay we’re friends but requested not snap at me again & tell us instead so we can work things. as I really dislike when ppl get aggressive
Instead of accepting my request Z got even angrier claiming I was mad at her. She left & walked away even tho I called after her & walked over telling her we’re friends we shouldn’t act like that then she said she didn’t want to work with me anymore. I was confused since I had only meant to communicate how I felt
*btw She even talked to me about X when we were alone saying she didn’t like how she took things out of her hand while she was trying to work. I told her yea but talk to her why did u snap at me, she got even angrier when I told her not to do it again. She even mentioned u don’t know me I got anger issues. I told her u don’t know me as well & I hate when ppl be aggressive when I didn’t do anything wrong.
next day I found out from X that Z had been talking about the incident behind my back making me look like the bad person. Z even mentioned she didn’t want to work with me which left me feeling hurt/bewildered
I tried to say hi to Z later, she brushed me off saying she needed to leave. I’ve also been told by X that Z expressed frustration over my remarks for wanting to finish our work early instead of taking vids during our experiments. I never meant to offend her I just have time constraints bcuz my brother waits for me after we finish & i was late
I feel like I haven’t done anything wrong & have been respectful thruout our friendship. I’m tired of this drama especially when I genuinely want to be friends with Z. I even considered buying her coffee as a peace offering but I’m unsure if I should even bother since she’s the one snapped first then made everythin into big deal
My other friends said I try again & apologize to Z, but I feel I’ve already done my part by expressing how her behavior upset me. I’m starting to think that stepping back might be best option since I’ve tried to resolve this. Cuz yk I don’t wanna disrespect myself. idk man
am I bad here for standing up for myself or did I handle it wrong?

24,1gk8p3d,AITA for not inviting all my friend group to friendsgiving this year?,"So I (27F) am from a european country but I've always loved the idea of friendsgiving and that's why I've been hosting one every year the last Saturday of November for the last 5 years. I used to do it at my ex bf's house (lest call him Dave) because it's more spacious than my appartment. 

Beginign of last year (2023) me and Dave broke up and a couple months latter he started dating another girl in our friend group (lets call her Sarah). Fast foward to october 24th 2023 (a day before I'm supposed to sent my invites. For context, I always send digital invites exctly a month in avance just to make sure everyone saves the date) we all recieve a messages for a friendsgiving dinner at Dave and Sarah's on the last Saturday of November. I called him to ask if it was a joke, and he replied to me that he wanted to continue hosting friendsgiving. Mind you the idea was always mine and I was the one doing all the work every year, so it never occured to me that he would want to make it. I asked him if he could do his dinner another weekend since friendsgiving was kind of my thing, not only that, but also on that specific date. He told me no, and try to gaslight me into thinking that we always had work on it 50/50 so it was as much a thing of mine as it was his. I spoke with my sister and decided to send my invites the next day and continue with everything as planned. This caused a bit of tension in my friend group, I never wanted to start any trouble so I just comented my point of view on the matter with those who asked me. Some of my friends sided with me and ended up coming to my dinner, but others said that I was beging childish about it and that I should let Dave and Sarah made that years dinner. Because of that  some of my friends ended up dropping and I invited some of my sister's friends that I've also known for a long time, and it turned out being the best friendsgiving I've ever hosted.

Fastfoward to october 28th of this year Dave and Shara have send a messages saying they are doing a friendsgiving dinner at their house on, you guessed it, the last Saturday of November. I've replay saying I already made plans and on the 29th I sent my invites, this time only to the people that came last year to my dinner. So this last couple of days I've been recieving messages from the rest of the friend group that I haven't invited asking why they havent recieve one. I've explain to them that my appartment doesnt have space to host more people that the ones I did last year (which is true) and since they preferred to go to Dave and Shara's last year I assumed this year would be the same. Also I would love to have only last year's people since 1. they where the ones who show me me that are true friends of mine (which is kind of the point of friendsgiving) and 2. it was one of those rare ocassions where you introduce two different groups of people and everyone clicks instantly.

So AITA for not inviting everyone?



P.S. Sorry if there are any grammatical or vocabulary mistakes, English is not my first language.

Edit: Me and Dave have very difference styles when it comes to hosting. I like to be a bit over the top and have everything ready for when people arrive whereas he is more of the type of person that will let us gather at his house but everyone has to contribute and help.

After this she would continue to try and reach out to me and I didn’t respond would try to reach out to my family. I didn’t respond because I felt like I didn’t owe her that and I ended the friendship because I didn’t want her in my life anymore. This was 3 years ago that I ended the friendships.

When I ended the friendship we had not spoken to each other for months because the last few and the last few years we had just been fighting a lot and I think both of us were just disappointed in each other. My friend finally reached out and wanted to fix it and I told her no that I was done. 
After this she would continue to try and reach out to me and I didn’t respond would try to reach out to my family. I didn’t respond because I felt like I didn’t owe her that and I ended the friendship because I didn’t want her in my life anymore. This was 3 years ago that I ended the friendships. 
I recently saw her at a festival and I just kept walking I didn’t want to say hi or anything because I feel like that would be more awkward. She made a loud comment about how I just ignored her and was clearly upset. AMITA for not saying anything? ",0.0,1.0032716989517212,1,0

Akira has hated me for the past year, and will do anything to ruin my life. There was once a time i considered her one of my closest friends, but now we're strangers.

Akira's boyfriend was one of my good friends. We used to talk a lot, being in the same class, and casually interacted, as FRIENDS. (BTW, i had no romantic intentions for this guy, it was purely platonic)

Today, Akira dm'd me on social, and started cussing me out. She accused me of flirting with her bf, and trying to steal her man. (this wasn't the first time it happened. She msged me before this and told me to stay away, so I DID)

She accused me of looking at her bf in a weird way. Mind you, i barely acknowledge his presence. (her exact words were, ""I know he looks good, but he's mine"")

As this was the second time i was accused of smth i didn't do, i was fuming. i refused to accept the blame, and told her that she was in the wrong.

Around this same time my father started his health decline. Throughout this period both my familial and partner relationships were very rough as I was trying to balance being a partner, being a daughter, working, and going to school. Admittedly I fell short in all of these areas except maybe working as I was able to afford school. But it left a sore spot in the hearts of my family as I “checked out” when my dad got sick.

I just graduated college and plan on moving in with my significant other. I brought it up with my parents since I was already feeling uneasy as I’ve never felt like moving away until I met my partner. Additionally I already felt bad for having this desire even without the addition of my dad being sick but that just made it more gut wrenching. 

They have never really liked my partner since that initial rough patch but we made it work as much as it needed to whenever we had gatherings. So when I brought wanting to move in with him, they were taken aback. Mentioning how I have awful judgment, I am an awful daughter, the list goes on. I have now been essentially cut off right before the holidays. The sort of verbal attacks I received as backlash put me on the defensive even though I know there is still some fault I need to take for not helping all I could have, or wanting to move out during these times.

I, 22M, was talking to my aunt on the phone. She badmouthed my friend, essentially calling him a shitty, untrustworthy person and saying that she thinks he wants to rap3 me. Why? Because he told me that two of the people that we used to work with at Wendy’s were saying horrible things about me behind my back. They called me the r-word and one said to the other, “We should intentionally bully Taylor into quitting.” The other one’s face lit up when she said that. She was like, “Why would he say something knowing it would hurt your feelings? How shitty! He knew that you working there was going to be a past chapter in your life.

The problem? She told me that my late mom had a drug addiction with very specific details to follow, including asking around the family for pain medicine and, when they stopped giving it to her, money to buy it. My grandmother was the first person to say something about this, and she was having early onset dementia, so I thought I’d ask my aunt for clarification, and that’s when she said all of that and more.

37,1gk37vt,AITAH for telling my boyfriend he needs hobbies ,"Note this is a throwaway account and I have asked my friends about this but I need a unbiased opinion
I 18F am dating a 18M we have been together for almost a year now. I met him through some mutual friends who I don't talk to anymore. When I first met him I got the impression that he was some mysterious shy nerd. I was very wrong he is shy but not at all a nerd I didn't mind this at all as he was very funny and kind to me. We got together after just a short time of knowing each other. I was so excited to get to know him and all his interests and quirks however that was it. He had none, no hobbies, no sports he liked, no art nothing. He enjoyed nothing. I thought maybe he was just being shy but after knowing him for a year he still hasn't told me anything he enjoys. One night I decided to ask him directly why/ how he had no hobbies. He just said that nothing gave him joy in life other than me, while this was sweet it is also terrifying. I shouldn't be his only source of joy, what if we get in a fight and I hurt his feelings. I don't even want to imagine what he would do if we broke up. So I decided to tell him to get a hobbie I even suggested a few that we could try together. He said their was no point in trying as he would hate it. I'm worried about him, I can't bare the whole of his emotions its to much on top of what I'm dealing with. I get it we are both young and figuring things out, but this can't be normal right? He got quite mad at my suggestion and said I was calling him boring and saying that his life had no purpose. I would like to add that I am very busy with lots of hobbies and work and barely get to see him. When I'm not seeing him all he does is sit on his computer watching YouTube. Am I the asshole? 

Edit: after reading all the comments I am so grateful to have posted. You where right. I spoke to him and unprovoked he told me that he had been struggling with mental health and it had gotten worse recently. What I thought was him withdrawing from me and his friends was actually him struggling. He said that he had decided to go to a doctor to get diagnosed with anxiety officially and maybe get on some meds for it. I can't believe I missed the signs earlier on in our relationship. we had discussed our past struggles with depression and how we had got through it. His experience was much more recant than mine. After more talking he agreed that finding little joy in his life was not normal and he agreed to see some one about it. Reading everyone's comments made things a lot clearer to me, he is unable to find stuff he enjoys because he is struggling with mental health. I feel shit for missing this, I always knew that he had bad anxiety and encouraged him to seak therapy but didn't realise how bad it actually was. I so happy that he has come to the conclusion of needing therapy himself as it save me a really difficult conversation. I told him that i wanted to help and support him in anyway I could that if he needed something to tell me. Things are looking really good. 
Thanks so much for your help I'm really hoping that he goes through with it and that therapy will help and allow him to find joy in life.

He had none, no hobbies, no sports he liked, no art nothing. He enjoyed nothing. I thought maybe he was just being shy but after knowing him for a year he still hasn't told me anything he enjoys. One night I decided to ask him directly why/ how he had no hobbies. He just said that nothing gave him joy in life other than me, while this was sweet it is also terrifying. I shouldn't be his only source of joy, what if we get in a fight and I hurt his feelings. I don't even want to imagine what he would do if we broke up. So I decided to tell him to get a hobbie I even suggested a few that we could try together. He said their was no point in trying as he would hate it. I'm worried about him, I can't bare the whole of his emotions its to much on top of what I'm dealing with. I get it we are both young and figuring things out, but this can't be normal right? He got quite mad at my suggestion and said I was calling him boring and saying that his life had no purpose. I would like to add that I am very busy with lots of hobbies and work and barely get to see him. When I'm not seeing him all he does is sit on his computer watching YouTube. Am I the asshole? 

Edit: after reading all the comments I am so grateful to have posted. You where right. I spoke to him and unprovoked he told me that he had been struggling with mental health and it had gotten worse recently. What I thought was him withdrawing from me and his friends was actually him struggling. He said that he had decided to go to a doctor to get diagnosed with anxiety officially and maybe get on some meds for it. I can't believe I missed the signs earlier on in our relationship. we had discussed our past struggles with depression and how we had got through it. His experience was much more recant than mine. After more talking he agreed that finding little joy in his life was not normal and he agreed to see some one about it. Reading everyone's comments made things a lot clearer to me, he is unable to find stuff he enjoys because he is struggling with mental health. I feel shit for missing this, I always knew that he had bad anxiety and encouraged him to seak therapy but didn't realise how bad it actually was. I so happy that he has come to the conclusion of needing therapy himself as it save me a really difficult conversation. I told him that i wanted to help and support him in anyway I could that if he needed something to tell me. Things are looking really good. 
Thanks so much for your help I'm really hoping that he goes through with it and that therapy will help and allow him to find joy in life. ",0.0,1.066107988357544,1,0
38,1gk2uib,WIBTA if i charge for a coverup of a nasty tattoo i did?,"
i'm one year into tattooing, this is the first coverup i do of a tattoo that i did. i tattooed a saying in arabic on a girl's back a few weeks ago and we both tought it translated to ""appreciate life"" because the translation was right under the words in arabic in the photo she sent me. she texted me a few days ago saying that she wants me to delete the pic of her tattoo off of my page because it actually translates to something awful.

i was so shocked, i ran the pic thru translate lens myself like 5 times and the tattoo did, in fact, mean something gross. i usually do check what clients' tattoos mean beforehand when they are in a foreign language, but i did not check this one because the translation came with the refference pic. i quickly deleted the post and told her that i'm happy to work on a coverup together if she's down for it. she was, and i finished the design today. she likes it and we are gonna do it

the thing is, i feel very guilty about this whole thing bc it never happened to me before. i feel really sorry that i put that on someone's body and i am very happy to cover it, but i feel SO ashamed of charging her for this coverup because i somehow feel like it's my fault. i, as the artist, should of checked the translation and i'm afraid that there is a possibility that she tought the coverup was free, so when i tell her a price she will blame me for the tattoo and end up on bad terms. it was her first tattoo and we have a common friend so she may think that i offered my coverup services as an apology, but tbh i don't even know if i did anything wrong??? maybe i'm overthinking.

i'm so conflicted and idk what to do. on one side i do feel for her and i want to help her, but on the other side this is a complex tattoo that i don't really afford to give out for free. if she was my friend i would totally do it for free but she's a friend's girlfriend's friend, so i don't even know what our status is to be able to give out my resources like that. WIBTA if i charge her for this coverup? IF i do, i will cut it down a lot tho


EDIT: to be more specific:
- i did not make the writing design myself, i just copied the picture she sent me
- the picture she sent me had the design and ""appreciate life"" under it as translation
- i'm calling the tattoo nasty bc it is. it actually translates to ""i'm rotten""
- after further research i found that the pic she sent me circulated on tumblr a few years ago as a meme but we obviously were not aware of that. it's just words on white backround

EDIT 2: i've never had so many ppl comment on my post. i've tried to read everything and i finally made my decision. thank you all for the help, truly! i will update on sunday, when the coverup is scheduled, hopefully being able to answer some questions after meeting with my client again. see you on sunday!",No A-holes here,2024-11-05,"WIBTA if i charge for a coverup of a nasty tattoo i did?

39,1gk2e7k,WIBTA if I tell my friend that she needs to be less clingy and learn to be more independent?,"I am 16M, and my two best friends are my twin sister, who is 16F (who I'll call Katie), and our 16F friend (who I'll call Montannah).

Don't get me wrong, Montannah's a sweetheart, but she's just getting incredibly clingy towards me and Katie, and I'm worried about her.

What's playing on my mind is a party we're going to this weekend. It's one of our friends' eighteenth birthday party and Katie and I have both been looking forward to it for weeks. Most of our friends are attending, and we haven't seen a few of them in a while because they attend different schools. We were both looking forward to a night of fun and partying with them all. However, the host of the party messaged Katie last night asking if we were planning to bring Montannah, to which she replied no. So he went and invited her, and now she's coming to the party.

Normally, I'd be more than okay with this, except for the fact that Montannah will only know a few people at the party, and she isn't good with large groups of people. She said she was not enthused about there being a lot of people there, so Katie kindly asked her how she planned to cope with that. Montannah responded that she could just stick with us two. I was already planning to hang out with my other friends since I spend much less time with them than I do with her. I also have very different friendship dynamics with them. I'm  just worried that she's going to cling to either Katie or me the entire time due to her being socially awkward; which she already does regularly. I know if she does do that, I'm well in my right to ask her to give me some space while I'm with my other friends. But at the same time, I'm also afraid of her feeling like I'm abandoning her and getting upset, which has happened before.

An example of this is last year's New Year's Eve celebrations. Katie and I were planning to hang out with Montannah, just the three of us, but she cancelled a few days before. So, Katie and I went and made plans with other people. Then Montannah was suddenly able to come along at the last minute, so she came along with us and the group we'd made plans with. When the group wanted to hang out at one of our friends' houses, she stayed behind because she was getting overwhelmed with the whole situation. Montannah then got quite upset that we weren't spending time with her, which I understand; I get that she wants to spend time with the two of us. But I also wish she was able to accept that she is not the only person that we spend time with and that we won't drop plans with other friends just for her.

I just really want her to be happy, but I also want a social life with other people, which makes me wonderful if I would be the asshole if I expressed how I feel to her.

So, would I be the asshole if I were to tell her that she needs to learn to be less clingy and more independent?

I'm also really sorry if my English is not the best.

Edit: I'm planning on talking to Montannah and making it clear that I have other friends I also want to spend time with. I've decided at the party I'm going to introduce Montannah to my friends so hopefully she can get to know some of them. I've also worked out that if she starts to get clingy I'll try to talk to her kindly about how I need some space and kindly encourage she makes the effort to talk to and get to know others than just Katie and I.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-05,"WIBTA if I tell my friend that she needs to be less clingy and learn to be more independent?

40,1gk1ypf,AITA for moving forward with putting my parents out? ,"

I 35M and my wife 30F and our two children have been living in my parents home (70F &71M) for the past two years. I have paid my mother $400/month including the fact that I help with groceries, do their laundry and sometimes drive them free of charge although they never offer gas to places they need to go. It has been this way since we moved in. They have never helped with anything with my children while we struggled although they are financially well off and asking me to pay rent at all seeing that I have two children to provide for, was selfish on their part.

The past several months, my parents mainly my mother has asked that we all move out without giving us proper notice or help for a deposit since we don't have the best credit and pretty much intended to throw us on the streets. I asked her to give me until at least April of next year and I would for sure figure something out, even if we had to go to settle for a 1 bed. My mother refused, giving us until the end of this month to move out.
She has gone in my room without my permission, taken items that have been gifted to me by my brother (such as Gucci, Neiman Marcus, very expensive things) and taken it from me. At this point I filed a RO against them both which was approved saying that they can't come into my room or they'll be in violation. She has denied taking my things but I know she did.


The police have filed warrants for them both for grand larceny since I filed reports about my stolen items that exceed $900. Once they execute the warrant, I plan to get my RO modified so they can't come into the home at all anymore. Being that my children and I all feel unsafe and she took from us. AITA?

41,1gk1ch4,AITA for refusing to spend Christmas with my family?,"
I (18F) live alone with my 6 month old son. Christmas is always planned early within my family as there is a lot to plan for with a big family, so despite it only being November, we have already began making plans.

For context, when I was 16 I was living with my friend and was told I could not come to my mothers for Christmas as there was not enough space and travel would be hard (although I’m a 10 minute drive away), I was understanding and spent the Holliday with my friend and his mother. The next year, I was finally living in my own house and despite being pregnant with my son, I was greeted with the same excuse, so yet again I spent Christmas with my friend and his mother.

This year, my mum wants me and my son to spend Christmas with her and the rest of the family as it’s his first holiday and she wants to spend the day with him. Normally I’d agree but this year I firmly told her I would rather spent Christmas just myself and my baby. She got upset with me and said he should spend his first Christmas with his family. But I can’t help but not want to, the last two years I’ve felt completely disregarded and unwanted by my family around the holiday and was never invited to spend the day with them, but now that I have a son transport/space suddenly isn’t an issue. It just makes me feel like they only want me around to see my son/if it benefits them. Despite her pleading, my answer has yet to change and my family are telling me I’m an asshole for being petty and isolating my son on the holiday.

I just don’t want to go after the way I was forced to feel for two years. He’s a baby and although I’ll make the day special, he won’t remember it so I really don’t see how it’s going to harm him. My mother and I were never close but she’s been all over me since the birth of my son, constantly wanting to see him and ignoring me, invaliding me and not even checking up on me when she knows I’m struggling with postnatal depression, I can’t help but feel like I’m only loved because I had a baby and I just don’t want to spend the entire day questioning if I’m there because I’m wanted or if it’s just because I’m a mother now.

44,1gk0jit,AITA for yelling at my mom after my brother “ran away”?,"My family is pretty religious and conservative. 

I have my own opinions but I always keep my mouth shut. I just avoid my family for the most part. My brother (20) still lives at home and well… ever since he was a kid he’s always been more out there. 

He’s very open minded and artistic as well, so he’s always pissing off our parents and sisters. He was a really good volleyball player in high school but quit his senior year just to spite our parents so I’m sure you can tell what kind of guy he is. But he’s the only boy so our parents keep “letting it go.” 

Anyways, he recently acted in some silly amateur film for one of his friends. In it, he kisses a boy. I genuinely don’t care. Anyways the film wasn’t a secret and posted publicly, so someone we know came across it and it was sent to our parents who kicked him out. 

My younger sister and her husband offered to take him in but my brother left not even a week later because our BIL was being a dick to him about the film. Now no one knows where he is and everyone’s pissed and angry. I only know he’s alive because he’s texted me a few times. 

Mom calls the whole family over almost every day to play the blame game and yesterday it was my turn and she was basically saying that as the oldest I didn’t do my job and led him astray because I failed as a sister or some crap. I got so angry I told her to shut the hell up and that this is her fault more than it is mine. Doesn’t sound like a huge deal but it’s super disrespectful in our family so everyone was upset with me for yelling at mom and breaking her heart even more after what my brother did. I told them to stop acting like victims and that they’d better pray he decides to see any of us again and left.

I feel better but the entire family is angry at me. Especially now that my brother isn’t around to take their anger. I wish I could run away too but unfortunately I have responsibilities tying me here so I’m wondering if I’m the asshole and if I should apologize… AITA? ",0.0,0.8654274940490723,1,0

46,1gk0dr8,AITA for Not Returning My Mom’s Golden Bracelet?,"(Throwaway account for privacy reasons, with some details changed.)

I (35M) need an outside perspective because this situation is causing me a lot of stress.

For context, I’m the eldest of three siblings – my sister (33F) and my brother (31M).

Five years ago, when I got married, my father gifted my wife and me a pair of gold bracelets that had belonged to my late mother. These bracelets were passed down from my mother’s grandmother, making them deeply sentimental. My mom passed away when I was young, so it felt like a part of her was present at our wedding.

In Chinese culture, it’s traditional to gift gold jewellery to the bride during the tea ceremony at weddings. My wife and I were very touched by this gesture from my father.

Fast forward to the present: my brother is getting married soon, and my father (71M) is now demanding that I return the bracelets. He says he doesn't want to buy new ones and claims he never intended for us to keep them permanently.

I refused, explaining that he never mentioned the bracelets were on loan. If he wanted them back, why gift them to us in the first place? [A red envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope) would have sufficed.

I would understand if my dad said these bracelets were meant to be inherited by my siblings and me, but the only reason he gave is that he doesn’t want to buy new gold jewellery.  
    
I believe this conversation should have happened before gifting the bracelets to my wife and me.

My father is upset with my response and has decided to drag my siblings into this.

He even told my brother that it’s my fault his fiancée won’t be receiving any gold bracelets. When I spoke to my brother, he said he didn’t want to get between me and our dad and that he doesn't really care about the gifts. I feel like he's only saying this to avoid any arguments between him and I.

However, my sister is siding with my father. She privately messaged me, accusing me of valuing money over family. She said, “You can’t consider it a gift if Dad is asking for it back,” and told me to seriously rethink my values. She even compared me to a cousin who had stolen money from the family and ran away.

A part of me wants to return the bracelets just to keep the peace, especially with my siblings. I’m so tired of the stress, the mind games, and the fighting. But a larger part of me is enraged by all of this and doesn’t want to give in at all.

She got really mad about it and told me I made her look stupid for not telling her about the mistake and took advantage of her for doing that, in my mind I was just playing the game I thought it was a funny mistake I didn't though it was a big deal, I would have done the same if it was someone else that was making the mistake and not just her, but she felt I did it to make her look stupid and if it had been someone else I would have pointed the mistake to help them win.

48,1gjzmmh,AITAH for not accepting my sisters new partner even though?,"Recently my dad passed away. My sister brought her new partner of two months (who none of us had met) to the house to say goodbye to my dad in his last days. Her partner ( would not leave her side or give any of us time alone with her to grieve or talk. For perspective- I didnt even bring my husband of four year with whom I share two kids to say goodbye to my dad because we all wanted it to be an intimate and family thing. While my sister and her partner were there at the house while my dad was actively dying they were exhibiting PDA- rubbing each other’s collar bones; cuddling on the couch. My other sister said something about feeling uncomfortable because she just wanted to say goodbye to our dad without feeling like a third wheel in the family living room. My sister and her partner get upset ask her to apologize to them then they left. She’s made it clear to everyone that her partner is a permanent fixture in her life and will be around at every event.

Her partner is much older than her and has some health issues. Her partner complained about struggling financially and my sister makes a very large salary. So when they moved in together I was afraid that her partner would start to control her more because of the financial security my sister brings, her partner was previously in a relationship with a married person which makes me question my sisters judgment because my sister was totally fine with that setup. It makes me hesitant to trust that her partner is being faithful to her. Her partner has family in the area too. 

And her partner goes over to their family’s house without my sister, but my sister can’t seem to go anywhere without her partner. The relationship seems very clingy/codependent. My sister loves to feel needed and to be a caretaker and her partner seems to need to be taken care of. So I guess their relationship works for their personalities and that’s fine. I want her to be happy. 

I have been my sister’s ally since forever. When I was in bad relationships, she was always there for me. She never made me feel bad for making bad decisions in love and was always there for me in the aftermath. So I understand why she might feel hurt by my less than enthusiastic reception to her relationship. I understand that my sister is in a new relationship and feels like it’s them against the world. Everyone wants to feel accepted and to have validation. I feel like I may be harming my relationship with her by not blindly accepting her new relationship and just accepting them with open arms. I would be angry if she told me she didn’t ever want me to bring my husband around. 

I love my sister. I want a relationship with her. She is always welcome to come over or to come join us on family outings, but I don’t want to always have her partner around every time. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting my kids around people who act like this?? Or should I accept my sisters new partner even though I feel uncomfortable?

50,1gjzaic,AITA for accidentally causing a fire at my friend’s house and feeling frustrated by her reaction?,"I (29f) had a close friendship with a former colleague (31f) who was a lawyer at my old job. She became a mentor to me, encouraging me to go to law school. When she opened her business, I helped out with various tasks, mostly unpaid or for small gifts. I didn’t mind much—I wanted to support her.

A couple of years in, she went through a tough breakup. Her ex cheated and gave her HPV. I spent hours on the phone, letting her vent and promising to be there for anything she needed. After her vacation, she invited me over to her new house to decompress. On the way, she asked me to pick up an expensive pizza. Even though it strained my finances, I didn’t mention it because I didn’t want her to feel uncomfortable.

When I arrived, she reheated the pizza in her gas oven, but the boxes didn’t fit well. I suggested it might not be safe, but she insisted it would be fine. While we were chatting, I noticed smoke from the oven. I panicked, thinking to throw water on it, but she stopped me, saying she had a fire extinguisher. It was still wrapped in plastic, and smoke filled the house as she struggled with it. She eventually handed it to me, and I managed to put out the fire.

Once things settled, she called the pizza place and negotiated a replacement for free. I was a bit uncomfortable, but went along. We spent the rest of the evening as planned, and she act totally normal as if nothing happened.

A couple of days later, she messaged saying she needed “distance” to reflect on our friendship. I was confused and hurt, as I’d tried my best to support her. I apologized, saying I was sorry for any disrespect. She mentioned the incident “scarred” her new home and that she needed a new oven. She suggested we meet to talk, but over the next weeks, she rescheduled or canceled five times, leaving me emotionally drained. Each time, I prepared myself, only to be let down.

Finally, I gently told her just to let me know when she was actually available, as it was hard to keep getting canceled on. I was already struggling with my mental health, so the repeated cancellations took a toll. It felt like she saw me as an assistant outside of work, rather than as an equal friend.

Since then, she’s completely stopped reaching out. I’m sad to have lost both a friend and mentor, but I also feel conflicted. Did I ruin a friendship by not being open about my feelings earlier? Or was I justified in feeling frustrated at how she treated me?

51,1gjyyhu,AITA for Not Sharing My Family’s Pasta Sauce Recipe with My Friend?,"

I (28F) have this old family recipe for pasta sauce that’s been passed down for generations. My mom taught me when I was a kid, and over time, it’s become “my thing.” I make it for all sorts of occasions—birthdays, family gatherings, and even just nights in with friends. Everyone raves about it, and I take a lot of pride in keeping it close to the original.

One of my closest friends, Emily, recently asked me for the recipe. She’s been experimenting in the kitchen lately and thought it would be fun to try making it herself. At first, I kind of laughed it off, saying something like, “Oh, maybe I’ll teach you someday,” but she kept pressing. Emily isn’t Italian and doesn’t have a lot of experience cooking from scratch, so I was a little hesitant. It felt weird giving away something that feels so tied to my family, especially since my mom always treated it as a bit of a “family-only” thing.

I tried explaining that it was a family recipe, and I didn’t feel comfortable giving it out. She got pretty annoyed, saying it was just sauce and not some “huge family heirloom.” She pointed out that I’d shared recipes with her before (which is true, but those were random ones I found online, not family recipes).

Now things are awkward between us. She’s been short with me ever since and even made a snarky comment at a dinner party about how I “gatekeep sauce.” A few mutual friends think I should’ve just given it to her to avoid drama, but others understand why I wanted to keep it private.

Anyway just for context me and my friend, lets name him Apple. Me and apple have been ""fighting for a little bit"" it's been like for the past week or two but for the first time we started fighting I realized that I was the a-hole but I'm pretty sure I fixed that problem(long story short I invited him to a party in like a month in advance and he made plans over it) something that I did tell Apple though is that I felt like a back up friend because of that  first fight, however after like 3 days we forgave each other and boom we were friends again however as I now admit that I know I'm the back up friend(I've come to terms with which tbh I'm ok with it) I am also his therapist which I get that every friends need every once in a while because life is rough and difficult so when he needs to he comes to me and talks to me about his problems. However lately it's been to much for me personally I guess I do understand that some people do just need to vent and have someone just listen to them with out giving a solution but I feel like all I can do is give solutions to problems, I attempt to be a problem solver but idk anymore tbh. So my friend is venting to me again and I'm giving solutions to the problems however he gives me reasons why he can't fix them with a solution which understandable but I was tired of listening to someone who all they wanted to do was complain about how terrible life is and why it sucks and why he should k!ll himself because no one would care. It's kind of draining you know especially hearing it after days even though I knew that there were people in his life who would be sad if he did k!ll himself. Anyway after he was venting I gave him advice idk why but I felt guilty for just leaving him on read but after he would tell me why he couldn't fix said problem I told him that, ""I am here for you if you need to vent but all I can do is listen, I can't give you advice anymore...

Anyway just for context me and my friend, lets name him Apple. Me and apple have been ""fighting for a little bit"" it's been like for the past week or two but for the first time we started fighting I realized that I was the a-hole but I'm pretty sure I fixed that problem(long story short I invited him to a party in like a month in advance and he made plans over it) something that I did tell Apple though is that I felt like a back up friend because of that  first fight, however after like 3 days we forgave each other and boom we were friends again however as I now admit that I know I'm the back up friend(I've come to terms with which tbh I'm ok with it) I am also his therapist which I get that every friends need every once in a while because life is rough and difficult so when he needs to he comes to me and talks to me about his problems. However lately it's been to much for me personally I guess I do understand that some people do just need to vent and have someone just listen to them with out giving a solution but I feel like all I can do is give solutions to problems, I attempt to be a problem solver but idk anymore tbh. So my friend is venting to me again and I'm giving solutions to the problems however he gives me reasons why he can't fix them with a solution which understandable but I was tired of listening to someone who all they wanted to do was complain about how terrible life is and why it sucks and why he should k!ll himself because no one would care. It's kind of draining you know especially hearing it after days even though I knew that there were people in his life who would be sad if he did k!ll himself. Anyway after he was venting I gave him advice idk why but I felt guilty for just leaving him on read but after he would tell me why he couldn't fix said problem I told him that, ""I am here for you if you need to vent but all I can do is listen, I can't give you advice anymore... And to be honest I shouldn't be worrying for you like a little brother or trying to take care of you like you are a younger brother because that's not my job"" and I did reassure him that he could still come to me if he needed someone to vent to but I would only be there to listen...

53,1gjysny,AITA for a 'friends' question to my partner,"Hello reddit,

I am currently fuming its been almost 24 hours since the incident occurred. I have been labelled the asshole by the other party I'll call everyone alias so my friend Cat (30F) and her fiancé I'll call Rob (24M). Me is Jade (25F) and my partner is Bill (24M).

Now, Cat came over unannounced yesterday as she'd had her fiancé's car broken into and they stole items of hers from the car. Awful that would happen and we were chatting and letting her know we had seen Rob earlier to share our sincere apologies for the loss of the items and the trauma it must have caused, as we did with as we sat and chatted now with Cat. Jokes and fun pursued, until I made a joke about the girls at Bill's work seeing Cat's engagement ring, as she went into Bills work to grab food as he works in hospitality and its a small town. They had lunch together as they are old friends and he was on break and one of the girls in the kitchen asked after cat left if that was his partner. (He said no definitely not, she's my best friends fiancé.) Anyways Cat after hearing me jest at the situation as we're friends said 'well actually Bill I have been meaning to ask' turns her chair and raises her hand to shush me, 'what did you think of me 4 years ago' .. 'like you used to chase me around discord you must have liked me, I used to have to run to Rob's chat to get away from you' .. At this point I am dead silent and shocked. My partner responds with 'Idk not really' Which made me mad too! So I left quietly to use the rest room, as they talk about how they met 4 years ago. She decides to notice me leaving and searches for me until she notices the bathroom locked as I sob. And says 'oh its ok she's just here' and returns to her chat.

I flush the toilet and pretend to let it go, I go check the chickens and collect the eggs as it's close to our back door. I return with the eggs and I hear her sing out ' are you ok Jade?' and I respond with 'NO' followed by 'I don't appreciate some bich asking my partner inappropriate questions cause she decides she chose the wrong friend I think you should leave'. I then closed myself in the bedroom and my partner asked for me to come out and talk about it with them. I did not. She uttered a sorry and left.

Now I have spoken to my partner and smoothed over that he also felt awful about her saying or asking such a question. He didn't know how to handle it. However, Rob her fiancé after Bill told him, Rob seems to think after speaking with Cat that it was fine she wanted to apologise if she hurt Bill 4 years ago by choosing Rob. I think that is rubbish. And now I am angry at Rob for also stating 'its the girls problem Jade shouldn't have taken that so far'. so I guess I am here for the internet dump and I am unbelievable upset.

55,1gjy9l8,AITA for opening my husband’s package? ,"I (28) and my husband (30) just married earlier this year. Since we took our relationship to the next level, we decided to not renew our lease with our roommate and get our own spot. During the past 6 months of living together, just us two and my cat, I mostly get a ton of packages sent to our door. 

Whenever I place orders, especially through Amazon, I always give my husband a heads up. Not for any other reason. Yesterday, I gave him a heads up that I was ordering 3 things for my sibling. I was the first to get home today and noticed 3 packages. I ordered my sibling semi big things, and immediately opened up the boxes to wash before I head their way tonight. Shortly after opening the first box, I noticed a bright color that couldn’t have been what I ordered. I quickly checked the address, it was addressed to my husband, and I set it aside and continued to open the other 2 boxes. Somehow Amazon figured out a way to condense my order only into 2 packages. I thought nothing of it. 
My husband and I then had our daily ‘after-work’ phone call, where we discuss what happened throughout our days and he quickly threw out that he should have a package waiting for him. I then told him I accidentally opened it, but set it aside for him to completely open when he got home. 

The conversation then took a turn when he began to scold me about opening his packages. I reminded him of my order and explained to him that it wasn’t intentional. That I was just expecting my orders for my sibling and wanted to prepare their stuff before I gave it to them later. This explanation wasn’t good enough. 

My husband made it seem that I was being negligent, and that “common sense is to look at the address before opening any package or mail”. Although I agree with this, I don’t feel like it’s necessary when the packages are delivered to OUR door. I was expecting the package and opened it because I thought it was mine. I also feel since we are married, it shouldn’t matter that I opened the package on accident. It’s not like I took everything out. I simply took my key swiped it across the tape and noticed it wasn’t mine, and set it aside. 

After arguing in circles, his solution was for me to check every label before opening anything and my solution is a heads up after placing an order. I told him I’ll work on looking at the label, but he thinks it’s unnecessary to tell me when he’s expecting a package. We left the conversation annoyed at each other.

56,1gjy0y7,AITA for asking my roommate to close the door when she's having sex,"Me (21f) and my roommate (28f) have been living together for about 8 months now and we get along really well. We've had some issues, admittedly because I am way messier than she is. I always thought that we had good communication though, and we have seemed to talk it out mostly reaching a conclusion. During these 8 months my boyfriend (23m) has come around the house many times. Every time he sleeps over, I make sure she didn't have any problems the night before and always ask her if we were being loud. We have never had a problem with him coming over before.

Today, my roommate brought over the guy she is seeing. He has been around a bit and I don't really mind it usually. Today, however, they came home when i was sleeping (seasonal depression has me sleeping at 8:30pm), and I woke up to the sound of them fucking. This has never happened before, and i decided to go outside to give them more privacy. On my way out, i noticed that her door was wide open. when I got outside, I texted her this: ""hey... sorry to say this but can you please close your door? I can hear everything."", ""I came outside now but if you can, please."" I don't know what i expected, but she simply replied ""sorry I never told you when you were too noisy with your visits"". I immediately felt horrible and apologized, and said you could have said something before and she just says ""ok. i try to be more understanding"". I didn't mean to embarrass her but i literally woke up to the sound of them, I just thought maybe she could close the door, which she has in the past but now she says she can't because of the cat.  I think I should have just put on some music and not said anything, but I just didn't think it would be a big deal. I always thought she would also tell me if/when I make her uncomfortable.

The two of them been dating for three months and, as couples do, they'll often spend their Friday evening at our place. I have to specify: I have no problem with the boyfriend. He is very nice, very polite. When they are together, they watch a movie in the living room without disturbing anyone.

59,1gjxk6s,AITA for telling my sister to stop being weird about our little sister’s eagerness with her boyfriend?,"I don’t use reddit so my husband made this account for me to post.

I (31F) have two sisters, “Claire” (27F) and “Anne” (20F). Growing up, I had to take on a motherly role for Anne since we don’t have a dad and our mother was absent - which in turn made every ex-boyfriend and my now husband also have a type of fatherly role for her (taking her to a father-daughter dance, teaching her how to ride a bike, she wants my husband to walk her down the aisle, etc).

Claire is, for the first time, dating a guy “Roger” for long enough that we got to meet him. Anne was extremely excited “to get a new person in the family” and the first dinner was ok, she was her usual chatty self and she was all over him (my husband even joked he was being replaced). Claire was a bit moody and snarky but that's just how she is, so I didn't think much about it. The problem started with dinner at my house. Anne cooked the whole food. She was nervous because she felt he didn’t like her much so she was trying extra hard. She kept telling him that she cooked this and that (she just wanted a compliment on it) and Claire rolled her eyes and snapped with something like “he gets it, you’re very wife material”.

Later the five of us are drinking wine on the porch and dancing. At some point a certain song started and Anne gasped and cheered up saying how she tried to teach my husband this dance but he couldn't do it (tiktok dance for what i understood) and asked Roger if he could try it with her. She kinda gets to do it for like ten seconds before Claire starts yelling and tells Anne to stop being such a whore. She goes on about how Anne’s dressed and how she’s acting desperate and thinking it's cute to act like that to other people’s men. I told her no one is trying to steal her man and she’s acting completely insane. They left and we got to talk through the phone the next day (she was ignoring Anne’s calls) and she rants about the same things and I’m again annoyed that she’s acting it was malicious on Anne’s part.

If she had just been annoyed that Anne was being too much, I’d have understood. Like yeah Anne is like an overly-hyper puppy so I get it, it’d have been ok for Claire to tell her to back off because not everyone wants to be her friend. But it was the fact that she made it seem like it was something malicious on Anne’s part. It felt very disingenuous, especially since Anne is *so* naive and also has never shown any interest in dating ever. She just got so excited to have someone new (especially older and male) in her life and it felt wrong that Claire made her feel so self conscious about it.

But also… I get it, it's a girl being eager with your boyfriend and then trying to do tiktok dances with him. I \*could\* understand how people might think this is totally weird and inappropriate, but I think someone that’s naive enough to downright say “I’m gonna cook for him because I want him to like me” is not someone that’s trying to sneakily steal someone’s man.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: Was asked for INFO in a handfull of comments and I can't belive I didn't mention it. Is Anne special needs/delayed/diagnosed with something? She was in special needs class growing up and her boss tried to get her tested because he thought they could get a tax reduction with her but it didn't end up happening. No diagnosis. I'd say it's ADHD and a bit of a low IQ but I'm not qualified to judge that.

EDIT: Thank you for the harsh judgment guys. I’ve apologized to Claire (which led to a very emotional conversation about our upbringing, which made me apologize for giving Anne more attention), Anne had already been apologizing since that night and now Claire finally responded and apologized too, saying she knew Anne wasn’t flirting with him, she just felt insecure and jealous. The whole conversation with the three of us was very long and emotional and it was so much more than the dinner so thank you guys for giving me a reality check. (Anne’s gonna start therapy).

She just got so excited to have someone new (especially older and male) in her life and it felt wrong that Claire made her feel so self conscious about it.

But also… I get it, it's a girl being eager with your boyfriend and then trying to do tiktok dances with him. I \*could\* understand how people might think this is totally weird and inappropriate, but I think someone that’s naive enough to downright say “I’m gonna cook for him because I want him to like me” is not someone that’s trying to sneakily steal someone’s man.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: Was asked for INFO in a handfull of comments and I can't belive I didn't mention it. Is Anne special needs/delayed/diagnosed with something? She was in special needs class growing up and her boss tried to get her tested because he thought they could get a tax reduction with her but it didn't end up happening. No diagnosis. I'd say it's ADHD and a bit of a low IQ but I'm not qualified to judge that.

EDIT: Thank you for the harsh judgment guys. I’ve apologized to Claire (which led to a very emotional conversation about our upbringing, which made me apologize for giving Anne more attention), Anne had already been apologizing since that night and now Claire finally responded and apologized too, saying she knew Anne wasn’t flirting with him, she just felt insecure and jealous. The whole conversation with the three of us was very long and emotional and it was so much more than the dinner so thank you guys for giving me a reality check. (Anne’s gonna start therapy).

60,1gjxg91,WIBTA to ask my entire family to help me in my dental care financially.,"To preface, I’m 25 years old and deeply struggling with my dental health. I’ve had anorexia and bulimia for the past 8 years, and am experiencing the severe damage that occurs from chronic stomach acid exposure. I have been diagnosed with Anorexia, Bulimia, OCD, borderline personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and severe depression. I am physically challenged with osteoporosis, chronic reflux and have lost control of both my bladder and bowels.

This illness has robbed me of everything. I make $26,000 a year living in Vancouver and live paycheque to paycheque. I am still struggling with acid reflux and every day i wake up with shards of teeth in my mouth. I don’t want to lose my teeth, and was told I need a full mouth rehab which is an extremely costly endeavour. I’m in the process of applying for disability but I don’t know when that will be approved. 

My parents help me out already with rent, and they are very financially well off from selling our childhood home that greatly appreciated over the years. Both are retired and work part-time. My twin brother is an engineer and he does very well for himself, and my sister is a nurse who also does very well. I have tried every single way to amass funds on my own (Gofundme, messaging government officials and asking for reduced cost care) but nothing has worked out. 

I have an upcoming consultation with a prosthodontist at my local dental school but I’m expecting a bill that likely will not be within my budget for years. I don’t want to lose my teeth, and my OCD is so bad right now I’m genuinely considering offing myself at this point because I’m so tired of being in pain. 

Would I be the asshole to ask my family if they would be willing to help me out financially.

I, a 24 year old man, was visiting my hometown for a holiday at my mother’s house.

64,1gjwrpv,WIBTA-for skipping my kid's birthday party because it's at my ex-husbands?,"My ex and I divorced in 2021. We had struggles and those struggles got disseminated to his friends and family pretty widely while we were still ""trying"" to work together. Once divorce was final, I tried to be the nice ex and do the joint friends/family kids birthdays. The first year, his friends made cutting comments behind my back (in my home) because I was frustrated with him. The reason for my frustration being that he offered to help set up since it was at my house, he arrived 10 minutes before everyone and then proceeded to act like he still lived there. Zero help given, partial credit accepted. (The next year less help and I decided separate family events after that and avoid the dynamics) He also told me at one point that his sister never came home to visit because I caused a shitshow with their parents. The same parents she wouldn't tell when she was visiting so she could avoid them. The same parents who visited her less than a handful of times during the decade of our marriage. I will be frank, his father is a partial reason I gave up on our marriage. I was told that he is the way he is and I'm going to have to get over it. He did some things that felt pretty violating and our marriage counselor agreed with that description so yeah. I don't want to be around them. 

But its been a constant struggle with establishing boundaries. It took him 2-3 years to not just walk in and then I seem difficult when I tell him the kids will be out in a minute. 

And it's not just him, the boundaries have been crossed by my family as well. My grandmother asked me in church one Sunday if she could invite him to the extended family dinner for Christmas. What was I supposed to say!?!?! My cousins were confused to say the least. It has been this way now and I just have kind of given up. The first time my immediate family drew a firm line was this past Christmas when they told him he couldn't come because my boyfriend would be there and they didn't want awkwardness. It took three years. My boyfriend is a bit of a saint for dealing with it all but he gets frustrated by it for me. 

So here's my dilemma. I have my kiddo on their birthday. I wanted to invite my immediate family over for dinner and cake. I knew he wanted to throw the friends, family, neighbors, school mates, etc party this year. I wasn't going to take away from that but he invited my immediate family and they have decided to all go. Do I go and be uncomfortable the entire time and potentially make it even worse? Or can I make their birthday special beforehand and skip out on the social show? 

And for those concerned about finances...I will be having a sleepover party the week after, so I will still be paying to help cover my kids birthday festivities in my own way.

65,1gjwr5s,AITA for going m.i.a after fight with dad.,"Context:

I (24 f) live in a rural area with my Mum, I don't leave the property much as I work from home. I do all cooking, chores and maintenance for the property. My Mum works in town 5 days a week and is in the process of splitting with my Dad who is retired used to run the farm and now lives in the city, he isn't supposed to stay nights but often will (honestly cant even say why anymore as hes used every excuse under the sun.) 

Issue: 

Last week my dad came to stay the night as he was going to do some work for my uncle. 

It was a very busy day (one of those days when you don't eat) he rocked up he immediately started to do 'jobs' that didn't need to be done. Which caused some problems that he blamed on everything but himself.

Not a huge deal but an inconvenience nonetheless.

I'd organise a neighbour to come over and help me with some two person jobs (would of told him not to come round if he had a mobile phone). 

The neighbour is an old mate of my dads so I wasn't surprised that they got to talking, I was surprised that my dad basically made me look like an idiot and pushed me out of the conversation. 

I only got a hello and a thank you in during the time it took to get the jobs done before I  picked that I was wanted around their conversation. He ended up staying an extra hour to talk to my dad.

When dad did come in I was in the middle of cooking dinner whilst my mum was having a shower. Instead of asking if I needed help he just grabbed a drink and sat in front of the TV. 

I planned to have a shower after my mum (as I was absolutely filthy) but my dad decided he'd have a shower next, which irked me alot but if I rushed I could still finish before our fav tv show started (on aired TV so can't pause).

When I get out of the shower I find that he's used my towel, which he has done before (a month ago) because it was ""in his towels spot"" and ""was his towels colour"". 

This time my towel wasn't in his 'spot' and it wasn't even the same colour.

In my hangry state I did lose it, which he'd found funny.

I'd said ""Are you just blind or stupid?"" he'd stopped laughing at that and it made the situation worse and I'll admit wasn't right of me to do.

I ended up just dishing up my food and going to my room to eat and then sleep.

The next morning whilst I had done all the chores, he had broke the toilet and a few taps claiming he was trying to fix them. 

My brain just snapped

I ended up leaving without telling anyone around lunch time to go down to the city and stay with my sister. I had planned to go the next day as I had an appointment. 

(I made sure all animals had plenty of food and water before I left)
 
I'm back on the farm and have appologise to my mum but haven't said anything of the sort to my dad (staying with my uncle). He's aparently very 'hurt' by what I did but he hasn't said a thing (text, call or in person) to me in regards to it.

I replied to her that I'd like to try something with her,but in other place in other hours (I was really surprised by her proposal,considering she ghosted me out of nowhere 3 weeks ago) because I live with my parents and they set the alarm, the thieves entered in my house some times ago.

The truth is that sneaking out of my house at 2AM ,while everyone is sleeping makes me very anxious,the possibility that I could get caught,I know that the probabilities are very low, I already did the same 2 years ago for former boyfriend and at some point it made me anxious.

Also I'm in my pijama without make up and in this moment I'm not comfortable with my look and body in this moment,I just don't feel ready... I don't think the sexual intercourse would be enjoyable,I'm the type to do it in a bed ,in most appropriate hours even if my parents didn’t knew it.

Diamond guessed it was a lie, and called me a coward who lost an ""unique opportunity"" ,that literally everyone at my age sneak out or does that,I feel sad now,because from a part I think she could be right.

I replied to her that I'd like to try something with her,but in other place in other hours (I was really surprised by her proposal,considering she ghosted me out of nowhere 3 weeks ago) because I live with my parents and they set the alarm, the thieves entered in my house some times ago.

The truth is that sneaking out of my house at 2AM ,while everyone is sleeping makes me very anxious,the possibility that I could get caught,I know that the probabilities are very low, I already did the same 2 years ago for former boyfriend and at some point it made me anxious.

Also I'm in my pijama without make up and in this moment I'm not comfortable with my look and body in this moment,I just don't feel ready... I don't think the sexual intercourse would be enjoyable,I'm the type to do it in a bed ,in most appropriate hours even if my parents didn’t knew it.

Diamond guessed it was a lie, and called me a coward who lost an ""unique opportunity"" ,that literally everyone at my age sneak out or does that,I feel sad now,because from a part I think she could be right.

69,1gjvrae,WIBTA if I kick my roommates girlfriend out?,"Okay, so I (28M) have a roommate situation that’s been driving me absolutely insane, and I need some perspective. I live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my friend Mike (28), and everything was fine until his girlfriend (let’s call her Sarah, 22F) started basically living here too—without ever really *moving in* if that makes sense. 

Mike and Sarah have been dating for about 6 months now, and I have no problem with her being here sometimes—except she’s *always* here now. And she’s, like, constantly eating and leaving stuff everywhere. Like, there’s always food on the counter, and half the time it’s just leftover bags of chips, takeout containers, or the crumbs that have somehow turned into a permanent part of the couch. I mean, I know it’s a shared space, but it’s become impossible to live here with the constant mess.

But that’s not even the worst part. The worst part is how *loud* they are. I'm talking full-on bickering, loud Netflix marathons at 2 AM, and Sarah eating in the loudest way possible—like, she’s trying to make *every* bite of food sound like a life-or-death experience. And don’t even get me started on the smell. It’s like every day they decide to order the greasiest pizza or the most pungent Chinese food, and I can’t escape it because it just lingers for hours.

Now, I know people are going to say I should talk to Mike about it, and I have. I’ve told him multiple times that it's too much and that it’s not fair to me as his roommate. But he just brushes it off, saying that ""she’s going through some stuff"" and ""I should be more understanding"" (I mean, okay, but we’re all adults here, right?). 

And the worst part? Every time I try to hang out with him or even relax, Sarah is somehow *always* there. She doesn’t even live here, but she acts like it’s her second home, leaving her stuff everywhere, occupying the bathroom for *way* too long, and never cleaning up after herself. I feel like I don’t even have a place to chill anymore because she’s *always* here, and Mike doesn’t seem to care. 

I get that relationships are important, but this is my home too, and it feels like I’m being totally ignored. It’s honestly to the point where I’m considering telling Mike that either she moves out, or I do, because this is becoming unbearable. Am I the asshole for wanting them both to move out? I really don’t want to sound like the bad guy, but I feel like I have no space left.

71,1gjvn9t,AITA for not giving my aunt a family heirloom?,"My parents passed right before Christmas last year. It’s been a hard year for all of us. They lived in Houston, and none of us kids live in state. Their care and estate required a lot of time away from home, and heartache. My brothers and I have been slowly working through the estate and finally got to where we were ready for a sale company to come in.

While preparing the property, I set aside a few heirlooms to care for and pass down. One was a silver christening cup and spoon my father had on display.

On my last trip down, I stayed a few days to visit an aunt in San Antonio, take her shopping, out to dinner, et . She and I have always been close.

When I arrived, I thought she’d enjoy seeing some of the family heirlooms I had saved, so I showed her what I had found.

She immediately started telling me I needed to give them to her, that they were all things she should have been given when my grandparents passed. I knew I had made a mistake showing her.

One item was my father’s silver christening cup. When I went to put it away, she said, “You’re not leaving that with me?” I asked why she thought I would. That night was hard. She screamed at me until I had enough and said she had to stop. She’s 89 years old. 

What is she going to do with this cup? It’s time to stop being greedy. My dad was out of state when my grandparents died.

All he had was what his parents gave him while alive, and now she was demanding those items, too.

I left before she woke up the next morning and left a note thanking her for her hospitality, that I loved her, and hoped we’d speak soon.

She ignored me for weeks and when she did reach out, it was only to berate me about this cup and spoon, demanding it be handed over.

In my last text, I told her she meant too much to me for our relationship to suffer over this and offered to send it to her. I feel like I’m being bullied into it.

Over the last few days, I’ve kept up my messages with her, sending photos of the garden, family updates, and so on. She usually would respond but hasn’t replied.

Earlier today she called me screaming, ordering me send this cup and spoon to her.

I told her if she didn’t stop yelling I’d have to end the call, and when she kept on, I did.

I’ve never hung up on her or raised my voice to her in my life. It broke my heart.

I think much of this is due to her age and mental decline, but I remain loving and respectful. I’ve kept her daughters apprised of the behavior and that I feel terrible the cup situation has her so upset, that I’ve offered to send her the cup, but they haven’t responded at all.

So, AITA? I feel terrible and so sad. She’s the last remaining relative of her generation, but my brothers & I have been through so much over the last year. I just cannot believe she’s behaved this way when she knows we’re deep in grief and overwhelmed by the estate.

It’s getting frustrating, we don’t live somewhere with any good public transit so 99% of the time he has to get rides or I have to drive him… 
It seems like sometimes he recognizes that it’s inconvenient and uncomfortable for me and his friends, he’ll say stuff like
 “haha I should stop being a bum and get a license and a car huh” 

but then when I try to encourage him to drive he shuts down.

edit: read over everyone’s responses thanks y’all for the honest feedback. 

To answer a few questions: 
No he does not have a physical condition that prevents him from driving. 

And No he does not pay rent… he lives at home with his 68 year old mother. He instead is a “struggling artist” and allows her to break her back working as a bus driver and live off her dime. 

I spoke to him about this being a deal breaker for me and he gave me a very strange answer- 
He said 
“My mom never taught me because her mom died in a car accident, so I would rather people think I’m lazy then make fun of my mom.”

Which to me doesn’t even make sense? Your mom didn’t teach you 10 years ago… you can still learn now. If she’s so scared of cars why is she a city bus driver? 
I think it’s a cop out 

I asked if HE had fear around cars and he said “a little bit”

Our eldest sister lives in Africa (she is 1/4 African we are not)

Our father passed away 3 months ago. He had a family trust which posses half his assets and it is split evenly amongst the 4 children.

His Will holds another house worth ~1.7 million dollars. This house is split between the younger three siblings and his caretaker who worked for him for 20 years and invested a small sum into a business he owned. There is also a house in Africa which he has left to my eldest sisters grandmother.

My father and eldest sister had an argument two years ago over a house my sister owned. I wasn’t involved and my Dad knew I had a good relationship with my sister so he didn’t involve me in any way.

My eldest sister spoke to me about the argument once when he was alive and mentioned that he threatened to cut her out of the Will.

My two oldest sisters don’t talk and haven’t for years, again because of a financial dispute over the same house.

When our Dad died and I read the Will I immediately told my sisters that I felt it unfair. The Will was written 2 years ago when the big dispute happened and I felt like the relationship between my dad and eldest sister had been improving. I felt that perhaps he would have updated the Will had he lived longer. I don’t think he expected to die (I certainly didn’t) but also he had been in hospital for many months and was 72

Fast forward a couple months and my two sisters are still not talking, but we have proposed that all 4 of us dilute our share of the 1.7 million dollar house from 25% to 22.5% so that out other sister can get 10%

I spoke to the eldest sister on the phone and she was unhappy with only being offered 10% and instead wants an even 20% between the 5 of us.

I haven’t spoken to her since yet but after thinking about it for a day I feel it’s wrong that she feels so entitled. I felt the additional 10% was a nice gesture, especially considering she will still get 25% of the trust. AITA? 

Edit: I realise now that I’ve been out of line trying to change his Will. Part of this is because I never considered the fact that he could die seriously, despite ample evidence. I assumed he and others shared the same cognitive blind spot, an assumption I now realise is incorrect. (From this I incorrectly assumed the Will was just out of date)

I haven’t spoken to her since yet but after thinking about it for a day I feel it’s wrong that she feels so entitled. I felt the additional 10% was a nice gesture, especially considering she will still get 25% of the trust. AITA? 

Edit: I realise now that I’ve been out of line trying to change his Will. Part of this is because I never considered the fact that he could die seriously, despite ample evidence. I assumed he and others shared the same cognitive blind spot, an assumption I now realise is incorrect. (From this I incorrectly assumed the Will was just out of date)

I think the YTA comments have been really eye opening and good.",1.0,1.0658323764801025,1,1
76,1gjuvnu,AITA for using CLR to Clear Our Espresso Machines Water Tank?,"My partner of 7 years became EXTREMELY agitated and confrontational, when she saw me use CLR to try and get rid of limescale buildup in our espresso machines water tank.

77,1gju9l4,"AITAH for using ""I love you"" as a goodbye? ","
So, for context, I have generalized anxiety disorder and often get extremely anxious that any time I see a loved one could be the last time. I believe this is a fairly common way of thinking, especially for people with anxiety. So, I always end conversations with people I'm close to with a quick ""I love you"". I think it's nice, it's a good reminder to them that they are loved and it eases my anxiety a little to know that even if something horrible happens, the last thing that I ever said to them was ""I love you"". Of course, if someone is uncomfortable with that then I readjust and don't say it to them and of course there is no expectation or pressure to say it back.

The issue started when I began saying this to a newer friend group. It was seven people including myself and we had been friends for about 3 months. I know that seems fast but I give my affection pretty freely and I genuinely loved these friends, my family was in tatters and I was struggling with a lot so they felt like my found family. When I said ""I love you guys"" for the first time, most said it back. A couple of them just smiled, didn't look uncomfortable as far as I could tell, and never mentioned any problem with it. In retrospect I probably should have just asked them upfront if they were uncomfortable.

So from then on, I would casually say ""I love you"" to the group anytime we parted ways. We ate meals together and saw eachother a couple times a day, so I was saying this to the group multiple times a day. Maybe a bit excessive, but it was just my way of saying goodbye. One day, a couple weeks into this happening, one member of the group finally snapped.

Apparently it was actually bothering them this whole time, making them very upset and uncomfortable. They yelled at me and went on this long rant about how it's disgusting and weird that I would say that to my friends, that by saying it so much I was pressuring them to say it back, that I don't even mean it because I was just saying goodbye and it was obnoxious to say ""I love you"" every time I actually just mean bye. By this point, I was crying and got defensive. The criticisms they brought up were valid and did make me think about my words more, but I said that they should have been nicer about it, should have communicated with me in the first place instead of bottling it up until they exploded on me, and basically called them an asshole who doesn't know how to communicate.

Obviously, I never said I loved them after that and we are no longer friends (there were other conflicts other than this incident). I still think about this interaction a lot and it makes me worried about expressing my love for my friends I'm the future. Am I the asshole?

He said it was a tough time, and I sympathized. A few days later, while I was in the Caribbean with my girlfriend, I got a text from him saying, ""I wish you could be here right now, I really need someone to talk to."" I assumed this meant he was struggling with his relationship, so I offered to FaceTime him. He declined, saying, ""I couldn’t do that to you."" I didn’t know it at the time, but he'd already broken up with his girlfriend.

When I returned home, I found out through a group chat that he had started vaping again, something he'd pressured me to quit for years. I texted him about it, warning him about the addiction, and he made an inappropriate joke about my race, calling me an ""ISIS recruiter."" I was offended and decided to leave it alone.

A few days later, he texted me about going to a concert, asking if I wanted to join him. He mentioned he had tickets originally for him and his girlfriend, but didn’t tell me they had broken up yet. I turned him down because I had plans with my girlfriend.

It actually hurt, so I muttered “Holy fuck” while still on the phone with him, and he immediately hung up on me.

When I finally get downstairs, there he is, standing by the door he said he couldn’t get through, somehow having managed to open it. I asked, “What was the issue with the door?” since he clearly got it open by himself. His response was, “Did you just tell me to go fuck myself?”

I was surprised and tried to explain what happened, but he insisted I’d insulted him. He wouldn’t give me the package until I gave him a fist bump, which felt awkward. This driver delivers here often, and each time there’s been some kind of issue, so I’m not sure what to make of it.

80,1gjtg3m,AITA (20F) for making my (30M) boyfriend sick from chicken pot pie?,"I (23F) made my (33M) partner sick eating chicken pot pie. At the time, I was a single mom and my boyfriend, now husband, was going shopping at the local Sam’s club. He had made it very clear before this that he has had a food aversion to chicken pot pie all of his life. Every time he eats it he gets sick. I, on the other hand, loved pot pie and could eat it all the time. There is only one time of year (during the colder seasons) that this store sells the house made chicken pot pies to take home and bake. I saw the pie, and I basically begged that we take it home. I also made it clear that he did not have to eat it, that he could eat something else if he wanted, but that I was craving the pie and wanted to eat it. After a bit of convincing he agreed to get the pot pie.

Both of us are stoners so we were baked that night, about as baked as that pot pie. After the pie was baked, I can’t lie, the aroma filled my small apartment. We fed ourselves and he grabbed a piece to my surprise. I asked if he was sure and he said it would be fine. After he finished he went back for several more portions. He must have eaten at least half the pie after he was done. I was surprised…

Later that night I see him quickly make his way to the bathroom after tossing and turning in the bed next to me. I got up to check on him and immediately heard him getting sick. He opens the door abruptly and I startle him standing in front of him. I ask if he’s okay while peering into the full SINK of vomit. It was a normal bathroom sink filled to the brim with vomit. I brought him back to bed and let him sleep, but his breath made me ill. I made my way to the livingroom to sleep on the couch but I couldn’t because the smell of the vomit was wafting through my apartment. 

I have emetophobia (the fear of vomit) and realized that if I don’t clean the sink I will be miserable all night. I got to work. I found out that my sink was broken. I fixed the sink, cleaned the puke, and made sure everything was cleaned up. It took every ounce of strength I had and I still ended up getting sick myself cleaning it.

He came back to check to see what I was doing. He saw what I did and said “you cleaned it up. You didn’t have to do that, I was going to do that.” I replied,” I couldn’t sleep because of the smell so I cleaned it up.” He just said okay after and went back to bed. 

The next day I mentioned it to him. We ended up getting in a fight. He had accused me of making him sick because I knew that it would make him sick. I didn’t force him to eat it.

I'll start by adding some content, I'm very asain, I was born in Japan and the only reason I'm mentioning this as stated in the title, her uncle is racist (pretty much the typical drunk uncle that spouts racist stuff at any family gathering) and the one time I met him he called me the slur for Asians three times and asked if I've eaten dog before. also after I said I was from Japan, he still insisted that I was clearly from china as he apparently was an expert on picking apart races as it's part of his job. He works in a bank.

Luckily my gf defended me but her family were somewhat nonchalant about what he did? Almost like they didn't care?

And I don't even know where to start with her brother, he is very into anime which I'm personally not into but it's fine he is. It's just that he seems to have a fixation with the fact I'm Japanese? Like when I was meeting her family for the first time, he immediately took notice of me and wouldn't stop asking questions? Which I understand as I'm new to the family and all but they were the strangest questions, like he asked me how hard it was to speak Japanese less in the us and that I could always speak with him so that I don't miss home as much?(his Japanese is horrendous, I could tell he's only memorised phrases from shows) and if I have any traditional Japanese items that I could show him?

I'm honestly weirded out by the both of them and when my girlfriend asked if I wanted to go to her family's thanksgiving this year I immediately said no. She was very upset with this answer as we all know the elections happen in a few days and it's going to be a political mess, and that she needed my support. But I still refuse to go as I don't want to be called racist things and be in the presence of a guy who can't separate anime from reality as well as a man who quite frankly is the kind of guy to go on an hour long rant about how immigrants are what’s wrong with America?”

Edit: I forgot to add a few details to the post for which I apologise, I’m a female not a male like what a lot of the commenters think, and her brother is a 20 year male and Another reason I may be the asshole is that my gf doesn’t like her parents as she feels they’ve never respected her decision to be with woman (she’s bi) and she wants me to go as she feels they won’t make any comments about our relationship if I’m there.

Luckily my gf defended me but her family were somewhat nonchalant about what he did? Almost like they didn't care?

And I don't even know where to start with her brother, he is very into anime which I'm personally not into but it's fine he is. It's just that he seems to have a fixation with the fact I'm Japanese? Like when I was meeting her family for the first time, he immediately took notice of me and wouldn't stop asking questions? Which I understand as I'm new to the family and all but they were the strangest questions, like he asked me how hard it was to speak Japanese less in the us and that I could always speak with him so that I don't miss home as much?(his Japanese is horrendous, I could tell he's only memorised phrases from shows) and if I have any traditional Japanese items that I could show him?

I'm honestly weirded out by the both of them and when my girlfriend asked if I wanted to go to her family's thanksgiving this year I immediately said no. She was very upset with this answer as we all know the elections happen in a few days and it's going to be a political mess, and that she needed my support. But I still refuse to go as I don't want to be called racist things and be in the presence of a guy who can't separate anime from reality as well as a man who quite frankly is the kind of guy to go on an hour long rant about how immigrants are what’s wrong with America?”

Edit: I forgot to add a few details to the post for which I apologise, I’m a female not a male like what a lot of the commenters think, and her brother is a 20 year male and Another reason I may be the asshole is that my gf doesn’t like her parents as she feels they’ve never respected her decision to be with woman (she’s bi) and she wants me to go as she feels they won’t make any comments about our relationship if I’m there. And thank you to everyone for the support but I don’t plan on leaving her, she’s still a great gf, this is literally the one issue in the relationship.",0.0,1.0356330871582031,1,0
