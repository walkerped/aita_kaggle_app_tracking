0,1gkp8ra,UPDATE: AITA for snapping at my boyfriend after he targeted me in a game?,"
Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/cygNeZuNBs



Before I get into the update I'd just like to say thank you to all the people who showed sympathy to me in the comments. I really appreciate your kind words. May both sides of your pillow always be cold (or warm, whichever you prefer)

Some people had the assumption that my boyfriend did not have any idea how emotional I was over the topic of my bio mother. That is actually far from the case. We have been dating for 2 years and he has come with me multiple times to visit her grave. In fact, the thing that made me decide to ask him out in the first place was the compassion and love he showed me when we had a sentimental conversation about it. (We had been friends already for a while before we started dating). He knows very well it's a sensitive topic. 

That being said, we talked it out and I talked to him about his behavior. He was VERY apologetic and he felt really bad. He told me that he had intended his statement  of ""you WERE targeted"" to be apologetic, but it didn't really come off rhat way. I talked to him about how it made me feel, he promised to never do it again and he acknowledged that he crossed a line. He also apologized for unintentionally dismissing my feelings when I confronted him the first time. I chose to forgive him, because i truly believe he didn't mean to hurt me so bad. Mistakes happen and I could see and hear it in his voice that he was genuinely sorry for hurting me. 

To those that were worried about me being in an abusive relationship, thank you, but I assure you I'm fine. I appreciate your sympathies but I am happy in my relationship and we have chosen to work past this together. 


TLDR: boyfriend apologized. we are still together.",UPDATE,2024-11-06,"UPDATE: AITA for snapping at my boyfriend after he targeted me in a game?

2,1gl5hwc,AITAH for sticking up for myself? My boyfriends parents are ruining our relationship,"HELP, crazy MIL ruining my relationship. 


Me (f22) and my bf (m23) have been together for 2.5 years. We had known eachother and eachothers families for over 7 years before we started dating. For context, we met at a vacation home park, my family and his family both own property there 1 minute from eachother. Both of our families visit there every summer, his family lives in the province, and mine live in a different country and only visit during the summers. Me and my bf met at this park and our families became acquaintances/friends. 

My family is relatively normal, they are kind and respectful, they don’t have issues with anyone and get along with people, but are reserved, enjoy their privacy and space and don’t put up with bullshit. My bfs family is very unique, his mom is has BPD and psychosis which she had been prescribed medication for but occasionally she decides to not take her meds, she’s nice and has a kind heart deep down but has no awareness of boundaries and will go nuts on anyone who doesn’t do as she says or wants, even towards people she barely knows. His dad is either very kind and lovely to be around/ a completely jealous narcissist, who is nothing but hateful and mean, whichever side you get of him, he is not forgiving and very quick to jump the gun and assume situations and act on it very strongly, whether it’s the right thing to do or not, he doesn’t care. His parents almost always have issues with someone they know and all they talk about is drama and issues, if not already present they will create it, not to mention they are very demanding people, will welcome themselves into to anyone’s home uninvited, and help themselves the anything. They ask over-bearing questions and put people in uncomfortable positions. They pride themselves in doing things for others but almost always will eventually use it against them in one way or another, either 1 week or 1 year down the line, and will use their “favours” as an excuse for their inappropriate, unacceptable behaviour, language and treatment. 

Time line 
June/July 2022 -things started going downhill between his parents and mine but nothing too major.
August 2022 - Me and my bf started dating, we did long distance as I didn’t live in his province at the time, but always dreamt of living there at some point in my life. 
Jan 2023 - I made the move and my bfs parents offered me a place to stay while I got on my feet. 
Summer 2023 and 2024 - when everything really went tits up.

June 2022
My parents relationship started going downhill with them when they started showing up at their property all the time, unannounced, sometimes at inappropriate times of the day. Often just to use their wifi (they did not have any at their own property), a charger, or ask for something. My MIL came over once at 10pm asking to use thier wifi and proceeded to stand outside my parents property arguing with her (FIL) husband, my mom had to ask her to leave because it was late and her younger children including herself wanted to go to sleep…. My bfs mom didn’t like that very much and thought it was”rude” and “unwelcoming”. My mom decided to set boundaries with her after a few more of these instances and she texted her kindly asking her to notify her if she wanted to come over, as she had no issue with that, but didn’t like that she and/or her husband would show up randomly multiple times a day. She also didn’t like that. My bfs mom also had started confiding in my mom via text regarding issues she was having with her husband(FIL).. then after all the advice and support my mom gave to her, my bfs mom said she was “hacked” and none of it was true… my mom didn’t like this shady weird behaviour and started to distance herself more from her. On my mother birthday she had invited all our extended family to our property, my mom hadn’t seen them in a few years. My bfs mom stopped by to drop off a cake and my mom thanked her, she tried to welcome herself to the party however my mom asked her to come back later and they would share the cake together and celebrate. This was my bfs mom’s last straw and she really did not like that, after this she would call my mom a bitch, coward, rude, etc. 

July 2022
I flew from my province to visit my family at their property, I had not been there for a few years due to Covid and spent 2 weeks with them. I reconnected with my childhood friend, and now boyfriend. He got a dog to foster around this time, a few months later he decided he wanted to keep the dog and his parents offered his help to him and me and him discussed that I would help him look after the dog. 

Jan 2023
I moved to his province and his family offered me a place to stay with them. The first month or so was okay, after that they started bad mouthing my family to my face. His mom started having psychotic episodes at/around me, and we had to go to a hotel a few nights because of this. She started getting upset at me because her and her son’s (my bf) relationship was not good, mostly because of what she had put him through his whole life. She had had the cops called in her multiple times by them and had spent nights in jail. They gave us the basement to live in, however she would constantly come down stairs and barge in, either while I was showering, sleeping, changing etc. It started to become a place we hated being at because of the constant issues and stress and discomfort they would create but we weren’t in a financial position to leave. I always made sure to be respectful no matter what they said to me or did to me and they even acknowledged that.  They treated me like their maid, and started never cleaning up after themselves because they knew I would have to clean up after them if I wanted to do anything/use anything. 

In regards to the dog (because this becomes important and relevant), me and my boyfriend payed 60% towards the dogs bills, and his parents payed 40% towards the dogs bills, however me and my bf took 95% of the responsibilities for the dog, and they took 5% not only that but they had been exhibiting that they were clearly not capable of looking after a dog properly. The dog being originally my bfs dog, because me and my bfs dog due to the time and money invested, my bf had also started calling me the dogs mom which I was okay with, and I felt that way about the dog. However his parents insisted that I had nothing to do with the dog, and that they were not going to be communicating with me regarding the dog and that it was their and thier son’s dog only. This infuriated me deep down because at this point I had done everything of the dog, and I had done more than they had ever done for the dog, and 50% of the time was because they had pushed the responsibility on me, telling me to take him for a bath because “he needs one” or to walk him or feed him or go pick up his food or take him to the vet. And that itself slowly turned into me and by bf just doing those things, with no comment from them or attempts to do anything themselves other than occasionally feed him, walk him and look after him when we were not home (which they barely did and often resorted to just leaving the dog in the crate even if they were home) completely ignoring the dogs routines with food and training and just did thier own thing. Whenever I tried to recommend that they feed the dog at the same time each day (7am instead of sometimes 11am or 2pm or 8am or 10am) they would ignore me and tell my bf that they are not talking to me about anything regarding the dog because “it’s not mine and not my business”. As time went on they only started paying less and having less to do with the dog, he just lived there and they loved him, but that was it. 

Summer 2023
This summer was tense, my bf and I started taking his/our dog up to my parents property with us every weekend to stay/visit. My bf stayed with my family instead of his because it was often unpleasant for him to be there in that environment. And therefore the dog stayed at my parents place because they where we were. 
My bfs parents would demand that he brings the dog, and often argue with him and be disrespectful to him and I. Because of this we didn’t want to bring the dog over to them, we already felt uncomfortable because of thier proven record of not being able to look after the dog properly (ie. letting him eat things he shouldn’t due to negligence, letting him destroy things, going against our training, not being able to walk him properly and allowing him to pull them places he shouldn’t go (under other people’s barbecues) or to other people unfriendly dogs. We also knew that they hid things that would happen from us, and we would find out through my bfs younger brother, ei eating medicine etc. 

My younger, (13 years old at the time) sister who I see once a year, wanted me and my bf to take her in an outing, she had wanted to see the Barbie movie so we decided on that and lunch. My bfs mother found out and became enraged and sad that we didn’t “invite her”, she took it upon herself to try and force us to invite her (my sister barely knows her) she became very upset with us saying we were mean and hurting her feeling by being left out and she felt in included, we stood our ground kindly, apologized that’s eh felt that way and tried to describe to her that it was something we were doing for my sister and it was just going to be us 3. She decided later that day to come to my parents place, where we were staying, to confront my 14 year old sister, she was clearly having some kind of episode, telling my sister she was unkind and brainwashed by us and her “horrible” son. Saying things like “didn’t your parents teach out to be kind to others” … my sister told her to go away and went to my mother crying after. My mother, not happy to hear what happened” walked over to my bfs parents property to look for her, to ask her what happened and to please leave her daughter out of her issues. Only her husband was home at the time and she asked him to let my bfs mom know that she wanted to speak with her. He was very dismissive and rude to her. Around and hour later my family and my bf were relaxing in the back deck of my parent property, when we heard yelling from up the street, we knew it was my bfs mom and walked to the front of the house to see her yelling at my mom. She was being rude and disrespectful and my mom asked her multiple times to leave, which she said “make me” or “no I’m not going anywhere” after sound 30-45 mins she of arguing and yelling and name calling, she apologized and left. However just a few days later started coming back looking for her son(my bf) demanding my family they bring him out and yelling at them because she was upset with him, my family said they can’t force him to come out and if he wants to he will but as far as they knew, he was with them to get away from her. She continues this harassment despite us and my bf asking her to not come back. Finally my parents had enough and she came back again and was told to “fuck off” (despite all the worse things she had said up to this point). The went back crying and having a panic attack and this enraged her husband. However because I wasn’t super involved and this was mostly between our families, they allowed me to continue staying with them, but at this point me and my bf were actively looking for places to move to because we were don’t worth this bs and treatment. 

My bfs mom would harass me via phone and text, but never in person, creating issues and scenarios that weren’t tru, my bf told me to block her but I didn’t want to do that and wanted to still have a relationship with her. I tried to neutralize all her comments to and reassure her and in the moment it would seem to work, and then a few days later she would be upset wet at me again over something she made up in her own head. 

March 2024
We moved out and took the dog with us. They were no longer paying for the dog at this point. His parents demanded that my bf make a weekly schedule with him and demanded 50% custody of the dog between specifically them and him and NOT me. My bf tried it make something work between US and them, but they still refused to respect me. On one occasion they asked to see them dog, and my bf told them to arrange it with me because I was home the the dog. They sent me a very short blunt message to which I responded that I would be bringing the dog over at X time, that he needed to eat at X time and went in X amount of walks already, and that I would be back to pick him up around X time. To which I received a message along the lines of “ thanks for your message, however the dog had nothing to do with you and I will be communica with your bf and him only, and me and him will decide and discuss what is best for the dog, thanks, bring the dog at X time and I will tell you when you will pick him up and I will decide when he eats, i will do what I want with my own dog, I I know how to take care of my own dog better than you would.” To which I refused to take the dog to them, and replied saying I was “shocked he would speak to me so horribly, and that I thought he was better than that.” To which I was told “I better apologize or he will never speak to me ever again and I will never be welcome at his house ever again”. We talked it out and moved on and I thought we both came to an understanding and thought he would have more respect for me considering everything he knew I had done for the dog and the role I had in the dogs life. 

Unfortunately this disrespect continues for months to come and only got worse, my bf stook up for me and told his parents they needed for respect me or they wouldn’t get to see the dog. The refused and we stopped bringing the dog over as often. My bfs mother started getting upset with ME saying she didn’t do anything wrong and how cruel to keep the dog from her snd that it helped with her mental health and that it’s not fair to “punish her” ( which we weren’t, we would bring the dog over to see her a couple times a month when we were available and able but it was not as much as SHE wanted. 

A couple weeks later someone that got into some random conversation with someone I barely knew while in a walk with me and my bfs dog. They ask me in disbelief “ so is this dog really your parents bfs dog?” I said, laughing “no” which the replied “I didn’t think so but they said the dog was with them 90% of the time and we just had him a few days a month” and I laughed saying that it was the other way around and that the dog lived with us. This got back to my bfs mom and she started confronting me saying that “it’s not fair to only bring him a few times a month” and she really wanted to see him for them that” and “why did you say I can only see him a few time a month”… I tried to reassure her that I was only talking about the current situation and wand staying that she would only get to see him a few times a month from then in. But at that point she already lost it. They both had been so disrespectful to me blatantly for so long, despite my bf trying to go NC with the and setting boundaries, nothing changed and they still managed to squeeze their way in.i decided I was not going to tolerate things anymore and I started talking back, I never called them any mean names, despite everything they wound say to me, and say I was a bitch just like my mom. His mom would try to message my grandparents to try and squeeze her way in, because at this point my mom had blocked her, they all ended up blocking her and this enraged her even more. I had not yet blocked her, despite my boyfriend and family telling me to, because I wanted to be able to try to settle any false accusations she brought to my attention for the sake of her not being able to take my silence as confirmation and I wanted to put any of her worries at ease, telling her things like it’s a misunderstanding, I never said that, we will work something out for you, we don’t want you to feel this way. Trying to settle things for the sake of me and his families relationship. His mom started coming over to my families property and yelling at me through the windows saying you can’t make me leave I’m gonna due you you bitch , see you in court, this is my dog!”. The last straw was when I was taking our dog in a walk, she must’ve seen me and she ran up behind me and started yelling at me saying she’s going to take me to court and I can’t tell her she’s not going to see the dog (which I never said) and that I can’t tell her she can’t let the dog (which I never said) and started grabbing his harness/ fur. I just kept telling her to leave me alone and stop following me, and I began making my way home, she refused and continued to follow me, yelling at me, calling me a coward etc. my dog stopped at a rock and I didn’t want to yank him away she got right up in my face and wouldn’t leave me alone and I lost it, I started screaming “get the fuck away from me” “leave me the fuck alone” “your a 50 year old woman and I’m a 21 year old girl what the fuck are you doing” and she started screaming in my face calling me a bitch. My dog finally started walking again and we went our separate ways. I managed to film the whole ordeal starting from when I heard her voice coming closer from behind me (because I had a bad feeling and could tell something was up with her) until I was pretty much back at my property. I was so shaken up from the whirl situation and called my bf, who told me to call the police and messaged his dad telling him what happened. His dad replied to him “ you can loose my contact, never message me again” , he proceeded to take my bfs vehicle out of his name and demand he comes to the house to collect all of his belongings before he trashes them. He said as long as he’s with me he’s not welcome and I will never be welcome around them. His dad from then on pretended I was invisible and even made remarks in public to exclude me, to my own friends. They all went NC for quite some time, he had only briefly spoke to him mom to say what she did was wrong however a month later started saying that if I had just blocked her none of this would have happened and that it was 50% my fault. He had started talking to and hanging out with his parents again, even though they still disrespect me and treat/talk about me horribly, in public and to my bfs face. They make unnecessary remarks and comments and he doesn’t say anything to them, he says he knows his lay are na sneers to approach them a certain way. They asked him to bring the dog over and that they wanted to work in a schedule, which he said okay to them, but told me he didn’t want to do that but he was going to try to bring the dog over a few times a month. His dad had been a little pushy with it, and made sure to throw in that I am not welcome, just the dog and him. He talks on the phone with them everyday. And they plan visits with him for lunch and dinner and “tell” (not ask) him to bring the dog with him. My bf says he’s going to speak with them about how he’s not happy with how they treat me and think it’s wrong of them and mean, and they need to apologize, but he has not yet done this. 

His mom has since message my bfs ex girlfriend talking shit about me and confronted me and my bfs friend to talk shit about me and make them dislike me. Which didn’t work, it’s common knowledge at the park that something is wrong with her so people tend to take what she says lightly. But still!!! Why??? 

To make matters more tense, after the repeated harassment over the 2 summers, we had made a total of 6 complaints. At the end of this season at the vacation park, they gave them a notice of eviction with no warning as a result of thier inappropriate behaviour. My bf, who had stuck up for me and my family thus far ( I haven’t explained it but he has) ran to his parents rescue and demanded that they receive warning before they are evicted, he managed to convince higher management to reverse the decision. And was upset that we had put in so many complaints and said it was a clear  “attempt to get rid of his parents from the park”. 

I know this is a lot to take in but I’m at a loss of what to do or feel. This is consuming so much of my thoughts and feelings and I have built up resentment toward my bf for initially taking action but then not sticking by his boundaries with his parents. Not change had happened, if anything things have gotten worse in regard to disrespect and just victim blaming and bullying. His mom has turned everything she has done around on me, made up lies a to make me look evil and bad. Which is only why I can assume my bfs father hates me so much. She’s admitted thought I my bf that she fucked up, but refused to apologize to me, he father refuses to apologize to me for the way he has and is treating me. I apologized, for god knows what. I said I never wanted it to be like this and apologized for whatever part I may have had in this, expressing that I was into easing with good intent and trying to fix things. But I learnt very quickly that his parents are the type of people that will always be the victim, no matter what. They have excused everything they have said or done to me using every thing they did for me when I first moved here against me. What do I do? ",TL;DR,2024-11-06,"AITAH for sticking up for myself?

Whenever I tried to recommend that they feed the dog at the same time each day (7am instead of sometimes 11am or 2pm or 8am or 10am) they would ignore me and tell my bf that they are not talking to me about anything regarding the dog because “it’s not mine and not my business”. As time went on they only started paying less and having less to do with the dog, he just lived there and they loved him, but that was it. 

Summer 2023
This summer was tense, my bf and I started taking his/our dog up to my parents property with us every weekend to stay/visit. My bf stayed with my family instead of his because it was often unpleasant for him to be there in that environment. And therefore the dog stayed at my parents place because they where we were. 
My bfs parents would demand that he brings the dog, and often argue with him and be disrespectful to him and I. Because of this we didn’t want to bring the dog over to them, we already felt uncomfortable because of thier proven record of not being able to look after the dog properly (ie. letting him eat things he shouldn’t due to negligence, letting him destroy things, going against our training, not being able to walk him properly and allowing him to pull them places he shouldn’t go (under other people’s barbecues) or to other people unfriendly dogs. We also knew that they hid things that would happen from us, and we would find out through my bfs younger brother, ei eating medicine etc. 

My younger, (13 years old at the time) sister who I see once a year, wanted me and my bf to take her in an outing, she had wanted to see the Barbie movie so we decided on that and lunch. My bfs mother found out and became enraged and sad that we didn’t “invite her”, she took it upon herself to try and force us to invite her (my sister barely knows her) she became very upset with us saying we were mean and hurting her feeling by being left out and she felt in included, we stood our ground kindly, apologized that’s eh felt that way and tried to describe to her that it was something we were doing for my sister and it was just going to be us 3. She decided later that day to come to my parents place, where we were staying, to confront my 14 year old sister, she was clearly having some kind of episode, telling my sister she was unkind and brainwashed by us and her “horrible” son. Saying things like “didn’t your parents teach out to be kind to others” … my sister told her to go away and went to my mother crying after. My mother, not happy to hear what happened” walked over to my bfs parents property to look for her, to ask her what happened and to please leave her daughter out of her issues. Only her husband was home at the time and she asked him to let my bfs mom know that she wanted to speak with her. He was very dismissive and rude to her. Around and hour later my family and my bf were relaxing in the back deck of my parent property, when we heard yelling from up the street, we knew it was my bfs mom and walked to the front of the house to see her yelling at my mom. She was being rude and disrespectful and my mom asked her multiple times to leave, which she said “make me” or “no I’m not going anywhere” after sound 30-45 mins she of arguing and yelling and name calling, she apologized and left. However just a few days later started coming back looking for her son(my bf) demanding my family they bring him out and yelling at them because she was upset with him, my family said they can’t force him to come out and if he wants to he will but as far as they knew, he was with them to get away from her. She continues this harassment despite us and my bf asking her to not come back. Finally my parents had enough and she came back again and was told to “fuck off” (despite all the worse things she had said up to this point). The went back crying and having a panic attack and this enraged her husband. However because I wasn’t super involved and this was mostly between our families, they allowed me to continue staying with them, but at this point me and my bf were actively looking for places to move to because we were don’t worth this bs and treatment. 

My bfs mom would harass me via phone and text, but never in person, creating issues and scenarios that weren’t tru, my bf told me to block her but I didn’t want to do that and wanted to still have a relationship with her. I tried to neutralize all her comments to and reassure her and in the moment it would seem to work, and then a few days later she would be upset wet at me again over something she made up in her own head. 

March 2024
We moved out and took the dog with us. They were no longer paying for the dog at this point. His parents demanded that my bf make a weekly schedule with him and demanded 50% custody of the dog between specifically them and him and NOT me. My bf tried it make something work between US and them, but they still refused to respect me. On one occasion they asked to see them dog, and my bf told them to arrange it with me because I was home the the dog. They sent me a very short blunt message to which I responded that I would be bringing the dog over at X time, that he needed to eat at X time and went in X amount of walks already, and that I would be back to pick him up around X time. To which I received a message along the lines of “ thanks for your message, however the dog had nothing to do with you and I will be communica with your bf and him only, and me and him will decide and discuss what is best for the dog, thanks, bring the dog at X time and I will tell you when you will pick him up and I will decide when he eats, i will do what I want with my own dog, I I know how to take care of my own dog better than you would.” To which I refused to take the dog to them, and replied saying I was “shocked he would speak to me so horribly, and that I thought he was better than that.” To which I was told “I better apologize or he will never speak to me ever again and I will never be welcome at his house ever again”. We talked it out and moved on and I thought we both came to an understanding and thought he would have more respect for me considering everything he knew I had done for the dog and the role I had in the dogs life. 

Unfortunately this disrespect continues for months to come and only got worse, my bf stook up for me and told his parents they needed for respect me or they wouldn’t get to see the dog. The refused and we stopped bringing the dog over as often. My bfs mother started getting upset with ME saying she didn’t do anything wrong and how cruel to keep the dog from her snd that it helped with her mental health and that it’s not fair to “punish her” ( which we weren’t, we would bring the dog over to see her a couple times a month when we were available and able but it was not as much as SHE wanted. 

A couple weeks later someone that got into some random conversation with someone I barely knew while in a walk with me and my bfs dog. They ask me in disbelief “ so is this dog really your parents bfs dog?” I said, laughing “no” which the replied “I didn’t think so but they said the dog was with them 90% of the time and we just had him a few days a month” and I laughed saying that it was the other way around and that the dog lived with us. This got back to my bfs mom and she started confronting me saying that “it’s not fair to only bring him a few times a month” and she really wanted to see him for them that” and “why did you say I can only see him a few time a month”… I tried to reassure her that I was only talking about the current situation and wand staying that she would only get to see him a few times a month from then in. But at that point she already lost it. They both had been so disrespectful to me blatantly for so long, despite my bf trying to go NC with the and setting boundaries, nothing changed and they still managed to squeeze their way in.i decided I was not going to tolerate things anymore and I started talking back, I never called them any mean names, despite everything they wound say to me, and say I was a bitch just like my mom. His mom would try to message my grandparents to try and squeeze her way in, because at this point my mom had blocked her, they all ended up blocking her and this enraged her even more. I had not yet blocked her, despite my boyfriend and family telling me to, because I wanted to be able to try to settle any false accusations she brought to my attention for the sake of her not being able to take my silence as confirmation and I wanted to put any of her worries at ease, telling her things like it’s a misunderstanding, I never said that, we will work something out for you, we don’t want you to feel this way. Trying to settle things for the sake of me and his families relationship. His mom started coming over to my families property and yelling at me through the windows saying you can’t make me leave I’m gonna due you you bitch , see you in court, this is my dog!”. The last straw was when I was taking our dog in a walk, she must’ve seen me and she ran up behind me and started yelling at me saying she’s going to take me to court and I can’t tell her she’s not going to see the dog (which I never said) and that I can’t tell her she can’t let the dog (which I never said) and started grabbing his harness/ fur. I just kept telling her to leave me alone and stop following me, and I began making my way home, she refused and continued to follow me, yelling at me, calling me a coward etc. my dog stopped at a rock and I didn’t want to yank him away she got right up in my face and wouldn’t leave me alone and I lost it, I started screaming “get the fuck away from me” “leave me the fuck alone” “your a 50 year old woman and I’m a 21 year old girl what the fuck are you doing” and she started screaming in my face calling me a bitch. My dog finally started walking again and we went our separate ways. I managed to film the whole ordeal starting from when I heard her voice coming closer from behind me (because I had a bad feeling and could tell something was up with her) until I was pretty much back at my property. I was so shaken up from the whirl situation and called my bf, who told me to call the police and messaged his dad telling him what happened. His dad replied to him “ you can loose my contact, never message me again” , he proceeded to take my bfs vehicle out of his name and demand he comes to the house to collect all of his belongings before he trashes them. He said as long as he’s with me he’s not welcome and I will never be welcome around them. His dad from then on pretended I was invisible and even made remarks in public to exclude me, to my own friends. They all went NC for quite some time, he had only briefly spoke to him mom to say what she did was wrong however a month later started saying that if I had just blocked her none of this would have happened and that it was 50% my fault. He had started talking to and hanging out with his parents again, even though they still disrespect me and treat/talk about me horribly, in public and to my bfs face. They make unnecessary remarks and comments and he doesn’t say anything to them, he says he knows his lay are na sneers to approach them a certain way. They asked him to bring the dog over and that they wanted to work in a schedule, which he said okay to them, but told me he didn’t want to do that but he was going to try to bring the dog over a few times a month. His dad had been a little pushy with it, and made sure to throw in that I am not welcome, just the dog and him. He talks on the phone with them everyday. And they plan visits with him for lunch and dinner and “tell” (not ask) him to bring the dog with him. My bf says he’s going to speak with them about how he’s not happy with how they treat me and think it’s wrong of them and mean, and they need to apologize, but he has not yet done this. 

His mom has since message my bfs ex girlfriend talking shit about me and confronted me and my bfs friend to talk shit about me and make them dislike me. Which didn’t work, it’s common knowledge at the park that something is wrong with her so people tend to take what she says lightly. But still!!! Why??? 

To make matters more tense, after the repeated harassment over the 2 summers, we had made a total of 6 complaints. At the end of this season at the vacation park, they gave them a notice of eviction with no warning as a result of thier inappropriate behaviour. My bf, who had stuck up for me and my family thus far ( I haven’t explained it but he has) ran to his parents rescue and demanded that they receive warning before they are evicted, he managed to convince higher management to reverse the decision. And was upset that we had put in so many complaints and said it was a clear  “attempt to get rid of his parents from the park”. 

I know this is a lot to take in but I’m at a loss of what to do or feel. This is consuming so much of my thoughts and feelings and I have built up resentment toward my bf for initially taking action but then not sticking by his boundaries with his parents. Not change had happened, if anything things have gotten worse in regard to disrespect and just victim blaming and bullying. His mom has turned everything she has done around on me, made up lies a to make me look evil and bad. Which is only why I can assume my bfs father hates me so much. She’s admitted thought I my bf that she fucked up, but refused to apologize to me, he father refuses to apologize to me for the way he has and is treating me. I apologized, for god knows what. I said I never wanted it to be like this and apologized for whatever part I may have had in this, expressing that I was into easing with good intent and trying to fix things. But I learnt very quickly that his parents are the type of people that will always be the victim, no matter what. They have excused everything they have said or done to me using every thing they did for me when I first moved here against me. What do I do? ",,0.0081125497817993,0,0
3,1gl5g30,AITAH for not giving my sick friend my time (and money),"
I 18F have been friends with F19 since I can remember, we went to the same elementary school and have always kept in touch.
When she was 12 however she found out that she had cancer, a brain tumor that even after multiple rounds of chemo etc isnt gonna go away.

I was always there at her side, went to visit her in hospitals and always shared what was mine. Spend all my money just to bring her gifts and make her feel a bit better. Money was never an issue for me tho. I liked feeling like I could do something to ease her pain even just a bit.

But over the years even though we remained friends she changed, We fully drifted appart actually and I really dont feel connected to her anymore. Her tumor made her lose alot of her intellect as weird as this sounds. She didnt grow, she got younger. I cant keep a conversation with her and we just became very different people.

Even though I still obviously care for her I chose to let things go, didnt talk as much and we just didnt hang anymore. None of it was anyones fault we just didnt match anymore.

She has a difficult home situation and is completely on her own, she was and is always welcome to stay at mine but lately she only asks me for money. She asks to borrow some money and never returns is, even though she gets money from the government and everything she always comes short. 
I should add that she smokes alot and always spends her money on useless things.
She never learned to manage her own money and she is not capable of learning anything at this point as harsh as it sounds.

She only texts me once a month to ask if she can borrow some money because she needs to go to the hospital again for an emergency, because she’s stuck at the trainstation and cant buy her ticket etc etc. All her reasons are always so valid and Ive been doing this for years now. And im getting sick of it!!
Her parents arent able to help her and I get that Im the only one that actually can at this point.

We never talk, she gets more money than I do in a month and still I give her my money and she never returns it. Sometimes she does but mostly not. 

Every time I get a message from her im scared to answer, because I cant say no to her. I still care alot about her but I just want it to stop.
Im only 18 years old and have my own things to worry about. I tried telling her but she just doesnt understand it.

Now I have gone to completely ignoring her, I feel so bad but feel like I have to save myself at some point. But im also the only one she has left. I want to help her but not this way.
I feel sick to my stomach knowing she needs help and I can give it to her but not doing it.

Its only money right?

4,1gl5eg1,AITA for not apologizing to my future mother-in-law?,"Buckle in because this is going to be a long one...

This all broke loose on October 26th when my Fiancé (24M) called during a weekend meeting saying that his parents and my parents are going to sit down and discuss the wedding. ""I'm drained. Cant it wait? It is set for October of 2026, any other weekend would be great..."" no no, it must be today.

 At the meeting, my future mother-in-law opened with an unexpected statement: “Fr1sch_Fr0sch, I love you, but I heard accusations at work that you claimed I’m not involved in the wedding. Do you remember saying this?” (For context, she previously worked as the assistant director at my daycare, maintaining a close relationship with a co-worker, T).

Surprised and confused, I clarified that I hadn’t said such a thing. I don’t typically engage in personal discussions at work. I did mention that a co-worker (M), who recently got married, asked me about my wedding plans, and I had shared that my father is covering costs due to tradition.

My future mother-in-law then proposed that her brother be the wedding DJ. My father responded, noting he prefers hiring a professional service for reliability, stating that he ""needed someone to chew out"" if something went wrong. The meeting ended abruptly after this, and I left feeling upset and blindsided.

My parents supported me, emphasizing that involving them in an issue between my future mother-in-law and me was inappropriate. It felt infantilizing.

The following Monday, she suggested we stop visiting her home. I conveyed my disappointment in a written message, expressing my discomfort and need for space, especially during upcoming holidays. I also requested that future issues be addressed privately.

Her reaction was intense; she labeled me immature and demanded an apology. My fiancé defended me, which exacerbated tensions. His brothers acknowledged the challenging work environment that might fuel gossip but maintained a balanced approach.

When we visited to drop Fiancés brother at home on November 3rd, she approached me (I was sitting in the car to respect her wishes), said she forgave me, and expressed her hope to move forward. I responded with a ""Okay"" My fiancé said that he would speak to her. He said that she cried, went to her room and broke stuff, and that his brother took her on a walk to calm down.

I have maintained that I won’t apologize for something I didn’t do. Apologies should be genuine, not concessions to ease discomfort.

5,1gl5720,AITA for not leaving my estate to my severely disabled brother?,"
I (33F) received a terminal diagnosis earlier this year. I’ve got a couple of years at best estimate to get everything in order before I won’t have the cognitive ability to do so anymore. I’ve been working with a lawyer and an end of life care social worker to make sure everything will go as smoothly as possible and my wishes will be respected.

I also have a complicated family situation.  My parents were never married and my dad died when I was 12 of the same condition I now have. He never married so all his assets were put in a trust for me by my grandparents. My mom married after they broke up and had my half-brother (26M).  He is severely mentally disabled. He’s a 7 year old in a grown man’s body and even with all the resources they can get, he’s very difficult to care for and my mom and step-dad barely get by most of the time.  They tried really hard to get legal control of my trust when I was living with them, but couldn’t. I help out some when things are really hard, but I feel like my mom treats me like an emergency fund rather than her daughter and my step-dad has been bitter about the financial stuff (my dad was very successful and his family is well off) since even before my dad died. I don’t talk to either of them about my life because they always get passive aggressive and guilt-trippy.

I’ve been trying to talk more with my mom now that I know I’m on borrowed time. We’ve never had a great relationship, but I wanted to try and resolve some of it. She’s been much nicer to me and more concerned since the diagnosis, so I thought it was ok to open up a bit.  I didn’t want her to be blind-sided or feel like she has to take on anything since I’ve appointed another family member to be my medical and financial POA, so I talked to her recently about my plans. I told her that I know my half-brother is a full time job so I’m having other people take care of my care so she won’t be burdened. She was thankful for that, but then brought up how she always hoped that I would be the one to make sure my brother was taken care of when she was gone and that in a way I still would be. She would put whatever I leave behind into his care fund and would make sure he knows it’s from his big sister.

6,1gl4wm3,AITA For asking my dad who lives with us to help more,"8 yrs ago, my mom passed away. She and my dad were married 40 yrs and she did everything for him. My husband and I decided to take my dad in so he could be with his family. He offered us $140k towards a down payment on a house that we could all live in. We purchased a house (for $535k) with a separate suite for my dad - bedroom, office/walk-in closet, full bathroom, and a large living area that he could put a small kitchen in if he wanted. The space has its own thermostat, electrical panel, is on the 2nd floor, and approximately 1500 square ft of our 3300ish square ft home. The property taxes in the community are outrageous - at the time of purchase, almost $12k a year. The mortgage is in my husband and I's name but because my dad gave us so much for a down payment, we put the property into a trust to protect his investment should anything happen to us. We verbally agreed that we'd split the monthly costs 3 ways, including property taxes, once my dad lived there full time. At the time of purchase, he still owned my childhood home and was in the process of getting it ready to sell. He also agree to put aside $10k for a house emergency that we could use if we needed to. It ended up taking him almost 3 yrs to sell his house and move in full time. During that time, he would spend half his week with us and half getting his house ready to sell. We did not ask for help with any of the utilities in the house, since he didn't live there full time. When he finally moved in, it was like pulling teeth just to get him to give us money for groceries and his cell phone, nevermind heat/electricity/property taxes.

What do I do?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-06,"AITA For asking my dad who lives with us to help more 8 yrs ago, my mom passed away. She and my dad were married 40 yrs and she did everything for him. My husband and I decided to take my dad in so he could be with his family. He offered us $140k towards a down payment on a house that we could all live in. We purchased a house (for $535k) with a separate suite for my dad - bedroom, office/walk-in closet, full bathroom, and a large living area that he could put a small kitchen in if he wanted. The space has its own thermostat, electrical panel, is on the 2nd floor, and approximately 1500 square ft of our 3300ish square ft home. The property taxes in the community are outrageous - at the time of purchase, almost $12k a year. The mortgage is in my husband and I's name but because my dad gave us so much for a down payment, we put the property into a trust to protect his investment should anything happen to us. We verbally agreed that we'd split the monthly costs 3 ways, including property taxes, once my dad lived there full time. At the time of purchase, he still owned my childhood home and was in the process of getting it ready to sell. He also agree to put aside $10k for a house emergency that we could use if we needed to. It ended up taking him almost 3 yrs to sell his house and move in full time. During that time, he would spend half his week with us and half getting his house ready to sell. We did not ask for help with any of the utilities in the house, since he didn't live there full time. When he finally moved in, it was like pulling teeth just to get him to give us money for groceries and his cell phone, nevermind heat/electricity/property taxes.

7,1gl4u4r,AITA for ignoring my family after they missed my showcase?,"I (19M) invited my family to come to a showcase at the competitive cheerleading gym where I work.  I played football in middle school and decided it wasn’t for me.  I joined cheerleading in high school because all my friends were trying out, and I fell in love with the sport.  I later found love for competitive cheer.  Fast forward to this year I now have a job as a competitive cheer coach and im also on a team at the gym I coach at too.  We recently had our annual showcase where all the teams show off their routines to their friends and family.  Because it’s my first year I am coaching the kids that are the youngest and most new to cheerleading.  The way the showcase works is the lower level teams go first and higher levels go towards the end.  The showcase is about 2.5hrs with a 30 minute intermission.  My kids performed at 12:20 while the team that I am on performed at 2:00.  Here is where the issue came.  My family has never been good with time, especially my mother.  I told them about this showcase over a month in advance and even reminded them the morning of.  The show started at 12:00, and doors opened at 11:45.  We live about 15 minutes away from where the showcase was, so I told them to leave at 11:30 and be there by 11:45.  Fast forward to 12:15 and they still haven’t shown.  I wanted my family there because even though they do stuff like this and are often late I still considered them my support group.  My kids perform and they do awesome, but my family wasn’t there. 12:45 comes and they finally walk into the gym.  The second I saw them, I had to excuse myself to go to the restroom because I was so mad.  They tried to come up to me and say hi but I brushed them off.  My mom was texting me and saying things like “it wasn’t her fault”, “they left the house by 11:50 was parked by 12:10”, “there were a lot of places on campus I got lost.”  She also lied and said she saw a part of the kids routine from the window, which is a complete and utter lie because the doors were closed when my kids went on.  When the showcase was over and I confront my family about it I start getting the truth out of them.  I checked their Life360 and found out they left the house at 12:15 and got to the parking lot by 12:40 because they stopped for coffee.  When I confronted them about this, they just ignored it.

11,1gl4aba,AITA for avoiding my aunt?,"
I (19F) have been close with my aunt and her family since childhood. I love her like my own mother. My parents would always drop me off at her house during the weekends and now her and her family live in the flat below mine. 

But it feels like she has continuously taken advantage of my love for her since I was a kid, I don't know whether unintentionally or intentionally, by always having me do her housework, looking after her many children while she goes off to trips, run errands, work, or outings, her officework that she brings home, looking after her guests, etc. She would speak ill about my parents and other family members to me, to which I would respond in silence or comfort. There have been several other issues as well, but I won't go in depth.

Also, I have been her 'therapist' for the past 7-8 years to provide her emotional support because of the rocky relationship she has had with her husband.

Two months ago, she started having issues with her husband again, and ever since then, the workload she has given me has increased. And some days ago, she accompanied her husband on his work related trip to a city much much far away, and left me with all of her children, all of whom are VERY young and one of whom was sick. All this is while I have my first year university exams in a few weeks. 

She returned this week, but I am just so tired, so exhausted. I have several issues of my own and just don't have energy to deal with her antics anymore, hence I have been actively avoiding her and going to their house ever since she's returned. I try not to make anything obvious on text though.

Regardless, has been noticing this and is getting passively upset. I've zoned out a few times before in the past because of her behaviour and she's created scenes over this but this time I'm just completely out of energy. 

I've always loved her so much but now... I feel exhausted and just done. Am I being overdramatic? Am I being selfish? Please help me. 

P.S My parents live in another city due to work.

Assuming the date of her wedding is in February, I planned a bachelorette party with girlfriends from all over BC to meet in one town and all celebrate her. (She knows about this)

And said she already booked the airbnb for them and that I have to find my own. I am the only person she really wants there and also I legally have to be there to sign.
 
This is where I struggle:
-she didn’t ask me if I am available in December 
-didn’t check with me if I can do it a week before Christmas financially- which I can’t 
-when we were discussing where I can stay I was saying that everything is really expensive and that I don’t want to pay for Friday night when I arrive at 10pm and just sleep. Meanwhile she has a giant 2 bedroom airbnb and didn’t offer that I can crush there the one night. 
-it’s very snowy here in Canada in December and I have to pass 2 mountain passes and I don’t feel safe to go. 
-my partner said straight up he is not going because it’s a very short notice and we don’t have anyone to watch our 2 dogs. 
-there is no reception after, the bride and groom are gonna bbq and they don’t drink so I’ll end up in a hotel room by myself at 8pm.

It turns out her sister and her had no idea about different regulations around dogs in the country where I am. Malls, restaurants, bakeries, bars/ pubs etc are almost always dog friendly where people’s pets are welcome and really except for grocery shops they’re allowed in and encouraged. 
Her sister became visibly upset when we for a walk the first day she came and she saw dogs without a lead walking around the city with their owners. She started really getting hysterical when we went inside a local Starbucks and she saw the dogs inside at people’s feet. We immediately went home and I told her that you can’t really avoid dogs because they’ll be out and about.

Her sister became visibly upset when we for a walk the first day she came and she saw dogs without a lead walking around the city with their owners. She started really getting hysterical when we went inside a local Starbucks and she saw the dogs inside at people’s feet. We immediately went home and I told her that you can’t really avoid dogs because they’ll be out and about. 
Her sister then told me she didn’t want to even leave my place with all these unpredictable dogs and wanted to stay indoors the entire time.
I suggested that this week and the following places they are going to visit are going to be exactly the same. The sister immediately tells me that they’ll just stay at my place for a few weeks and fly home. I told them I was absolutely not okay with this and that if it seriously was that big of a deal to her that they needed to leave.

Before this company, I had always worked in larger offices, and at no time have I ever felt obligated to clean up after other people in the office.

She used to often complain about feeling obligated to clean up the kitchen mess, but lately, I see things with her have changed. Her feelings have now morphed into ""if it's dirty, just clean it - no complaints."" And because I'm not going to clean up after adults in the office, she has decided I am ""Not a Team Player"". Since this has been going on for so long, I see how I have become extra careful not to leave a mess of my own in the kitchen.

I don't have seizures every day but I am on meds, I do still get seizures and I need to be careful about what I look at or do for too long. My mom died when I was 10 and last year my dad remarried. I was still living with him at the time. But a couple of weeks after the wedding his wife went into my study space and she broke a photo of my mom and a glass figurine that my mom used to own while cleaning. She apologized for the photo but brushed off the figurine even though she knew what it was and she did it because she thought it was ugly. I asked her why the hell she went in there in the first place. She had to go through my room to get to the study space. And she told me she was cleaning and wanted to do something nice. She told me accidents happen and I asked her how she just happened to break a photo frame holding my mom's photo and a figurine my mom used to own. She told me I was reading too much into it and that I should be grateful she was willing to even look at anything that belonged to my mom.

The fight got so bad that I decided to move out of my dad's house because I did not trust her with anything of my mom's. I also didn't want to have her to act like she could just go into my room. Dad wanted me to calm down and to let him find a replica of the figurine to make up for it. He also wanted me to stay but I told him I would not after her attitude about the figurine and what she said about being grateful she'd look at that stuff.

He worried a lot about me but I moved in with grandparents so I was safe and had other people there ""just in case"" even though I don't actually need that. He just worries about me in that way.

After the incident I do not like my dad's wife and I keep my distance from her. But he has confided in her about my condition and the stress.

She said we're family and she needs to know what to look out for and she said I'll need to be around her again sometime or I'll lose dad so we should come together and I should let her care for me too.

I didn't reply to several of her attempts and the last time, four days ago, I did reply and I told her she is not my parent, she is not my actual family, she is not a person I live with and she's not my doctor and none of that is her business.

Wren, for those who will ask. They didn't really say anything but I know neither side loves nature themed names. It was a couple of days after she was born that my parents told me they had the name Dorothy saved for a daughter after me and when I was 2 they miscarried a baby and called her Dorothy in their hearts. They told me Dorothy would be a lovely name and Dorothy Wren didn't sound terrible so wouldn't that be a nice way to honor the baby who should have been my sibling.

A couple of days later my husband's parents and my parents told us they wanted us to consider the name Dorothy and after discussing it they realized it had meaning on both sides. My ILs were helped a lot by an old elderly neighbor when they first got married and her name was Dorothy and they always considered that name for a girl, but they had all boys.

Both sets of parents said it was like a message being sent and it would be the perfect name for our daughter. My husband reminded them we had already named our daughter and she's Wren.

The parents asked me to consider it as the mom and I said no. That my husband and I chose the name we feel is right for our daughter and we have zero regrets.

They told us back in their day you took your parents and family's wishes on board with naming your children and followed conventions of the past. My husband actually argued with his parents because they don't speak to either of their first families and were estranged from them their entire adult lives. But there was still a lot of push back and my parents said it was hurtful that I wouldn't even consider it.

For context, I have a grown 18 year old daughter, who we will call F who's planning to go into the armed forces sometime in the new year, and her younger brother, who is 11, is severely autistic, we will call him W

Ever since the day that W was born, F just seemed to hate him, F was only 7 when he was born so I thought that when the two got older, they would grow out of it. What young kid isn't jealous of a brand new baby when they come to the world, and suddenly they're not getting all the attention any more. The problem is that f never seemed to grow out of this at all, a seven year age gap, one now being fully grown and the other still a child and f cannot like her brother for any reason. 

Due to the severity of w's autism, he's going to need constant care, and because of that, he will also need a constant guardian. Me and my husband are perfectly capable of taking care of him for now, but we are not immortal and we know this, so we had the conversation with f this week that we want her to be signed on as a legal guardian for her brother, in case something has ever to happen to us. 

When have we told her this, f was quiet for a moment. Then looked up from their hands and said, 

""I want nothing to do with him, and I don't care what the punishment for that is, disown me. Call me a disgrace, cut me out of the will. I don't care. I want nothing to do with him""

This came as a shock to me and my husband we knew that she did not like her brother, but we didn't think that she would be so harsh about it.

She went on to continue saying something about feeling completely neglected in favor of him, and she pointed out a bunch of examples as well, the most notable one is that for 4 years. She asked to go to a butterfly conservatory for her birthday, but we never took her because her brother was scared of insects. Or how we skipped important days to her days where we could have went to meet her teachers.Instead, we went to go see her brother in school. She brought up the term glass child and I had to look it up later that night.

She also said that she was shocked. We would even ask she says to everyone, if it's blatantly obvious that she hates her brother, but she also felt need to make clear that she doesn't hate her brother because he has autism, She hates her brother on principle because she says that he is spoiled and doesn't know how to do anything and is over favored by the entire family, not just us extended family included. 

F went out sometime after this to clear her head. She wasn't angry and she wasn't yelling, but anyone could tell that she was definitely upset with this conversation, she's safe and staying at a friend's house Not too far away for now to cool off.

We would even ask she says to everyone, if it's blatantly obvious that she hates her brother, but she also felt need to make clear that she doesn't hate her brother because he has autism, She hates her brother on principle because she says that he is spoiled and doesn't know how to do anything and is over favored by the entire family, not just us extended family included. 

F went out sometime after this to clear her head. She wasn't angry and she wasn't yelling, but anyone could tell that she was definitely upset with this conversation, she's safe and staying at a friend's house Not too far away for now to cool off. 

So internet, AITA for asking my daughter to take care of her brother when me and my husband are gone?

24,1gky277,WIBTA for Stopping Editing My Friend’s Podcast Before the Agreed Time?,"(Re-posting due to word limit) I’m struggling with whether to keep helping my friend with her podcast or walk away. Should I just stick to my commitment or back out? Here’s the backstory.

Last year, a friend asked me to help edit her podcast with a new collaborator. They wanted episodes around 20 minutes long. I had no experience with audio editing, but since I do video and animation for work, I figured it’d be a fun challenge, especially since I’m an avid podcast listener.

They couldn't pay me unless they got sponsorships, which I was fine with, being a beginner. But the episodes ended up being 40-50 minutes long—double the original time agreed upon. They said 20 minutes wasn’t enough to cover their topics.

When I started editing, I didn’t realize how time-consuming it would be. Shoutout to all podcast editors. On top of that, I have misophonia, so I’m really sensitive to sound. Most people use a lot of filler words (like “umm” and “uh”), which drives me crazy. I end up editing them out, which takes even more time.

A year and a half later and over 30 episodes in, I no longer find it fun. It’s become a chore. Every time they upload new files, I dread it. What frustrates me more is that I hear them talk about wellness retreats and expensive hobbies like it's no big deal—money doesn’t seem to be a problem for them. In fact, they earn more than I do.

The worst part is that I didn’t get credit for editing the first episode, and they’ve forgotten to mention me in the credits several times. I called them out on it, and they added my name to the bio, but it still feels like I’m not getting the recognition I deserve. Now, I’m conflicted—should I ask for payment or stop editing altogether?

I met my friend for breakfast last month and told her I’d appreciate being mentioned in the podcast itself, not just tagged in the bio. They did keep the episodes under 40 minutes and mentioned me on the podcast, which was nice, but now I’m wondering why I’m still doing this. We’ve grown apart; I’ve only seen her twice this year. She did help me during the pandemic with my résumé and helped me move five years ago, but I’m starting to feel like I’ve been taken for granted.

They’ve asked if I want to continue helping over the summer, and they say they appreciate me, but it feels like I’m putting in more effort than I’m getting in return. I originally offered to help and said I’d reevaluate at the end of the year.

26,1gkxid3,AITA for turning off my roommates laundry at 5 AM,"I (21 M) woke up to my gf waking me up due to the laundry running super early on in the morning, For context I share a house with three other college guys, and we all have pretty late sleep schedules—except for one roommate, E. Our washer and dryer are right outside my bedroom door, so any noise it makes (rattling, spinning, etc.) is super loud.

I want to just try to push through it and go back to sleep, but my gf can't sleep, and I want to prioritize her more than anything. So, I decide to turn off the dryer so we can sleep. She's mad at this point because its not just the 1st or 2nd time this has happened but maybe the 5th or 6th time just this semester alone (but that is usually at 1-2AM when we are getting ready for bed -- first time it has happened so late), and she asks me to say something in the gc, but I say that it's not worth it and everyone is probably asleep anyways, so we can just bring it up in the morning, I just want to sleep. But she brings up a good point that it's just disrespectful for someone to to run something that loud right next to our room so early in the morning/late at night.

I contemplate sending the message, and seconds later, he’s blowing up our group chat, accusing me of turning his laundry off “all the time” and saying that's why his clothes never dry. I told him it was literally the first time I’ve ever done this, but he didn’t believe me and kept pushing that I’m ""sus"" and basically making it out like I’m messing with his laundry on purpose. I tried to explain that I was just trying to sleep, but he didn't seem to care and was only focused on his wet clothes. He also doesn't have any work/career fairs or anything like that.

In hindsight, maybe I should’ve told him right away that I’d turned it off, but I was groggy and didn’t think it’d be a big deal. When I eventually decided to send the message, he had already blown up our gc. E insisted he didn’t have other times to do his laundry and accused me of being disrespectful for messing with his stuff. I suggested setting “quiet hours” for the laundry, but he said it “wasn’t that serious.”

AITA for turning it off to let me and my gf get a bit of sleep?

EDIT: I just want to add that my girlfriend did not talk to my roommate at all, and I am accommodating her lack of sleep as much as mine. The only reason I included her was to say that I am not very confrontational (especially right when I wake up), and she brought up a good point I wouldn't have noticed in my groggy state of mind trying to just go back to sleep.

Also, the house has also discussed that we have free reign to bring girlfriends over 24/7, and both me and Roommate E do this. The other roommates said they would as well if it was not long distance/single for them.

Me and this roommate already have had multiple arguments leading up to this point with the biggest one making me want to move-out entirely and sublease my room. This is why I didn't want to bring up another argument again, but in hindsight I should've due to the problems it will cause for the remaining few months I live here.

The multiple arguments we've had in the past has just ended up with him crossing boundaries over and over again, so I just kinda gave up fighting it ( which is why i didnt say anything the first couple of times), and I'm trying to just wait until the lease ends. My girlfriend only brought it up because I have also complained about it in the past but past arguments about boundaries ended up with him just reverting to his old actions a couple of weeks later and then the cycle repeats. Although my girlfriend was the one to wake up first this time, it is definitely not the first time I have woken up to it.

At the breakup left a huge mark on me and I broke down. Unfortunately, we did merge our groups friends to become a bigger group and everyone started to be friends with everyone else and we both were new in the group so everyone befriended us equally at the same time.

After the breakup I decided to distance myself away from large group hangout, I got out of the WhatsApp group and I tried to be as far away as possible. For me to heal and grow out of the pain. 

I demanded from my close friends not to mention my ex’s name and not to talk about her infront of me. I said I will understand minimize talk but don’t extend the talk and don’t let me know anything about her specially new stuff.

Unfortunately, my friends failed multiple times to do as I pleased, they often mention her name sometime they talk about future plans with her and they compliment her, in rare cases they even compared the two of us.

I always get upset and I always tell them after the hangout how that effect me and made me feel. (Note that it has huge impact on me negatively because my anxiety will kick in out of insecurities).

Yet, they still do mention her, and they always say stuff like “We forgot”, “We didn’t notice” and “I couldn’t avoid it”. 

Couple of days ago my friend was talking about a trip she had with my ex and her new partner infront of me, the conversation happened while she was talking to another friend on FaceTime, I got upset that they were talking about this infront of me specifically that I just knew that she had a new partner which was hugely uncomfortable.

She recognizes that she also wasn’t the best friend and she will try harder not to trigger me.

I never asked them to cut her from their life, I just want them to cut her from mine, is it too much to ask?

According, to another friend who also faced a similar backlash from me that this is too much to ask, and it’s my problem and they can’t hide her from me because she is part of their lives too, and it has been a year and I should focus on moving on instead of trying to avoid anything related to her.

I feel like moving on and acceptance is my responsibility and I’m working on it, but I need my friends to offer me a safe environment where I won’t get triggered in my way to heal.

I only have two friends, and one of them is indian like me and my other friend is a local.

She inspired me to go get a job too so I could do something since most of my day i’m just sitting and scrolling on tiktok, and also make some
money and more importantly improve my social skills.

I told my dad, and coincidentally a place around 50 metres away from me was hiring so I talked to my parents and applied. In the span of 3 weeks I did my paperwork and yesterday I had an interview. My mom walked with me to drop me to the place, wished me luck and today I got an email that they’d like to proceed further. When I told my mom, she seems very happy. My job manager told me to come to the place to finish my paperwork and start training tomorrow.

That changed when she got engaged to a man who, frankly, was terrible. Despite all the red flags, she chose to ignore them. For a while, I had a decent relationship with him, but they had countless issues, broke up and got back together multiple times, with incidents of abuse. Eventually, two weeks before the wedding, he ended it — or, more accurately, he broke it off. My sister went into full meltdown mode, blaming everyone but herself or him for the breakdown of their relationship. After a month of her playing the victim and refusing to accept any responsibility, I told her that it was both her and his fault, not my family’s. I also told her that he was abusive and a bad person. She took that personally, stopped talking to me, and blocked me on all platforms. It’s been four years since then, and she’s still holding a grudge and refuses to speak to me.

Last year, I met my now-husband. His family owns a business that he works for. The company is doing well, but since all the brothers are involved, there are constant financial disputes. When I introduced my boyfriend (now husband) to my family, my sister left without even greeting him. I’m sure she couldn’t handle seeing someone else getting engaged, and maybe she was especially upset that it was me. She later apologized, but the cold treatment continued through all the events leading up to my wedding. The only time she acted civil was at my wedding, where she took a couple of photos with me for show, but I didn’t care much about that since she hadn't been supportive of me for the past four years. I’m fine as long as she doesn’t interfere in my life.

Now, here’s where we are: I was working from my parents' house, and she was there too, though in a separate area. It’s an open space, so we could overhear each other’s conversations. I overheard her talking with my brother-in-law’s wife about giving them money as a cash injection for their business. She planned to give him money to manage their working capital, with a contract stating he’d pay her back with interest. She also told her not to tell me.

I lost it and told her to stay away from my husband’s family and not to get involved with their business. While she’s absolutely entitled to do whatever she wants with her money, I don’t want her to become entangled in their financial issues. I’ve kept my distance from their family’s drama, and I don’t want to be dragged into it now. By giving them money, she’s putting me and my husband in a position where we could face fallout from her involvement in their business — which, by the way, is their only source of income.

Some family members are telling me that, as consenting adults, it’s none of my business. Others are supporting me.

AITA?

That changed when she got engaged to a man who, frankly, was terrible. Despite all the red flags, she chose to ignore them.

Last year my dad got married again. His wife has a 7 year old daughter (she might be 6) with this rare chronic blood issue that has affected her heart. It could be terminal if she doesn't get the right transplants and she's a rare blood type and they struggle to get the match for I think bone marrow? But she's also waiting for a heart transplant. I don't know all the details. I'm not that invested in my dad's life or the stuff going on with his new family.

I am with them one weekend a month and I try not to let my disinterest hurt the kid. This means she has bonded with me even though it's totally one sided and I think it's because her life has revolved a lot around her health and hospitals and she doesn't have a big family or friends because she rarely is healthy enough to go to school.

With all that said they take her on mini-vacations when she can and when they can afford to. My dad wanted me and my sister to join in as often as we can so his stepdaughter can have family around her, just in case. Like in case she doesn't survive. I know she wants me there. My sister has never met her so I'm not sure she cares about her. But my dad does and his wife r*eally fucking cares*. She surprised me but she cares. They invited me on like 9 already and I never go. I never want to.

while i was there i didn’t get to sleep as the house was right next to a pub and we were attempting to share a sofa. so i was up for nearly two full days or 40 hours. i have suspected ME/CFS too so the long trip home was especially hard on me with the delays.

today, i need to dog sit. my mum’s on a course and my sister (17F) needs to go to sixth form so i was woken up early because my sister needed to get ready for school.

the issue lies in the ways we dog sit. she feels that the only right way is to be in the dog’s face all the time no matter what, whereas i know that if you leave him be he’ll just take himself off to bed and relax there.

so she came to me to tell me that i needed to be with the dog in my parents’ room. he wasn’t doing anything, he was just sleeping. so i told her no because he doesn’t need me in his face while he’s trying to sleep. she has a go at me telling me she’s trying to get ready for school (which is still two hours from now at 12pm. i’ve been up since 8.) and that i’m “not doing it properly.”

at this point i told her to fuck off and let me sleep because i am inevitably feeling extremely unwell today. she’s not said a word to me since, the dog is still sleeping and i suspect she’s going to refuse to go to school for this reason and blame it on me.

As you can perhaps understand, I'm quite annoyed by this, but don't know how to handle it. A few weeks ago he was lecturing me about car engines (I literally can't even drive) and I tried just straight up telling him ""hey, I'm not really interested in this"" and he got offended and then started telling me ""I'm not interested in this"" every time I tried to share a piece of info (even if it was relevant to him!) with him.

35,1gktmt6,AITA for expecting to get a phone for my birthday and getting upset that I didn’t?,"I (17f) will turn 18 in 2 days. 

For some context, my phone hasn't been working properly for a few months, and when I told my mom she told me that I could have a new one for my birthday if I just waited. Two weeks ago, it completely stopped working and hasn't turned on since. I told my mom and again she told me that I would get one for my birthday. I've had that phone for 6 years and took great care of it, and I wasn't asking for a super expensive phone, just a nice one, that works well and lasts more than 2 years. I normally don't ask for anything for my birthday, but this time I really needed it.

Yesterday, my parents went to go pick up my present and when they got home they told me that I could get one hint on what it was. I asked ""what brand is it?"" thinking that I was getting a phone, but my mom told me ""there's no brand"", so I was a bit confused. I asked ""it's not a phone?"" and she told me no. I later found out through my brother (16m) that they had bought me 2 books for school and 3 books that I had been wanting. It's a very nice present of course, and I'm not complaining, it's just that I thought I was getting a phone and I really needed one. 

So I went back to my parents and asked why I didn't get a phone. My mom told me that she ""thought this present was better"", to which I told her that I really needed a phone because I haven't had one for weeks and it's making it very hard to communicate with people, or do other things. She started to get upset with me and told me that I shouldn't expect something, and that they didn't owe me a phone. I just said ""but you told me I was getting one"" and she snapped at me and told me that I was entitled and spoiled, and then said ""what did I do to deserve such an ungrateful daughter"". 

I know that I could've reacted better and showed gratitude for my present, and I wish I had, but I was just very confused and didn't understand. I also feel like this is a bit unfair in a way. This summer she just bought my brother a very nice phone because he broke his last one after having it for less than 2 years. And there wasn't any occasion, it wasn't a present, she just bought it.

I didn't sleep properly for about 3y now and I'll explain later why. So, I'll paint the picture of the situation first - I'm an only child and my parents are from the Gen X generation and even though I'm an only child , I was still raised to be very independent and it was seen as OK if you'd kept your kid fed, warm and clothed. I didn't lack anything but I'd had to figure out a lot of things on my own and this I understand because my parents have their own business and they were constantly working on it from 6 in the morning to sometimes 8 at night - obviously leaving little room for time to spend with me. I don't mind this because it made me very independent and as an adult it has payed off.  I've been married for 10y and figured out along the way I have major fertility issues - so as you could imagine I'd had a lot of surgeries done and we had to go through IVF to get my son. It took as 8years to finally get to the point of pregnancy remaining. This is where my lack of sleep started because I was always worried that I'd still miscarry and after that risk became a lot lower there were a lot of medical issues with my son. He currently is 2,5y old and already had 2 surgeries to fix some issues I'd rather not go into details about. My son is perfectly healthy outside of the medical issue he has. When he was a baby I didn't notice it as much but the past year I've noticed my parents regularly giving 'unwanted' advice. As in, every time they see my face it's always something. It's either I have done something not as they would or I haven't noticed something and I should change this or that. I know it's out of love for my son and they can only focus on one (since I'm an only child) so I get it but I feel we get no freedom in our parenting. I also have some ground rules in my house - which they don't follow but yet when I go to their house I'm obliged to follow theirs. It's nothing major but simple things like taking off your shoes before you enter etc. When I say I don't like something they go ahead and do it anyway. I feel completely surpassed as a parent and put down in my ability to make decisions. I know they will not see it like this if I'd mention something about it but I don't know how much I can still take before I will burst out in anger and maybe say things I don't mean.

I didn't lack anything but I'd had to figure out a lot of things on my own and this I understand because my parents have their own business and they were constantly working on it from 6 in the morning to sometimes 8 at night - obviously leaving little room for time to spend with me. I don't mind this because it made me very independent and as an adult it has payed off.  I've been married for 10y and figured out along the way I have major fertility issues - so as you could imagine I'd had a lot of surgeries done and we had to go through IVF to get my son. It took as 8years to finally get to the point of pregnancy remaining. This is where my lack of sleep started because I was always worried that I'd still miscarry and after that risk became a lot lower there were a lot of medical issues with my son. He currently is 2,5y old and already had 2 surgeries to fix some issues I'd rather not go into details about. My son is perfectly healthy outside of the medical issue he has. When he was a baby I didn't notice it as much but the past year I've noticed my parents regularly giving 'unwanted' advice. As in, every time they see my face it's always something. It's either I have done something not as they would or I haven't noticed something and I should change this or that. I know it's out of love for my son and they can only focus on one (since I'm an only child) so I get it but I feel we get no freedom in our parenting. I also have some ground rules in my house - which they don't follow but yet when I go to their house I'm obliged to follow theirs. It's nothing major but simple things like taking off your shoes before you enter etc. When I say I don't like something they go ahead and do it anyway. I feel completely surpassed as a parent and put down in my ability to make decisions. I know they will not see it like this if I'd mention something about it but I don't know how much I can still take before I will burst out in anger and maybe say things I don't mean. Am I onto something or am I just being overreacting and is this normal?",0.0,-0.0037895108107477,0,1

39,1gkry9z,AITA for avoiding a coworker who keeps asking for personal favors?,"I (26F) have been working in an office environment for a year. Over the course of this year my coworker Stan (37M) has been asking me for personal favors no mater how many times I refuse. Favors like rides to work, dog watching, dropping car off at mechanic, house sitting, grabbing lunch, ect. 
Personally I have a hard time saying no when people ask me for favors. I love helping people and want to be nice. But I also recognize there are people who will see that in me and use it to their advantage.  

The favors started small, ""oh are you grabbing lunch? Can you pick me up something too ill venmo you?"" Or ""Do you have any meetings in the next hour? My car is in the mechanic just down the road, can you drop me off real quick itll only take 5 minutes"" ""Do you have any plans for the weekend? I need to fly out for a work trip could you watch my dog? Ill pay you heres her schedule its only for a few days and you really only need to take her out 3 times a day""

I started noticing that he would set me up for a favor. He would first ask a general question to see if im busy or where im going, then small talk about it then strike. Why is he trying to corner me and make it harder to find an excuse to say no? And he's gotten me to do a few favors because of that! A few times ive been so caught off guard that I didn't know how to say no.

On one hand i do feel bad for the guy. He's married but his wife moved to another state an 8hour plane ride away. And he doesn't seem to have much friends. Soon after his wife moved I was looking for a place to rent and he tried to get me to move in with him. I immediately said ""Yeah no that definitely wont work. My boyfriend wouldn't like that."" And stan said ""well he's more than welcome to come hang out too but i get it"". As if a married dude asking a young woman to live with him isnt weird at all...

My boyfriend hates this dude. He knows him through sports outside of work and has warned me that he's a leach. My boyfriend also got really upset when he found out that i gave Stan a ride once. So now i try to avoid doing any favors for him. But sometimes i will be literally walking out the door and Stan will say ""oh sweet are you getting lunch ill come too!"" and start walking with me. 

Ive never watched Stans dog. But lately hes been pressing hard for me to watch his dog. Hes asked me 5 times in the last couple months. Hes also making comments to other coworkers all the time when im around about how he wishes someone would watch his dog and how he really needs to go on work trips. It makes work feel tense and uncomfortable. His desk is right behind mine.

I just wish he would leave me alone and never ask me for anything again. I try to avoid talking to him but its pretty difficult when we work so closely to. I feel cornered. How do i get out of this? I dont want to involve HR and make a big deal out of this but it does bother me. AMA.

I told my mom if i could go (This is because my parents meet half way if i ever want to be LA, and this concert is in LA so she must drive halfway to meet my dad), but she got mad at me, calling me spoiled and a bugaboo. The main part she kept mentioning was she didnt want her sister to take me to the premiere if my dad decides he cant go, because she and my mom are ""enemies"" and hate eachother. she also got mad that i ask to go to practice (sports), and that when she was my age she had a job and didnt ask her (alcoholic, broke, abusive) dad to go places like i do.

I genuinely feel so stuck, i feel ashamed to even ask anymore. she looked at me with the most terrifying, almost like evil look as i walked out her room, defeated. she said (at the end) that shed give me the $15 (FIFTEEN FOR EACH TICKET) for me and my little brother to go, as she said she ""felt bad"" but proceeded to call me selfish and that if i want to go so bad, then ""you do you"".

We are behind on phone, internet, electric and rent. We will be late on rent next month and possibly January while we get caught up. 

My husband's birthday is at the end of December and he has to renew his driver's license.

Now, his family always over does Christmas. At least 4 celebrations for his side of the family and all require buying gifts for games, and all of his extended family.

We moved provinces and the net was stored at my inlaws house my brother in law took it upon himself to just go take it and use it at his home which I didn’t say anything because the child was using it. I have mentioned the net on several occasions saying I wanted it back once they no longer uses it a few months ago they moved & I made a point to say don’t forget the net please and asked them not to leave it out in the winter as even tho it’s 30 years old it’s little tikes and on pristine condition.

To which she replied she didn’t ask to be born. We have given her nights off before when she didn’t feel well or had other things going on so my husband and I were confused at where all this came from.

We had a pretty big fight and she stormed out of the house. AITA for not letting her completely off the hook because she felt sad?",1.0,1.047042965888977,1,1
48,1gkpl9y,AITA for confronting my roommate?,"I moved into a dorm for university and I decided to dorm w a friend I had met that year.

Yesterday night, she and I stayed up. At around 12:30 AM, I wanted to sleep since I haven't been getting enough sleep lately. I tell her, ""I'm going to sleep soon"" as an indicator that I expect the lights to be off soon. I got unready and whatever and came back in the room at around 1 AM, this time asking her, ""will you be done soon?"" and she promptly said ""yeah, after this"", so I sat, waiting outside the room (it's a suite, so there's a shared living space) while reading something mild.

She kept the volume high (as well) without headphones while watching her show, so that was why I left.. I couldn't read (or sleep). It was especially loud this time. she gets annoyed at me when i ask her to wear headphones usually but.. go queen, i guess. 

1:45 AM, I walk in.. it had been long enough since I wanted to sleep. She was watching her show. So I say, ""girl, are you still not done watching yet?"" and she says ""I continued watching since you left the room"". I get upset and I said ""okay well, I'm going back outside as I left my device on the couch"". So, I leave and come back at 2:10 AM and she had the lights off and had slept. I actually couldn't go to sleep and ended up staying up until 3 AM (my decision entirely)

The next day, her alarm wakes me up at 6 AM (which she doesn't end up turning off until I wake her up and tell her to). 

She asked me ""can you not sleep?"" to which I was like ""yeah, i cant sleep"" and she says ""maybe a change of place, maybe you should try sleeping on the couch?"" (may not be word accurate but its close with meaning and emotion). I paid for the room.. and you're suggesting I sleep outside? I don't know if she meant for it to sound that way but I was pretty upset. I managed to say ""nah, the couch is fu**ing uncomfortable"".

Next time I get to talk to her is 6:30 PM, to which I confront her; ""if i like leave, it's indicator im waiting for you to turn off the lights as i can't sleep with the lights on"", and she's like ""when you get into bed i usually turn off the lights"" which isn't true at all. In fact, I always turn the lights off myself. 

So I said, ""I don't do that, I typically wait for you"". Then I proceed to tell her about the headphones issue (the volume I mentioned earlier). 

""Also, could you wear headphones?"" 
""I usually finish watching quickly."" 
""Like mornings and afternoons, evenings, are fine without headphones but please use headphones at night. It was really loud last night, and lowkey, I could hear it from outside the room door."" 

To which, she makes a slight face, as if perplexed, and then says ""okay"", and doesn't say anything else** (edited) and left the room.

I didn't know what else to do or say aside from that.. this isn't the first time btw

i told her i didn’t want to talk about it anymore since i didn’t say i was going to buy it. she said that it was fine that we could drop it. i told her i was going to take a dab (US election anxiety🤪). she said my name but in the way of her saying “please dont smoke.” she constantly tells me that she doesn’t like that i smoke and how bad it is for me even thought i have my med card for PTSD and trauma. 

she didn’t say anything after that and i reminded her that my therapist told her to detach from my smoking. she said “i don’t want to upset you.” i again told her to detach like we agreed upon. she went “fine! when are you going to pay me rent?” this just didn’t sit right with me bc of everything that happened before this. it felt like she was trying to prove a point and make me mad. i told her i will pay rent on friday when i get paid from my job and that i didn’t appreciate how she went about it. she said she did nothing wrong. she wanted to know if i could pay rent this month and that was all.

I picked her up and we went back to my place when she asked if she could sleepover too. I wasn't expecting her to sleepover but its no problem because we have a guest room. The next morning I dropped her off to her other friends place and we said we would try to meet before she left the next day. 
I never heard from her and I was changing the sheets in the guest bedroom and it seems like she got her period. There was a lot of blood and went through the mattress cover and stained the mattress.

We're pretty good friends (but have been growing apart) so I offered to pick her up from the airport and hang out for a bit. I picked her up and we went back to my place when she asked if she could sleepover too. I wasn't expecting her to sleepover but its no problem because we have a guest room. The next morning I dropped her off to her other friends place and we said we would try to meet before she left the next day. 
I never heard from her and I was changing the sheets in the guest bedroom and it seems like she got her period. There was a lot of blood and went through the mattress cover and stained the mattress.

I'm really upset because she hasn't said anything about it and if I knew earlier I could have tried to clean it right away.

53,1gkny9u,AITA for asking my roommates to not turn the living room thermostat above 75?,"So I live in a pretty small apartment with two roommates. It is very well insulated, so whatever the thermostat is set to the whole apartment will heat to, with the bedrooms being directly off of the living room.

They are somehow comfortable at 80 degrees, which I find to be sweltering and extremely uncomfortable. Personally I find 70-72 to be fine, but trying to compromise with them I asked if we could keep the thermostat at 75 max, for the aforementioned reason of heating up my bedroom too making it so I can't escape the heat.

I can open up a window, but then my room cools down to like 60 degrees, then I have to close it until it gets too hot again, and cycle through this which is pretty annoying going through hourly 20 degree swings. Plus this makes sleeping a nightmare of waking up in the cold, closing the window, waking up sweating, repeat.

55,1gkn6m9,AITAH For expecting my partner to pay for dinner?,"

My (31M) partner and I have been going out for a little over a year. We don't go out very often because he's always busy at work or doing music stuff (he's in a band). I have a 3 year old daughter so when we do finally get to go out and have that one on one time it's great.

So the incident happened last week, for context he makes a significantly lot more money then I do as he is working full time and I'm currently unemployed financially helped by my government but I am trying to get a job. But im absolutely fine with that, it just get annoying after awhile when he continues to brag about it and it just kinda makes me feel like shit. Like yeah cool you can buy this, this, and this I wish I had that luxury.

Anyway wanted to plan a date night quoting him ""I wanna take you out let's go out for dinner"" forgive me if I'm wrong but if someone were to say that to you, you would come to the the conclusion they would pay for the night out? So he booked a table at a rather pricey place about a week in advance, and then the night before we were gonna go out he asks me ""are you able to pay half?"" I was a little dumbfounded when said that. Because he was probably checking if I had the money (as I live week to week and have to be careful with what I spend) i said yes because thankfully I did have enough and I had a bit left over that week. 

So we went the next night had a lovely dinner. But after we had gone home I just asked him about it, I don't remember the exact words but I think I was something along the lines of "" hey, so you know how you said you wanted to take me out I kinda thought that ment you were gonna pay"" I said it in kinda of a shy way because I'm not big on conflict. He just kinda of laughed and shook his head and said no, and the proceeds to say "" I grow being tought by my parents everything is split 50/50, and that my mum and dad paid everything for themselves"" I went on to say ""yeah but when you offer to take some out the general idea is that you pay"" he said ""well I did take you out like i said i would i got you out of the house"" I rolled my eyes at him the he kinda got shitty and the said 

"" I'm sick and tired of you thinking that just because I have money left means 'We' can go and spend it together no Lora (fake name)  I work hard for my money and want to spend what I have on other bills ect""

I told her politely this time it was her responsibility as a mother to make sure he is soaking his feet everyday and that obviously he hasn't been as there is puss and he needs to go back and get antibiotics. His feet are so bad, he refuses to tell her they hurt I am sure so he doesn't get bitched at for not taking care of himself, today they went and she sent me pictures and they very obviously need surgery. I lost it, told her it was neglect. That she should have been making him do it everyday, even though he is 14 he isn't exactly mature and he needs extra help and reminders that it was her job as his mom to make sure it hadn't gotten this bad and she failed to make him a priority.

58,1gkm2va,AITA for ignoring my neighbour over my fuel?,"I recently moved to a new area and was introduced to a neighbour by my landlord who i help out from time to time with odd jobs. The deal has always been that if i need to call on him he will be there as I live in the countryside and don't drive

One day around two weeks ago we were doing a job, and he needed fuel, so i grabbed the jerrycan i had in order to save him time having to go to the gas station, This fuel which was specifically for my strimmers and the deal was that he would refill it and return it to me. Bear in mind iv also been waiting 4 weeks for him to repair his chainsaw so i can borrow it, and a week for him to fix something in the house.

Anyway i wake up today, sun is shining, and so i call around to collect my fuel and his not home (his out doing a job for someone else) anyway i ring him a few times, he finally answers and basically tells me its my fault for leaving the jerrycan at his place and then hangs up the phone on me. I sent him a text saying thanks for wasting my day, and i remind him that his the one who never bothered to return the fuel to me after i helped him when he needed it (i mean its November so little chance of anymore good weather)

I'm really starting to get annoyed with him, Twice in the last week i dropped everything i was doing because he phoned me needing urgent help, the pay he gives me is shit, and the deal has always been that if i ever need him, he will be there. I'm beginning to feel like i'm being used and that he doesn't respect me. He has no problem coming to me when his desperate for help, but the moment he has some breathing room, he forgets about the favours he owes me, and his off doing other jobs. The favours owed are in lou of good pay, yet im always bottom of the pile.

The other thing about this guy is that iv noticed he can be very manipulative of other people, for example my landlord had paid him money to give to someone else for a job, and he spent the money, telling me that the guy who my landlord wanted to him to pay had owned him money for something else. I mean he was asked to be a middle man for payment of a job, and then tried to use my landlords money to take money owed to him by someone else.

He tried to call me after dark this evening I didn't answer, but he had dropped off my fuel however i feel that the only reason he dropped it off is because he relys on me for shit. As iv seen how he manipulates other people.

I haven't replied to him.

He knew my fuel was there solely for my gardening and hung up on me and told me it was my fault for leaving it at his, yet he was supposed to refill it and return it.

I (23M) and my roommate Justin (23M) are med students. We've been living together as roommates for two years, and  we live in a hostel. 

Last week were our final year exams, and it was absolute hell. We were surviving on 2-3 hours of sleep daily, fueled by coffee and energy drinks (I know it’s not healthy but there’s no other way to pass lol). 

On the last day of exams, Justin was unusually exhausted. Around 1 am, he decided to sleep and told me to wake him up at 3 am. I agreed.

However, by 2:30 am, I was dead. My brain was shutting down, my notes were getting blurry and I knew if I stayed up any longer, I'd pass out. I decided to wake Justin up early.

I woke Justin up at 2:30 am and told him the time and suggested he set an alarm so he wouldn't oversleep. Justin sat upright, rubbed his eyes, and nodded and said ‘alright’. 

I was like ‘don’t forget to set the alarm’ and then almost instantly fell asleep.

We both woke up at 8 AM. (I had set my alarm for 6 but I kept hitting snooze). Justin freaked out, accusing me of not waking him up as promised. 

I reminded him that I did wake him up at 2:30 AM and suggested he set an alarm. Justin said that he was too sleepy to comprehend what’s happening and insisted that I should have stayed awake to wake him at 3 AM or at least made sure he was fully awake before sleeping. 

Justin's exam didn't go well, and now he's blaming me.

I understand his frustration, but I think he's being unfair.

In our family, holidays are rotated, so one person hosts the Fourth of July, another hosts Christmas, and another hosts Thanksgiving etc.. This way, no one is constantly hosting, and it makes it fair for everyone. This post is about my middle daughter, Clara. Clara has always been skipping her host duties, when it gets to her she has an excuse why she can't host. It ranges but usually goes along the lines of stress or she is too busy. 

This results in other family members to pick up her holiday. It is frustrating and multiple people have talked to her about this. She bailed on hosting Easter but promised me that she would do Thanksgiving we swapped holidays. At the time I made it very clear she needed to stay true to her word and if she dumped it on someone else she wouldn't be going to Thanksgiving. It usually gets dumped on me.

Anyway, I called her asking if she wanted me to bring a dessert board for Thanksgiving. She told me that she could not host because she had just moved into her home (she moved in July), and it was too messy to host. I told her she could clean since it was a few weeks away. She told me she can't. 

I know the other kids can't host it, (well one could but she is doing Christmas and its not fair at all for her). I informed everyone it would beat my place this year. I also informed everyone that Clara is not invited this year to Thanksgiving.

Clara was pissed when I told her that and we got into a huge argument. She thinks I am a big jerk. My other kids are split, two of them are happy since they are tired of picking up her slack when this happens while others things this is too far.

so my dad wanted to make something for dinner tonight that i absolutely hate (i said it a few times but he never listens). he hadnt started the cooking process yet, so i decided just to make my own meal. 

while i was making it, my dad saw the food and got upset. he started raising his voice at me, telling me i live in ‘lala land’ and dont care about anyone or anything else, and just saying mean things. i apologized, went to my room, and cried. 

i wouldve asked if i could eat something else but he was busy with my sister. i make my own meals very frequently, and i didnt think this would be a problem. maybe it hurt his feelings? i dont know why he had to make me cry tho.

62,1glb79y,AITAH for Confronting My Nanny Over Screen Time and Lack of Attention?,"I recently hired an older woman as a live-in nanny for my 1.5-year-old daughter while I work from home. She’s been with us for three weeks, and things were going well—my shy daughter had warmed up to her. Besides watching and playing with my daughter, she has no other duties (we have a housekeeper and chef, and I handle all diapering, bathing, and bedtime).

Lately, I noticed she’s on her phone more, scrolling Facebook, especially when my daughter watches TV or her iPad. One main reason I hired a nanny was to reduce my daughter’s screen time with more engaging activities. We discussed this in the beginning, and she seemed to understand.

Today, while my daughter, the nanny, and I were playing outside, I went inside to shower. When I came back, I found the nanny on the couch watching videos while my daughter watched YouTube. My husband had previously asked me to be patient with her, so I kept that in mind. However, when she saw me, she went to the kitchen, made a call, and laughed and chatted while I prepared food for my daughter. At one point, she told me I “should” be the one to feed my daughter, and when I asked why, she said, “I thought you’d want to.”

I then asked her to reduce her phone use around my daughter, which led to her raising her voice, saying no other employer had asked her to stop using her phone, and that she’d always used it while working. I reminded her that I’d seen her leave my daughter alone briefly on camera and that I expected her full attention, especially since I was upstairs. She became defensive, saying I shouldn’t prevent her from talking to her teenage daughter three times a day.

After I started feeding my daughter, the nanny followed me, still visibly upset. She said if I wasn’t happy with her work, I should just say so, and implied I was making her feel inexperienced. I calmly told her I didn’t want to argue in front of my child and explained that I expect reasonable requests to be respected in my home. This calmed her down slightly, but she remained visibly agitated, huffing and tapping her fingers as I fed my daughter.

Once my daughter finished eating, I told the nanny that I’d take her upstairs to let the nanny cool off. She mockingly laughed as I left. Now, I’m wondering if I overreacted, or if she truly doesn’t respect me and my household. AITAH?



TLDR; Hired a nanny to reduce my child’s screen time, but she’s often on her phone. Confronted her; she got defensive.

63,1glax6d,AITA if my dog is involved with issues at a dog park through the fence,"I have no idea what to do.  I have a 30 lb terrier and we visit the dog park every day.  Because of the change in time, every day, there are the same 4 dogs in the big dog area.  I bring my dog to the little dog side.   One of the dogs on the other side is hyper focused on mine and, before I can even get into the fence, his dog and mine are aggressively barking at each other.

What ends up happening is they’ll bark very aggressively, then dart back and forth the length of the fence and repeat this for a couple times.  My dog will then veer away from the fence and do his business and explore the little dog side.  The other dog will stand there barking incessantly until mine goes back and this all repeats.

Now, after several weeks, all of the big dogs join in.

Well today (and several times before with the single dog mentioned above) while this is happening, one of the big dogs will nip another and all hell breaks loose.  Today, in 5 min, 2 of the dogs attacked the others and it got super hairy.  

My dog has zero issues with any of the small dogs ever.  Has never attacked, snipped at, or barked at another dog on the little side.  But that ONE DOG on the other side and mine have beef and this always happens.  I’m not going to say any of the 4 dogs on the other side are bad, they are dogs and to me, this stuff happens but….

AITA for kinda not caring and in my mind, blaming the big dogs?  My dog hasn’t bit anyone, theirs all have.  I’m a very reasonable person and I’ve talked to the man and was 100% willing to get his number and check out times when he’s there/not there and just be friendly (he is friendly too)…….

65,1gl9im4,AITA For Telling My Mum That She Upset Me?,"I (F19) love my Mum, but she has a tendency to say and do things that make me very upset. Some examples are: Barging in my room or the bathroom without knocking (she will literally swing the door open full force to open it as fast as possible), insulting my weight/appearance everyday, starting arguments with me for absolutely no reason, starting fights with my Dad then putting the blame on me, and many other things. Everytime she does one of these things, I tell her that she has upset me, and she either doesn't talk to me for days or lectures and screams at me about how she's right and I'm wrong. I am fed up.

 Here is where I might be the TA. A couple days ago I snapped and (again) told her that all of these things have deeply upset me and I am fed up of her constantly playing the victim. I shouldn't have snapped at her, but I did not know how else to express myself in that moment. And of course, she hasn't spoken to me since then and is barely even giving one word answers. 

She has been doing this for years, and I have never given her a reason to act like this with me. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't even want to talk to her in general anymore, and funnily enough, that is upsetting her. So please be honest, AITA for being assertive and expressing how I feel?

66,1gl9esq,AITA for sticking to a scheduled time?,"Husband (39M) got upset with me for sticking to time limit I (37F) put on our day out.

I had booked tickets to a matinee show in London for DH and I to go and watch while kids (10F and 5F) are in school. I had arranged for close friends of ours to pick the girls up from school as we likely wouldn’t make it back in time to pick them up. I had told our friends that we would aim to be back by 6pm as I was unsure about whether or not they had any plans themselves for the evening (they did have plans from 7pm).

I had mentioned to DH that we should try to get into London for Midday at the latest so that we could go have lunch before the show as we wouldn’t have an awful lot of time after the show. DH mentioned on the train journey in that he wanted to go to a store to look for something and hopefully buy it. I mentioned that this would cut into our lunch time but okay. Once he’d purchased what he was looking for we had a little over an hour left before our show was due to start. DH mentioned somewhere for lunch that would be fairly quick to eat at and on the way to the theatre. Turns out the restaurant had closed or wasn’t where he’d thought it was initially and since we’d walked so far we had about 40 mins before the show start. We decided to get snacks at the theatre and then go somewhere to eat after.

During intermission we looked at the local area map on our phones and found a place we thought would be good for dinner. We walked quite a bit to get there and discovered it hadn’t yet finished with its renovations so wasn’t ready for customers. By this point it was getting later than I’d hoped so suggested we go somewhere close conscious of the time it would take to get back to our friends. By this point DH (who isn’t feeling very well anyway) was getting grumpy. He’d found a different place but it was a 12 min walk away from the train station. I suggested the place we were standing outside of and he began arguing with me stating i clearly didn’t want to spend time with him and how spending time together was important to him. I reiterated that spending time together is important to me too but we had children to pick up. That it was a school night and I didn’t know if our friends had plans. At this point he said he just wanted to go home because he felt like spending time together felt ‘forced’. I didn’t argue and said fine let’s just go. At this point we travelled home in separate seats without talking. In the taxi on the way back home we got into an argument about the situation and how DH thinks I don’t want to spend time with him and how I hurt him and I argued about respecting our friends by not being too much later than we said.

68,1gl8wch,AITA For not helping my sister,"I’m (26M) the youngest of five siblings. My sister (29F) has two kids, is separated from their father, receives government aid each month, and doesn’t have a driver’s license. Since we were living with our dad, he would usually drive the kids to and from school. Recently, though, my sister got her own place and asked me to move in with her to help with the kids’ school runs, as well as any other transport they need, since she says she’s planning to get her license (though she’s been saying that for years).

I agreed to help, packed up my stuff (and my cat) and moved in. I helped for about a month until we had a huge fight. One morning, I asked her if she could wake me up because I was exhausted from studying and working on my IT projects. Her response was, ""I'm not your mom; you need to wake up on your own.” I was hurt and snapped back, ""I'm not your husband, yet I’m taking your kids to school."" She took that badly, and we had a big argument. I ended up moving out without telling her.

I went back to live with my dad, where I was living before, and things were fine until today. He exploded on me, saying I need to go back and help her, that it’s my responsibility. I told him I’d help out when I’m available but didn’t want to move back in with her. He demanded that I be there at 7 a.m. tomorrow to take the kids to school. I tried to explain that I’m exhausted from studying, have a bad sleep schedule, and might not be able to wake up on time. He got mad and said, “That’s not how you respond; you just say yes and go.”

A few minutes later, I went back to try to make peace and said I’d go tomorrow. But that only triggered him more. He started yelling things like, “You’re 26, and you’ve done nothing with your life! You’re a useless brat, a loser who just stays locked in his room. At 26, your brothers and I had accomplished so much. You’re nothing; you have no skills, no life. Aren’t you ashamed?”

I tried to tell him that I’m the youngest and feel a lot of pressure with two kids to take care of, on top of my master’s degree studies. I told him that none of my siblings pursued higher education, and he mocked me, saying my degree means nothing until I’ve finished it and that my brothers have already done more in life without it.

When I pointed out that I’m still trying to build my future and need to focus on my studies, he cut me off, screaming, ""We’re done talking, you little idiot.""

Honestly, I feel crushed by his words. I never expected him to come at me with that level of anger. Now I’m starting to question myself.

We don’t need anything and both parents still spoil us so it’s not like there will be nothing. He told me to fu.

I told him no that’s ridiculous it’s just we’ve spent a lot recently and we still have all the family and out own kids, both at home 18 & 24.

So am I the a..h… for suggesting no gifts this year

  
to clarify 

1. we are ok financially have some put away for future and some for oh crap situations, which is where the money came from for all the unexpected purchase. He had a job scare a few years ago, he thought he was loosing his job. So money is always a hot topic. I handle the finances and keep us on track. He doesn’t care or want to know what’s what. As long as bills are paid and there is food he thinks all is good. I didnt want to do the presents cause we spent so much it’s hard to put more out. He wants a couple hundred to spend which I said no way to. He flipped out.   
2. we have had marital problems for years we hardly talk to each other and since Mother’s Day havent slept in the same bed..that’s a whole other situation.  He has always been insecure I’m not even allowed to have both our dogs at once to snuggle he will literally rip one away from me.   
",Not the A-hole,2024-11-06,"AITA for suggesting no presents  Aita…I f50 and husband m53 are in a fight right now…I said last night I have a suggestion about Christmas. We just bought a new washer dryer set, about $2200. In the recent months we’ve had to replace my tires, about $1500 and husband needs his replaced come spring. We also had to replace the aver the range microwave, about $500. So in total that’s a lot of money going out. I suggested we forgo gifts to one another. We don’t need anything and both parents still spoil us so it’s not like there will be nothing. He told me to fu.

70,1gl8rou,WIBTA for getting kicked out of a wedding party and refusing to go to the wedding?,"Hello everyone. I (31M) have had a good friend (30M) who asked me to be a groomsman for his wedding. I happily accepted and was super excited to do this.

However, I was just notified less than a month before the wedding that I was no longer a groomsman, but expected to show up to the wedding. This caught me by complete surprise as I had no idea this would occur. My friend said that we don’t spend enough time together and that he thinks I wouldn’t be a good groomsman for his wedding, since we aren’t close enough and he’s not sure I would show up. We usually hang out on the order of once every 2-3 months or so, and have done this pretty regularly for years. Recently (since summer) it’s been hard to hang out because I have a lot on my plate in my personal life (shifting career, increased work responsibilities, house maintenance, travel) and it’s tough to find time to hang out when most of the time I would hang out with this friend we would be going to a bar or brewery, which I really just don’t want to do anymore. I still consider this friend to be one of my best friends though our interests are diverging now. I just have other things I need to and like to do now, though I make time when I’m able. I usually only see my friends infrequently at best so I thought this to be very normal in your adult life. So far I can’t think of a single conflict we’ve had and he has never broached the subject of him thinking we don’t hang out enough. 

This also hurts me because I have spent quite a bit of money to be a groomsman - I’ve been to multiple wedding party events that I have paid for and had to get a full tux that I also have paid for. All in all I’m out $500 for all of this, excluding the bachelor party which I have been uninvited to. I’ve done everything on time when it was needed and generally I thought things were going very well.

My friend gave me the ultimatum and said if I do not go, I am no longer his friend, meaning I will basically get kicked out of this friend group permanently. This feels pretty underhanded to me to kick me out on a whim with zero prior discussion and expect me to show up and be happy about it, or lose the friendship permanently. 

I now, don’t want to go at all since this whole affair is extremely frustrating to me and I lost a lot of respect for my friend and how he handled this and how manipulative it feels. I can think of a million things I’d rather do than go to this wedding now. But I also could be the bigger person and still go. I’m really hurt by all of this and really upset at the whole situation, it’s been on my mind permanently.

Not sure if I would be the asshole or not for not going. I’m thinking just get them something from the registry don’t show up and be done with it.

74,1gl7e5r,AITA for banning my roommate from using any of my kitchen supplies and ingredients after repeatedly catching him using them without replacing anything?,"Since my last roommate post had a lot of traction, I wanted to ask what yall thought about his other actions so far.

For the past couple of months my roommate E has been using my spices, sauces, and other similar ingredients like condiments. We had 1 argument about it in our last apartment, but he said he'll stop, but that he won't cover the cost of the stuff he used because it's not that expensive/ doesn't know the full cost of things. I was pissed but begrudgingly accepted it since we were already in a roommate contract for next year at the time and I didn't know how much it all costed either. 

Fast forward a year and the same roommate and his girlfriend have been continuously cooking and using my stuff over and over again without me asking. Anytime I brought it up I was met with dismissal and that it really wasn't that big of a deal. They claim they replace the stuff, but I started keeping track, and I’d end up paying for things I used maybe 1/5 of the time before having to replace them. Often, I’d go to make a recipe and find that something was already used up.

Ultimately, I felt like nothing I said really mattered because I didn't exactly record picture by picture posts of the sauce/ spice amounts changing by day lol. Eventually his timing of cooking dinner changed to roughly mine ( 6 - 7 PM) so we were often cooking at similar times. When this would happen I would often see that he used my stuff and I asked them if he could help buy the next one. For the first couple times he said yeah yeah, but eventually I was just flat out ignored. It came to a boiling point when he and his gf started taunting me with a bottle of saffron I had stored up ( super expensive spice) and started putting it in their rice dish for no reason at all just to spite me.

I blew up again and not even a week later he uses my cilantro and I tell him explicitly not to use it, and his gf tells him to back off, but he just says fuck it im pretty sure it's mine, it's not his cilantro rotted in the fridge 1 week ago, I tell him that his was rotten and his just didn't believe me since we were fighting so often up to that point. 

That night I just said that I was done and they weren't allowed to use anything I own, knives, cups, plates, pots/pans, etc. He said that was too far, and tried to retaliate by saying I couldn't use anything he bought either, but he quickly realized he only brought about 1 glass and 4 plates. He then complained that there is no way he can cook/clean without any of the stuff and how it's not fair that my other roommates can still use it. 

In the end, he did restock a few ingredients, but it was nowhere near enough to cover what he’d used. We agreed he could only use salt and pepper and was banned from touching my nicer kitchenware

I know it sounds extreme, but I feel like I tried setting boundaries, and he just kept crossing them.

I feel like the third wheel even though there's 5 of us altogether .
They push eachother into me and it really hurts. My parents are thinking to put me into martial arts classes to learn to defend myself.
The other day it got too much.
They were pushing and shoving eachother into me and saying really rude remarks about my food and about me for instance that I look like something really bad (I won't say) and I honestly hate it.
I put my foot down and told them in a really loud voice to NOT push me about and that they really need to stop all the nasty things.
I have no other friends in school and I feel like I'm always following them around.
I've often heard my friends talking behind my back of how I'm bossy but all I do is wish I went to another school. Most of the time they're the ones that are bossing me about e.g. we were playing a game where I was in one jail cell 2 were in the other and there was a police officer I didn't want to be alone so tried to pretend the other friend was with me but my ""friends"" just shouted at me more saying if I wasn't playing properly I wasn't gonna play at all.
When I shouted at them they were so shocked that I even dared to do that, I told them that if they weren't gonna stop I would be really mad but because they've never seen my mad side they brushed it off
I got really angry the other day and snapped telling them that if they didn't get their act together then they should prepare. I told them all the things they've done wrong and that I've been pushed over my tipping point.
There's this friend that's bearly ever in and when she's in she doesn't understand why I'm so angry but honestly I'm that angry I want to flip off at her 
WHAT SHOULD I DO ?? AITA ?? PLEASE HELP ME ??",Not the A-hole,2024-11-06,"AITA BECAUSE I FINALLY PUT MY FOOT DOWN I (13f) have reached the final straw with my friends. They constantly push me around tell me what to do and honestly I'm sick.
I feel like the third wheel even though there's 5 of us altogether .
They push eachother into me and it really hurts. My parents are thinking to put me into martial arts classes to learn to defend myself.
The other day it got too much.
They were pushing and shoving eachother into me and saying really rude remarks about my food and about me for instance that I look like something really bad (I won't say) and I honestly hate it.
I put my foot down and told them in a really loud voice to NOT push me about and that they really need to stop all the nasty things.
I have no other friends in school and I feel like I'm always following them around.

78,1gl6tcy,AITA for telling my MIL to fuck off? ,"So my husband Cassian (30M) and I (28F) and I have been married for three years and am currently 30 weeks pregnant (will become relevant later). Cassian has never had a good relationship with his mum because she was very invasive when he was a kid and did a bunch of really crazy stuff to him. Constantly accused him of doing drugs/having unprotected sex, drinking, and so much more. For example of severity, one time after she wrongly accused him of stealing her vodka, she pressed the lid of another bottle against his mouth and said something to the effect of ""If you want it so much, then drink the whole bottle right now. Drink it."" And tried to make him drink it (he left the house). She found the bottle later because she'd put it 'somewhere safe'. 

To clarify, all of these things were just wild accusations and its safe to say that he didn't have a good relationship with her in his childhood or adulthood. 

He has an okay relationship with his dad - a lot better than his mum - and they talk at least once a month, but its very rare that he has contact with her now. I've met her once or twice. His family tend to have these really big birthday parties (He has five brothers and an incredible amount of aunts/uncles/cousins) and there was one this weekend that we both went to for one of his uncles that he was close to growing up and still speaks to now. He knew that his parents were going to be there but figured with everyone else that was also going to be there that we could just avoid his mum or whatever worked. 

All was okay when we got there; we milled around for a bit and Cassian ended up going off to speak to one of his brothers and I was making my way over to go to see one of his aunts when I was stopped by his mum. I thought she wasn't going to do anything at the party so we had a conversation and she asked me about how everything is, and then asked if she could touch the baby bump. I kind of laughed it off and said that I'd rather she didn't - because I'm not a big fan of people I don't know touching me lol. She started getting pushy then, saying stuff like 'I'm going to be this baby's grandmother' and 'I have a right to know them and watch them grow up'. 

She continued and said 'I know that Cassian hates me but that's because he was always such a sensitive child'. To me, this was the point when I was just done with her shit and so I told her to fuck off. It just proves to me that she's not changed because she still doesn't admit to doing any wrong and treats mine and Cass' kid with the same entitlement that she treats him with. I said she had no right to see the baby and that if she hadn't gotten the clue by now, then she probably never will.

I know I could have been nicer about it but I was just done. Cass and I left and he's not really bothered by it at all but I know I could have dealt with it with more tact.

79,1gl6bbq,AITA If I don't care that I embrassed my partner in front of their family?,"Today's my birthday and my partner blew up on me after I resisted correcting a grammar mistake in our family group chat. 

I was sending a thank you message to everyone for all their presents and I put two commas in a sentence that didn't need them. Growing up people used to think I had ADHD or had Dyslexia, nope I'm just dumb I guess. So I have Grammerly as an add on to my keyboard which I rely on to avoid big spelling/grammar mistakes. *If this post has any blame them.

They pointed out my mistake immediately and insisted I correct it asap. I also got a super condensing lecture about how I sound dumb and it's sooooooo embarrassing in front of their family. I did edit it but it took a few minutes to update and they kept going on and on till it eventually was ""fixed"" 

I do not care if someone makes a spelling or grammar mistake the majority of the time. If it's some official document or there's so many the message is unreadable then sure I'd think get it together dude. But a mistake here and there especially in a personal group chat who really GAF? I said I wasn't embarrassed and now their upstairs sulking. I do regret shouting towards the end but I think I'm justified because they were being judgement.
