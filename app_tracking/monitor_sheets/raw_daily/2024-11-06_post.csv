Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/cygNeZuNBs



Before I get into the update I'd just like to say thank you to all the people who showed sympathy to me in the comments. I really appreciate your kind words. May both sides of your pillow always be cold (or warm, whichever you prefer)

Some people had the assumption that my boyfriend did not have any idea how emotional I was over the topic of my bio mother. That is actually far from the case. We have been dating for 2 years and he has come with me multiple times to visit her grave. In fact, the thing that made me decide to ask him out in the first place was the compassion and love he showed me when we had a sentimental conversation about it. (We had been friends already for a while before we started dating). He knows very well it's a sensitive topic. 

That being said, we talked it out and I talked to him about his behavior. He was VERY apologetic and he felt really bad. He told me that he had intended his statement  of ""you WERE targeted"" to be apologetic, but it didn't really come off rhat way. I talked to him about how it made me feel, he promised to never do it again and he acknowledged that he crossed a line. He also apologized for unintentionally dismissing my feelings when I confronted him the first time. I chose to forgive him, because i truly believe he didn't mean to hurt me so bad. Mistakes happen and I could see and hear it in his voice that he was genuinely sorry for hurting me. 

To those that were worried about me being in an abusive relationship, thank you, but I assure you I'm fine. I appreciate your sympathies but I am happy in my relationship and we have chosen to work past this together. 


TLDR: boyfriend apologized. we are still together.",UPDATE,2024-11-06,"UPDATE: AITA for snapping at my boyfriend after he targeted me in a game?
