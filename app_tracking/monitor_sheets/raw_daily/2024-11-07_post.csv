0,1gm4dav,AITA for calling my mom “unreliable”.,"I’m 16 years old and I needed a foam mat for a science project. The only problem is these are not near or house and at a store 30 minutes away. I don’t got a license so I told my mom before I went to school to buy it for me. Just to make sure she did, I even sent her messages during school to get it which she agreed to. When I got home (Tuesday), I discovered that she completely forgot about it and said that she was too tired to drive to the store right now. I was slightly nervous because the project is due Friday but it wasn’t too big of a deal because I was sure I could do it in that time. So, I told her to buy it tomorrow (Wednesday) and sent her a message during school again to buy it. When I got home, she was chatting with friends she invited over. So I reminded her if she got it and her reply was no, so I asked if we could go right now but she said no because her friends are here. At this point, I was irritated but didn’t push it and just made her promise she’d get it tomorrow. Eventually, her friends did leave around 7 but i was already deep into my homework by then and didn’t get to bed until 11. So today rolls around, and I told her she must absolutely get it now as the project is due tomorrow. She confirms and says she got it but when I got home, she didn’t have the dang thing. I was irritated at this point and just remarked that even with all my reminders that she still proves to be unreliable. She got mad and started screaming at me calling me ungrateful and critical of her mistakes. So now I’m in the car with my friend going to that store because my mom refused to take me after I said that to her.

1,1gm4c7o,AITA for telling my area coordinator that someone left a vape out in the office,"So background information. I work in an early headstart program that works with low income families. The company has several locations in a regional area. Our building is small with only 2 classrooms, a children's bathroom, an adult bathroom, and a small ""basement"" area(4 steps lower than the rest of the building)  that holds the kitchen and the small office area. The property is supposed to be tobacco free. I have two coworkers who vape. Now I've turned a blind eye to them vaping on property, not my place to complain and they only do it once all the children are gone. Today, however, I was doing a parent teacher conference in the office. Normally the child stays in the room but kiddo was crying so we brought him to the office as well. Now these kiddos are only 2/3 years old in the classroom I work in, so they are into everything. I was talking to the parent when kiddo grabbed something shiny. I realized it was one of the vapes and quickly snatched it and tossed it to the side on the desk before continuing with the meeting like nothing had happened. I was going to just ask whose it was but when I got back to the office after cleaning when the kids left, it had been picked up. Since I know it could have been two people, I decided to contact the area coordinator and inform her of the situation. She is visiting in the morning(11/8/24) but I feel sick to my stomach about being that person who could be considered a snitch. I just feel like it crossed a line when it was where a child could easily get to it. We also use the office space for testing and in case of tornados/intruders. Just, AITA for reporting it instead of just speaking up and asking them to be picked up? I'm not a manager or anything, just a teacher like the others.

2,1gm3ao3,AITA for backing into a parking spot with someone behind me?,"I live in an apartment with a parking garage. It's a fairly narrow garage, two cars can pass going opposite directions but it's close. Pulling out of a parking spot in the morning can be difficult since you have to do a sort of three-point turn to get out. For that reason, I usually park by backing into my spot so l can just drive straight out. I don't drive a very large car, it's a Jeep Compass (midsize SUV).

Today I pulled into the parking garage, and another car was behind me. I knew he was there but I decided to back into my spot anyway. Usually this isn't a big deal, a lot of people back into the spots in this garage for the same reason as I mentioned above, but during the time you're backing in that person behind you has to wait since it's too narrow to pass.

As I shifted into reverse, the car behind me kept pulling forward towards me. I turned on my blinker and started turning towards the spot to try to signal that I was just backing into the spot. He laid on his horn and kept inching closer to me as I backed up. Eventually he shifted into reverse and backed up to let me park.

I will say, I'm not inept at this maneuver, and even with him blocking me I was pulled into the spot within 15 seconds. If it took a long time for me to pull in I could understand being upset and honking, but I pull in backwards in the same amount of time it takes to pull in forwards.

I put the car in park and I look up to see the guy who was behind me stopped in front of my car and getting out to come talk to me. I opened my door and he walked over to me and started yelling. I lost my temper too and we spent a bit shouting and swearing at each other before he got back into his car and drove off. I made a few choice gestures at him and at the same time noticed his wife and kids in the car with the windows down watching this whole thing go down and I felt bad.

4,1gm0dfk,AITA for not covering the bill for my friends?,"I (20F) and 3 of my high school friends (all 20F) met up and got dinner after not seeing each other for a while. It wasn’t my idea, but I was invited and very excited since it had been a year since the four of us were all together.

They kept making comments about how I had “a big girl job,” that I could’ve paid the whole bill and be fine, and that I was being selfish for asking them to pay me back.

5,1gm0c39,AITA for not paying any bills at home ,"
I’m 27 and still live at home with my parents. A few years back my parents were struggling to make the mortgage payment after the person who lent them the money kept raising the payment. I’ve always been good with saving and handling my money so I went ahead and payed off the remaining 60k balance. I spoke with my dad beforehand and he agreed to pay me back little by little as he could. I wasn’t too worried at the time since I was just glad to help them out. Around the same time I took out a truck under my name for him, again I wasn’t worried since he had always been good at keeping his word. Fast forward 3 years and I haven’t received a single cent and to top it off I ended up paying 12k out of pocket to pay the truck off since he couldn’t make the payments. As of late my dad has been bitching that I don’t help out enough at home with the bills and that all his money is going to light, water and grocery bills. Apparently I’m not contributing enough in his eyes and every time I bring up the fact that I haven’t gotten any money back yet he gets defensive and says he’ll just sell the house and give me my money back which would be absolutely stupid on his part given the absolute joke the housing market is right now. I pay the insurance on the truck but that’s about it, I figure that I should at least be able to live completely free for all the help I’ve given them and it’s only fair. What do y’all think?

6,1glz3gc,AITA for refusing to feed my sister's kids for free every day?,"My older sister (37F) has 3 kids under 10. I (25M) don't have kids yet but I'm a junior sous-chef and I cook a lot in my spare time. During some recent time off from work my sister asked if I could babysit her kids after school for three days. I said yes. I watched the kids. She paid me for it and I thought that would be it. But then she asked me what the kids ate with me after the week had ended and then she wanted to know how I got her kids to eat a full meal.

Her kids are picky eaters. They are typically the kids who will eat what they like off a plate (meat and potatoes, rice or noodles) and then leave the rest (veggies, sauces). According to my sister and BIL, even if you give more veggies than something else they won't eat them and they'll wait until their next meal and if you give all veggies or insist they eat the veggies before anything else, they'll skip the meal. I sorta knew that about them before I babysat so I blended veggies and other good stuff into their dinner the first day with me and the second day I served them but I did them but hid them in plain sight and on the last day I just served them in a way they don't get them normally and because they knew they had them they ate them without an issue.

But they wouldn't eat them for my sister or BIL after. There was some back and forth between us and I shared some recipes but my sister said she couldn't get them to eat the food. So she wanted me to make food for her kids every day. I asked if she was going to pay me for spending all that time and money and she told me I should do it as a way to help my nieces and nephews stay healthy. I told her it's a big ask. She told me I have the chance to really help and put my skills to good use for family.

I feel like it's asking a lot because they expect me to make something every day for the kids. But my sister feels like I'm being a bad brother and uncle.

8,1gly7jy,AITA for ignoring my best friend who's struggling with a lot of issues? ,"For context, I'm (20F) and my friend, ""Zey"" (20F), met three years ago on Twitter. Since then, we’ve been best friends, chatting non-stop from morning till night, sharing every detail about our lives. Zey has really come to rely on me and trusts me with everything.

Here's the issue: even though she loves and depends on me, I’m feeling completely drained and overwhelmed by her and I don’t know if I can keep being her friend. Zey is the most pessimistic person I’ve ever met. She turns everything into a huge problem and constantly complains, expecting me to comfort her and give advice. I’ve always tried to be but no matter what I say, she either finds more problems or does nothing to change her situation.
Her negativity has become unbearable, and though I feel bad for it, I hate when she messages me, hate listening to her problems, and hate that I’ve started avoiding her. But it’s also complicated.

 I’m also dealing with a lot in my own life and have even failed classes because all my time and energy go to supporting her. If I don’t respond in an hour, she calls me everywhere, demanding my attention and explanations. It’s reached the point where I’ve started ignoring her for a few days at a time, making up excuses about my phone or whatever. But during those days, she fills my DMs with trauma dumping messages and just waits for me to come back.

Yesterday, she was calling and messaging me at night, saying she’ll k word herself, that she needs me, that she’s not okay begging me to respond and to help her ( because her dad didn't allow her to persue her dream major) and I felt nothing. 
 this morning I checked my notifications and I found out he accepted with some conditions but she's satisfied and happy and she deleted her mentalbreakdown of yesterday.

I feel a little bit bad now for not helping her but there isn't much I could do

AITA for ignoring her? I do care about her deep down, but I feel like I’m drowning in her problems and just can’t take it anymore.

 PS -We live in a third-world country, so mental health resources are pretty much non-existent here.
- she absolutely wasn't going to hurt herslef I assure you all.
- I don't blame her for the things that happened to me

They refused to do anything about it and let it become a huge problem (they're everywhere - beds, in the walls, furniture, in the carpet, etc). My sisters and I were forced to deal with them also, which has left me with major PTSD. 

When I was old enough to leave, I got my own apartment and made sure to not bring any bugs with me. When my younger sister asked to live with me, I was hesitant because I knew my parents still had bedbugs, but nonetheless I instructed her on how to clean/steam her items and allowed her to move in. Thankfully no bugs transferred to my apartment.

Although my sister is very aware of my parent's bed bug issue (that they refuse to do anything about), she refuses to place any boundaries with them as I have. She continues to give my mother rides in her car (although my mom has her own car), she occasionally goes to visit my parents at their place, etc. I told her that doing this places us at risk of getting bedbugs. She already knows about my PTSD. My sister doesn't see it that way and thinks I'm just being overdramatic and trying to keep her away from the family. AITA?

So a few weeks ago my dad had a pretty bad crash. He's 52, so his bones are different than mine and he unfortuantely did not break his fall well. He got 9 broken ribs, collapsed/broken lung, broken collarbone, and head trauma.

For context we ride a lot, usually through mountains, although we didn't crash going downhill, my dad was still going fast (30mph) when he crashed. I had fell seperately around 1 1/2 years ago, I only suffered a concussion (although it was worse than Dads) and was discharged within 12h. My dad was admitted to a hospital for a little over a week and now he's in a rehabilition center which will help him walk and get back to normalcy.

When he was in the hospital, family members from all around the country flew in to see him, and his sister seeing him in a unconscious state (post concussion you sleep A LOT) was enough for her to GIVE AWAY (with mom and grandmas permission) all 3 of MINE AND MY DADS BIKES. For context my dad was riding a SL7 Tarmac and I was riding a Caledonia-5. Including my old bike I'd say we lost at least $10k that we could have made selling them. It isn't the money though, both of my parents are well off, that's why they could afford it in the first place.

My dad is currently in no position to do anything about this decision, so it just leaves me here to pick up the pieces .So I'm wondering what yall think of the situation, I personally think my Mom/aunt/grandma have no authority over a hobby they deem ""dangerous"", especially given I'm an adult. At the same time almost losing your husband/brother can't be easy at this age.

Before anyone asks no I'm not going to go after her, the bikes are already gone, and making a bigger deal of it to her which at this point she can't do anything either would just be silly. I live with my parents so they can still pretty much control me even though I'm 18. In community college and I live in a high income area so I can't just survive off min wage once I do start working too.4",Not the A-hole,2024-11-07,"AITA for not accepting Mom throwing out my bikes after accident?

When we met(let's call him Tim) we had more conversations then I could shake a stick at that I did not want children for a variety of reasons and if we stayed together I was open to adoption but would actively prevent having a kid. I had plans to get my tubes tied once I could find a doctor who would.
We eventually married and I became pregnant(despite being on the pill and using condoms)with our oldest, and it was around the time we figured out the gender I saw a side I never had before. Suddenly Tim was going on and on how he was the last of his name and blood. How everything was going to then fall on our son and he'd be carrying the weight of the whole family etc He first wanted him to be a Jr which I declined because while I liked his name didnt feel it was for our son, Tim then wanted his middle name to be used either as a first/middle name because him, his dad, his grandpa and a handful of other men in the family passed that name down either as a first/middle. Tim kept pushing and ignoring any suggestions I had, even when I brought up they were important people from my family line (I never wanted the names but I wanted to know where he stood about names on my family side. He made it clear none of them were important even saying as much because it wasn't how blood/names were passed down according to his family)
It caused a ton of fights. It eventually came around he wouldn't be there for the birth of our son (long story and not something I've ever held against him / blamed him for because I know the why and it wasn't anything we could control). I flat out told him help me decide a name we could both live with or I will pick and you won't have input because you won't be there.
He begrudgingly agreed to a random name but over the years had no issues throwing it in my face and starting random fights over it because how can our son carry the weight of the family if he doesn't have the family name(mind you our son had Tim's last name)
I don't think I would have minded using the name as a middle name if the conversation had been simple ""hey it'd be cool if he had the same name as me/dad/Grandpa and XYZ"".

","augh i feel horrible that i actually have to type this out but i just want to know if my frustrations are valid

I (16F) have had this arrangement with my parents that if i do my chores every month i will get $25 This includes doing the laundry, dishes, and sometimes also sweeping the floor I have diligently been doing them basically every day i could except for a few days where ive been bone exhausted from school (im a part of the IB Diploma and try super hard to get straight 7s / A\*) So yeah there have been a few days where i havent been able to do said chores but because of that my parents are refusing to pay me my monthly allowance

My dad just told me today that if i teach my sister everyday after school he'll give me another $50 in return So at first i thought this would be great bc ive been saving up and it would really help me out to get $75 per month rather than just $25- but heres the catch-

My parents are actually really horrible at paying me previously- ive been doing this for a while but they keep on refusing to pay me- for my september allowance they straight up didnt pay me until mid-october during a festival where its customary to give some money for good luck- strictly speaking the money i got during the festival should be unconnected to my sep allowance but i didnt rlly care much at the time bc i was just glad to finally be paid

And today where my dad just offered me the $50 and I pointed out that he didnt pay me my oct allowance and I didnt want to take up the extra offer and waste another hour of each day teaching my sister because frankly some days i have a 9 hour school day + 2 hours taken in public transport from going to school and back Thats 11 hours of my day just in school and i already have my own homework to do

So logically I pointed that out and asked for him to pay me the $25 from my oct chores first and guess what- my dad said he already paid me for october- I asked when and he told me that what he gave me during the festival was my oct allowance and what the fuck- not only was the money i got there NOT supposed to be from my allowance BUT THE FACT that he claimed it was my oct allowance rather than my sep one-

He claimed that since he gave it to me in oct it counts as the oct allowance- EVEN THOUGH it was his fault for not paying me in sep and paying late So now im honestly considering refusing to teach my sister because i dont want to waste my limited time and now when i brought it up hes saying that if im going to be so picky about it i should just pay my tuition fee myself and pay rent and cook for myself etc- so genuinely am i the asshole here?

TL;DR my parents are offering $50 per month for teaching my sister + the $25 i get for doing my chores but i refused to accept their offer because theyve had a history with not paying me and due to my immensely busy schedule i already wont have much time to teach her and i dont think i can trust my parents to pay me / compensate me for the time i spent teaching her",Not the A-hole,2024-11-07,"AITA for refusing to do my chores after my parents told me that they wouldn't give me my allowance that i would get doing them?

We live in a two room apartment in Paris that is 35m2. And have been here since the second Covid lockdown. We both work from home and from the beginning he claimed a large portion of the living room by buying a large glass desk that takes up much of the room. He gives French language classes online. On days like today, he had four classes going on. When he’s on a call I can’t walk into his screen, therefore I’m limited to the bathroom and bedroom.

I understand that he’s busy and stressed, but I also work full time and need to be able to come into the living area / kitchen when he’s working. To have lunch, make myself a warm drink, and just generally take intermittent brakes from working. 

My desk is significantly smaller and in the bedroom. One could argue that I need more space for my job than his, since I’m a data analyst and often working on two screens is an imperative. I have a second screen but can’t get a larger one that would be more efficient due to the bedroom space constraints. He has a nice, big screen that he got for himself, which he uses for music production. He often uses it between working hours too so I don’t really have any opportunity to use it.

This arrangement is causing me significant distress, but when I ask him to take calls from the bedroom he hardly agrees and if I push firmly, like I did today, he gets upset, throws a mini tantrum before agreeing (often using words like “shut up okay I’m going”). As one might imagine, i ask less and less for fear of disrupting the household peace. 

I thought this would get better since we discussed This issue at large over the summer, and occasionally since he has agreed to work in the bedroom for individual calls, but it’s still far from the equality I’m expecting out of this relationship. Is it reasonable for me to demand we split days 50/50, even though he technically bought the desk and screen in the living room? Should I try and impose a rule like: all calls are taken from the bedroom, unless we have calls at the same time? 

Final note — the living room/kitchen is more spacious, and has nice lighting and the sound of birds out the window, whereas the bedroom is smaller, has poorer WiFi connection, faces a small courtyard, captures noice from the street, poorer light, same place as where we sleep, no access to facilities for snacks and drinks, etc.

Update: thanks for all of these comments! They game me fuel to instigate a chat this evening. He could see that it was serious and asked me to wait until he has dealt with some emails. Meanwhile I was reading all the comments and getting emotionally worked up. I think that helped to hammer it home to him how important this is for my mental health. The chat was calm, though I got a lot of pushback from him. In the end we agreed that I’ll get the desk most of tomorrow, and for the rest of the days we’ll see on a case by case basis. I asked to put in a schedule but he said it’s too confusing with his classes changing all the time. I also reminded him that he needs to watch his reactions and be kinder.

I'm talking with his friend after me and this friend broke up a while back. We were hoping to hang out maybe at his house or the beach or something and so his friend asked him if we could hang out. His response was ""as long as A doesn't go"" Which I was confused by because nothing happened that he wouldn't want me there so i asked his friend to ask him why. Jaiden said he had no idea why i couldn't go he just didnt want me there. So I left him alone for a bit but I knew there was something going on.
Eventually I decided to message him myself. I said ""if you can't even tell me what i did then why are you mad"" to which Jaiden responded ""I'm not mad"" and I said ""then why did you say I can't go to your house?"" and all he could say was ""idk"" he then made up an excuse to why he couldn't talk and left me on delivered. I talked to his friend and he said that jaiden texted him ""A is just yapping to me rn"" About an hour or 2 later he messages me ""I'm done. what are you yappering about now."" and i just asked him the same question and all he did was send stupid pictures. i told him i was serious and i asked why i wasn't allowed to hang out.
at this point, i didn't even care about hanging out
with him i just wanted to know why he had a problem with me. and he said ""because you're mad annoying... you're getting pressed."" then he sent more silly pictures of random people and then i said ""for someone who's smart you don't really act like it""

17,1glu5za,WIBTA if I stop paying rent because of my disgusting roommates ," I am a 25 year old female that recently moved into an apartment with two other girls (26 and 29) , not really knowing them, I asked the previous tenants about the cleanliness. He said that the apartment was usually much cleaner but it was currently in a state of slight chaos due to everyone moving in and out.  In reality I should have known better, but that was the one thing I was very concerned about and he assured me everyone was very clean. 

Issues started when I moved in. It took 2 months for the apartment complex to get the lease together, and this is where I may have been the asshole, because I refused to sign the lease. The reason being is because the roommates ended up being disgusting. They were lovely girls and we got along, but the cleanliness was a major issue. I grew up poor with my mother being a hoarder, so I tend to keep my areas clean and if I don't I get very stressed out. A little mess is fine, but not to the level it was at.

When I say disgusting, I mean rotten food being left out for days, bags of cat shit on the floor, piles of boxes spread in the living room because they refuse to unpack, bong water spilled everywhere, etc. The worst part about it is that I have cleaned the apartment after them for months. I stopped, and then they complained that the apartment was not clean. There was fights after fights. They would just make excuses about being depressed or having plans while I would literally clean with a broken back. I could not enter the kitchen without gagging because of the cat shit.

Now because of this, and because of the fact that I am conserved, my conservator could not justify paying rent in a place with unlivable conditions. So she moved me but because I did not want to screw over the other girls I asked her to pay double rent while I find someone to take over the lease (I have substantial savings). She agreed.

I told the girls that I will be finding a new Roomate and that the house needed to be kept in a condition where I could show the house. I even offered to get the place professionally cleaned and pay for it. So far they are refusing to clean the apartment.

So right now as it stands the house is not up to livable or showable conditions, meaning I cannot find someone to rent out the place, and even though I have savings, it is unfair to be paying for a place that I was essentially forced out of due to these conditions. They even tried to use my room as storage, and still make me pay for it.

Now because I am not on the lease I checked with the apartment and I am under no legal obligation to continue to pay rent. Will I be the asshole if I just stop paying?

Update: thanks everyone for the reality check. I took a step back and realized that I was being taken advantage of and screwed over. And it while it hurt hearing that they really done care for me based on their actions, it’s something I needed to hear. To cover any legal bases I have emailed the apartment my 30 day notice. I will also as a courtesy let the girls know about my decision and then well, move on.

Lots of things changed in both our lives recently and I no longer have the space for him. The shelter lied about him being cat friendly. He is flat out terrified of cats and I have 2. So he's been just staying in my bedroom while the cats roam the rest of the apartment. It is a small one bedroom apartment. I recently had my bro and his gf come drop off a cat to me about a month ago that I don't believe they are coming back for and also turns out she is pregnant. Not bsfs problem, but now I have an extra mouth. While I love this dog so much, it has become too much for me to handle mentally and physically to be able to properly care for him and the lack of space is becoming too much having to play gatekeeper with him and the cats in my apartment. So her and I had talked about it and agreed he would leave for a little while because of the lack of space as we were planning on living together. But in the last couple of weeks things have drastically changed for me and this is where I might be the asshole. My ex-boyfriend had recently come back in my life and thinking about trying again but was going to take it slow and still live with her as that was my plan. But then he got kicked out of his previous living situation. And he didn't have many options to go anywhere that he could have his animals with him. So now I have added another dog as well as another cat that he had acquired during our time apart for the dog as she needs a cat in order to thrive, so it’s the dogs cat. His dog is also my dog as we got her together almost 4 years. But I have also now added another person as well. So l have informed my best friend that I needed him removed a little quicker than anticipated due to these circumstances. She was very understanding even tho I feel as if our relationship has some tension. But she spoke to her roommates and they said they were okay with it but changed their minds later in the evening and texted her kind of passive aggressive about it. the way their apartment works is they rent out their rooms and share a common living room and kitchen space. She never crosses paths with them to begin with as they have complete opposite schedules and see each very little. He would strictly be in her room and only come out to go potty and he's okay with that. He's a lazy dog and prefers to sleep and lounge. Even taking him out he does his business and prefers to go back inside rather quickly. He just likes to be around her. They are saying they feel disrespected and changed their minds. And while ESAs aren’t really service dogs, but as far as the fair housing act goes he is a service animal and can't say anything about him moving in.

19,1glt563,AITA for arguing with my sister about a wheelchair ,"I (50F) had an argument with my sister (45F) about a stair climbing wheelchair she guilted me into purchasing for my wheelchair bound dad.  They were coming to visit but staying at a hotel as my house is not wheelchair accessible and making it accessible would be prohibitively expensive.  There are ~8 steps to both my front and back doors and only one bathroom on the second floor of my small 100 year old house.  I told her I was OK if they cancelled due to the accessibility issues, but she insisted on coming.  She had me spend $600 on a stair climbing wheelchair which I did not think my dad would use.  It sat in my driveway for almost a week when my dad, big surprise, refused to use it.  I told her she needed to take it back with her as they live on the other side of the state.
When she was talking about packing up their stuff last night I reminded her to take the wheelchair and she replied, no, that is going in your basement.  I told her no way is that fucking chair going in my basement as a constant reminder of the $600 I wasted on a practically immovable chair as it weighs almost 70lbs.  I told her take it home and have my dad use it there, have her bf sell it and try to get some of my money back, or throw it out there.  I just didn’t want it in my house.  She took all her stuff and stormed out of my house and is now not speaking to me.
 
As some background here, she is my dad’s primary caregiver since he had a major stroke back in February.  She was out of work at the time for cancer treatment (since completed) and quit her job to move in with him (next door to her house).  I have been supplementing her income since then and have given her ~$4-5k and gave her $200 this week to spend while she is in town.  I have also gone out to visit seven times since my dad’s stroke and pay for everything while I am there, including almost $400 on dinners while I was there last time.  She called me in hysterics a few weeks ago because her cat needed surgery, and I agreed to pay for that as well.  This chair was the straw that broke the camel’s back for me.  I have a good job, but I am single and live alone in a 100 year old house which desperately needs work.  She lives with her bf who works out there and is driving a car that her bf’s mom pays for.

20,1glt0hn,AITA for not having the time of my life at a conference while pregnant?,"A few months ago my boss (who also happens to be a great friend - emphasis on this, as she always wants to be friends first before she’s “just my boss”) invited me on a roadtrip/ conference somewhere warm and beautiful. 

This would be the first length of time (24+ hours) we’ve spent together. And we are sharing a room the whole time (6 days). 

Today is the last day. 

Obviously I said yes - this would be alot of fun together. I’d also never been to a conference before, I had no idea what to expect. 

The road trip was *amazing*. We had so much, lots of laughing and memories.

Conference came along, and first day was going good. We networked/met with some people we emailed often and it was really nice. 

Now - I’m half-baked (almost 20 weeks) pregnant, and I’m exhausted and uncomfortable alot of the time. 

I usually woke up pretty “blegh”, and not very energetic. I’m also like this most days in general (while pregnant). Shes very active and a walker, and I’d always kinda be slugging behind on our way to talks. 

There was an awesome party at the end of it, and I didn’t wanna stay too long cause my legs were getting kinda swollen, we were on our feet for a while, and also I can’t drink. (I’m very social and mingley after a drink or two). 

I said I would go back to the room early. She came with me, didn’t have to. 

Anyway - for the last two of those 3 conference days, she just kind of ignored me. She gave quick answers to all my questions, I tried to make conversation, but always quick answers. She always walked ahead of me. Basically never looked at me. 

She knows I’m pregnant obviously, and she’s always been very compassionate (up until now) about my “condition” lol

 At first I thought maybe she was just getting tired from the trip too. But then it went on for the rest of the trip. 

Finally, when flying out of the city, she says “Almost there! Sorry your trip sucked.” In an annoyed tone

And I was like, “what? What do you mean? It didn’t suck?”

She smirked and was like 🤷🏽‍♀️ 

When we got back to the hotel, I asked “Why do you think I thought the trip sucked? What did I do? You seemed quite annoyed with me.”

“It seemed like you would have rather been anywhere else than there, and it bummed me out. I hope it wasn’t a waste…. For you.”

(They paid for the trip obviously, so while she tacked on “for you”, I’m sure she meant a waste of money for them.)

I texted my husband about this, and he said “that sucks, but I guess remember that she’s your boss before your friend”. 

Thats true, but she always ensure it’s the other way around. And if it were boss first case, shouldn’t no emotions be attached?

That being said, *it was* a conference. Tired slug isn’t really the best vibe for networking… maybe I should I have tried harder to be more professional. Though again, we have similar demeanors, and I think we did about the same amount. She wasn’t smiling and shaking hands with everyone either.

21,1glspqb,AITA for sharing my opinion with my brother and warning him about his wife unprompted?,"My brother (36M) and his wife Emma (35F) have known each other for the best part of 2 decades. They were in the same friend group toward the end of high school and lost touch after graduation for a while, but ended up reconnecting when the larger friend group reconnected. Then Emma moved away and they lost touch again. In that time my brother got married and had his kids (11M&9F). Emma moved back about 5 years ago and started spending more time with the old friend group, my brother included. Though they didn't seem to get closer until after the death of one of their shared friends. 

My brother's marriage to the mother of his children was never super great. It only got worse when the kids were no longer babies however and they separated 4 years ago. Their divorce was finalized a little over two years later.

Before the divorce was finalized my brother and Emma started dating. They broke up briefly and got back together but Emma's attitude toward the kids mom was incredibly negative around the time of the breakup and remained the same after they got back together. Emma and my brother got engaged fast and then my brother's ex, the kids' mom, died. 

The kids weren't happy about living with Emma and less so about Emma trying to step into a motherly role for them. They know how she felt about their mom and with her gone the loyalty pull was stronger and the dislike for Emma more intense.

My brother and Emma's wedding day was a shitshow and the kids protested the whole way through which my brother was aware of but he said they'd been okay with Emma before (as in before he dated her) so they were just protesting him being with anyone who wasn't their mom.

Emma is jealous of the kids mom. She's jealous the kids still love her. She still hates their mom for reasons I don't know. The kids know she hates their mom and they use it to taunt her. They tell her almost every day, if Emma is to believed, that she'll never be as good as their mom and they will never love her or accept her because she isn't good enough. They compare Emma's cooking to their moms, they compare the way she decorates, stuff like that. I know they do it. But I also know Emma has kicked up a fuss about the kids keeping their moms things and having them in their bedrooms, as well as having photographs of her. Which if you ask me anything is likely the reason the kids are so quick to compare the way they do. The household is toxic. Emma's jealousy of their mom grows and the kids dislike for Emma grows. My brother acts like things are fine and he's burying his head about the growing issues.

I decided not to ignore it and addressed this with my brother. I told him Emma and the kids are not getting along and her jealousy is going to make his home even more of a living hell than it already is. And I told him I did not think Emma could come back from her jealousy and warned him that she could cost him the kids. He told me he didn't ask for my opinion and to mind my own business.

My brother acts like things are fine and he's burying his head about the growing issues.

I decided not to ignore it and addressed this with my brother. I told him Emma and the kids are not getting along and her jealousy is going to make his home even more of a living hell than it already is. And I told him I did not think Emma could come back from her jealousy and warned him that she could cost him the kids. He told me he didn't ask for my opinion and to mind my own business.

22,1glqtwa,AITA for not cooking my roommate dinner?,"I (28F) have a roommate (27NB) roommate. We are best friends and have lived together for a couple months now, for some context. This happened last night, my roommate called me to talk about their day and how it was super stressful which is fair. They spoke about how they didn’t want to have to do anything when they got home so I mentioned that my partner would be over and we were gonna offer to cook them dinner anyways so it’s perfect! They asked “what’re you cooking”, I say “grilled cheese and tomato soup!”. They then said “well what kind of grilled cheese” - my partner makes the best grilled cheese with cream cheese and then we will just pick other random cheese or two to go with it - I explain the type and they said “that’s doing too much, what happened to simple grilled cheese. It should be just bread, butter, and a single cheese”. I explained how no it’s actually so so good and mentioned a dive bar that they know of that has a 7 cheese grilled cheese so it’s normal to get creative. Moving on, they ask what kind of tomato soup, “like a can of Campbells?”, “no, it’s a tomato, butternut squash and pumpkin!” To which they respond “white people are always doing too much” (we are white, this is just a joke). 

Anyways, they then changed the conversation and never said that they wanted dinner so I assumed they didn’t want any. My roommate got home later that night while my partner and I were eating our - very delicious - dinner. To which they exclaimed “you didn’t make me any??”, I said “no, you didn’t seem very interested in what we were cooking” 

They said it was all a joke but was visibly and energetically upset and asked if there was any left. So I told them there were plenty of ingredients left if they wanted to make some themselves.

23,1glqf16,AITA for going to my sister's place after my dad's wife was rushed to the hospital?,"A week ago my dad's wife, who's 7 months pregnant, was rushed to hospital after she started bleeding and having issues breathing. My dad's ILs were at the house at the time visiting their daughter and grandkids when it happened. My dad went with his wife. I (17M) went to my sister's (22F) PLACE instead of staying with dad's ILs and his stepdaughter (10) and other kids (3 and 18 months). Dad's ILs wanted me to stay with the kids so they could go to the hospital to make sure their daughter was okay. I just wanted to get out though and I left without discussing it more. I ended up spending three nights with my sister before dad showed up and demanded I go back to his house.

For context about why I didn't stay and dynamics. Sister and I are full siblings. Dad left mom when she was pregnant with me. After he left mom he got a job driving trucks and wasn't around much. Then he moved an hour from us and started seeing us more. Then he moved even closer and tried to get equal parenting time but since he hadn't taken all the time he was offered before, never paid his child support and didn't have a place big enough to give us our own rooms (and wouldn't give up his bedroom for one of us) he was turned down. He ended up getting married, becoming a stepdad and having more kids with his wife.

Last year my mom died and my dad and sister battled in court for custody. I wanted to live with my sister. The courts said my dad should get a chance since he never really had much time with me. They said my sister was too young to really support me like dad could. I protested it but it didn't help.

I'm going to live with my sister as soon as I turn 18 and we have a plan for that. Dad doesn't know but keeps trying to make me forgive him and give his family a chance and to try and be a family with them. I'm not interested. Not in his kids either. He tried to sell me on being an older sibling until he realized I don't care about his kids. His wife decided if I didn't want to give them a chance then she wouldn't let me have any photos of my mom or sister in her house. I gave them all to my sister. She even went through my stuff to see. Ever since she reminds me almost daily that I'll regret not wanting anything to do with her kids when they're older. She also wished for my sister to end up homeless because my sister didn't want to know her kids either. Oh, and because she had gone to court to make sure dad was going to still pay the child support for her that he never paid mom.

Back to the current stuff. After my dad made me go back to his place he yelled at the top of his lungs at me for abandoning ""my family"" and for not showing more concern for his wife and the unborn baby. Or for the kids who could have lost their mom for all I knew. He told me he deserved better than that. I told him he deserved nothing from me or my sister. He told me my actions showed I'm not growing into a man but a pathetic little boy.

24,1glpvhn,AITA for putting a lock on my bedroom door in the apartment I share with my husband and his family member? Sorry it’s long.,"My husband and I live with his sibling, “G,” in an apartment that’s paid for by his family. G frequently brings friends over, and one of them, “L,” is a frequent guest who practically lives with us at this point. I tend to avoid the common areas because I get anxious and uncomfortable around so many people, but I don’t really mind keeping to myself.

I have a vanity room where I keep my clothes and jewelry, and I installed a small camera there for peace of mind, as no one locks the apartment door, day or night, and I wanted to protect my valuables. Later, I decided to put a lock on the vanity room door as an extra security measure.

Recently, while my husband and I weren’t home, G allowed their friend L to enter our personal space without permission, supposedly to charge a device. This was especially unsettling because my husband and I have private, personal items in our bedroom, and it felt like a serious invasion of our privacy. I feel that G was also at fault here for allowing a frequent guest to enter such a personal space, especially since it’s our private room as a couple.

After that incident, my husband and I decided to put a lock on our bedroom door for additional privacy. I even explained to L beforehand that it was for privacy and safety, given the constant traffic in our apartment.

Everything seemed fine until G texted my husband, angrily accusing us of being “paranoid” and saying locks and cameras aren’t necessary because they were “raised with trust” as a family. Since then, G has been distant, and I’ve been avoiding G and L, as I feel like they’re both upset with me. I tried to reconcile with G, but they were dismissive and rude, leaving me feeling like I was back in school dealing with bullies.

It’s especially hurtful because I had opened up to both G and L about some personal struggles, thinking they would understand why I’d want some extra privacy. Now, I feel like I’m an outsider in my own home.

26,1glp97e,AITA for spending Christmas with my bf's instead of my SO?,"So, there is a little backstory about an Advent calendar, and him not feeling appreciated because he didn't get one. 
So now I'm unsure if I should agree with him because I already made him feel underappreciated for Christmas in another way, but here comes the next problem:

I (still 22f), have a bf (still 28m). Normally (last 4 years of our relationship) I spend Christmas with my family, but I finally had the balls and stopped that (long story, not important, they aren't nice people).
This year however, because I do love Christmas, we decided to do a little secret Santa with me, my 2 best friends (if important one m one f), little sister of female best friend and SO and mother of male best friend.

It's supposed to be our little self made family, everyone we love in one place, I'm hosting and making the food with best friends mother, I love decorating and everything above anything. Little presents, self made sweet almonds etc pp.

Now the problem. My SO is invited (of course) cause he is my family. I offered that he can also bring someone (he has a brother for example). 
He thinks it's not okay from me to make Christmas a big thing without him in the center, he feels under appreciated by me making a big fuss with my friends and him feeling like an ""afterthought"".

After I already posted here about him feeling under appreciated bc of an Advent calendar, I now feel like I should be more open to him feeling not appreciated at Christmas, but I'm at a loss at what to do.

I did make him a little Adventcalendar after it was the topic of our last argument with 24 reasons why I love him, and he and I talked about why he was jealous before, he made one for me too because he understood I also feel unappreciated when he wants everything and doesn't give it back. 

But now I already did invite him, and I'm again at a loss and hope reddit can help me out, I did try to talk to him that it's family for me, and he is a part of that, but should I have spend the first Christmas without my ""blood"" Family with him instead of my friends and him?

I’m suffering major cognitive dissonance right now with no idea how to reach him. Grew up in a two parent household with a very absent father. 

Yesterday I brought up how a friend of mine whos father left when she was a kid, was valid for feeling resentful and not wanting to forgive her father back into her life after her father came back wanting a relationship with them. My father, who’s been uninvolved in my life only until recently (getting old and suddenly sentimental for family) got mad and said that she’s being vengeful and cruel for rejecting her father who’s asking for a relationship with them again *just because her father wasn’t there before*. He claims that the absent father must have had an epiphany and realised his mistake. My dad most likely took it personally because he’s starting to realise now that me and my brothers (all adults now) are closer to mum than him, and he’s been feeling excluded. I try my best to stay connected to him but honestly we have weak roots. 

I called bullshit on that and stood my ground - that that there’s no reason for her to ever forgive him since he left in their time of need (girls growing up without a father, mother was low income too) and time of weakness (being bloody little). He got mad at me, picking up that I also resent him for similar actions. 

THEN. he blames ‘feminism’ for ‘instilling these family destroying ideas’ and says that the universe will punish me for supporting the idea of fatherly neglect and that I’m an individual with ‘a narrow soul’ because me and the girl don’t have it in us to be the better person and forgive. I treat him cordially and respectfully. He’s still my dad. But I’ll be honest to say that I don’t have it in me to love him the way he wants me to love him - and he fails to see that that’s hurt me my whole life. 

I said that men, as fathers and husbands have a responsibility to provide for their children. Both financially and emotionally/mentally, you know, love, experiences, a bond! I told him that the girls in a better place now since she’s married to an amazing man whos taking care of her and is in tune with her and her needs, fulfilling what her father didn’t  and he got mad at me saying that it’s selfish to only love a man because he’s providing something!

I said ok. He brought up again, and this time he mentioned a friend of his ex was going, &that made me feel some type of way but I let it be out of respect for his daughter.

She told him he should take me and give me my place as his future wife in his family. I joked and said ""he didn't invite me because his ex doesn't want me there"" and He avoided the comment, all he said was ""its going to be my ex 1st time going to Disney, shes never been there"" I let it be, moved on from it. 2 months later he brought it up again, I asked questions like who's all going etc. He said my daughter, both my parents and my ex is going. I said ok. He brought up again, and this time he mentioned a friend of his ex was going, &that made me feel some type of way but I let it be out of respect for his daughter. He talked about it again today, said he wants to go fish out there, plans to stay longer with his dad. While his mom, daughter, his ex and ex friend will come back sooner. I then said ""oh more people going?"" he said yes,  &that his ex's sister and bf will be meeting them up there. I couldn't stay quit any longer & asked him why wasn't I invited? Since there seems to be a lot of more people going? And he told me he asked his ex if I could go & she said no, I asked why did she say no, & he said she just said no & she doesn't want to meet you. It hurt my feelings, and I told him its very messed up for him to exclude me if he wanted me to be there, that his ex should suck it up, and that if he really wanted me there he should of stood up to her and let her know what he wanted. I understand it's his daughter's birthday trip and it's about her, but I just felt excluded from something important in his life that I wanted to be apart of. I guess I was wrong to assume of being included and now he is mad at me because I made it a big deal & is says he wont go. He should still go, all I wanted was to know why he didnt invite me. Now I feel horrible and wondering if I crossed the line w/voicing my feelings",0.0,1.0406739,1,0

She said a mild one (shit) while 3 young kids 5-12) were around. I said she shouldn't do that as kids were around. She initially said it's not a swear word, then agreeing it was but then saying the kids probably knew it anyway and then saying I should care about what she wants more than what others think.

I said I found it rude to swear in front of kids so please could she try not to say it for me. She said she doesn't want to be restricted and if I care for her I should let her speak the way she wants and shouldn't worry about what others think.

I said I personally don't want to be around her in public today if she's not going to at least make an effort not to swear in front of children. She then went home and I continued with errands. AITA for this?

31,1gllsow,AITA for calling my friend beautiful?,"At college I had a big group of friends, but one particular girl I was super close with. After graduating, I moved abroad and ended up losing touch with the group, but always stayed close with her. I always made the effort to visit her when I was home and she even came out once to visit me.

Cut to 3 years ago and she was dealing with the loss of a parent. We chatted on the phone and she talked about how exercising was becoming a big thing in her life. I can't remember our exact conversation but I remember saying ""sometimes when things feel out of control, our bodies are often the first thing we want to control."" At the time, one of my other close friends was dealing with body dysmorphia and, on reflection, I maybe said that without explaining the context of what I had been discussing with her lately.

In the months following our phone call she began posting pictures of her body online, graphs of her heart rate during gym sessions, and publicly sharing her calorie intake. I didn't really take much notice until one post in which she shared a graph of her weight over the last few years circling sections where she gained a little weight or lost it. For context, C is not large or was ever unhealthy. Honestly, the social-media posts worried me as a female who has watched a number of her friends struggle with body image.

So I stupidly messaged her with, ""I think you're beautiful.""

What I woke up to the next day (time differences) was a barrage of messages saying I was condescending, rude and judgemental. That I've never tried to understand her, and that if I didn't accept her life then I wouldn't be a part of it. I quickly apologised and that I never intended to hurt her. I didn't try to explain myself or make excuses as I know that undermines a genuine apology. Another bout of angry messages came at me. When I didn't immediately reply, more came. At this point, we had been friends for close to ten years and I had never had an experience like this with her.

I sent a fairly long message apologising again. However, I called her out on giving me an ultimatum and that's a shitty thing to do to a friend, that her aggressive language was not okay or normal. I also said that she was creating drama where there was none, and implied this was not the first time (not personally with me, but she's had some falling out with friends in the past which I always thought could have been avoided). I then asked if we could end the conversation.

Since then we haven't spoken. I've muted her online, but I occasionally see her posts. I think she's become a personal trainer now. Recently some big personal events happened in my life and part of me wished she could have been there as we genuinely went through a lot together when we were young. I've grown apart from certain people before, but never lost a friend as a result of an argument and it plays on my mind.

32,1gllklq,AITA because I kicked someone out of my house after inviting them to stay with me?,"I’m going to try to include as many details as possible without being too obvious- I’m also using a throw away account to keep anonymity. 

A while back in July a friend of mine (23f) who I had known since 4th grade reached out to me (23f) telling me about her current life situation and how things were moving along with her baby and school. During the conversation she talked about needing to get out of her living situation desperately and leaving overnight the second school was done as her mom and her were at odds. She mentioned needing a place to stay and asked if I would be willing to have her stay with us for a bit if nothing else panned out, I told her I would need to talk to my fiancée (26m)- but it was a very possible yes. Fast forward a few weeks and she lets me know she won’t be needing a place to stay bc she found a guy who is going to let them live with him… okay cool great! Womp womp they get there and the place is filthy, he had drugs on the table and it’s just not a safe environment for baby. Immediately I jump and say they can absolutely come stay with us for a a month or two till she can get a job in her field and a place for her and baby. They drive down immediately and move into the guest room and everything seemed fine at first. 

Slowly though things started to fall apart, it was always small asks from us and nothing crazy, like hey can you rinse the bottles if you leave them in the sink or do you mind putting your purse and stuff on the hooks or on the clutter counter so it’s not everywhere? I would bring it up if it seemed to be slipping but not in a nagging way just hey if you could try to remember it would be really helpful for us. This continued fine till I started to notice things staying in her room that were household items, like laundry baskets or dryerballs, for multiple days at a time. She had very little things and I even bought more stuff for her to use at our house, but I never gave them to her, though I would have if she asked. Then one day I was trying to do laundry and I couldn’t find any of our baskets so I told my fiance to ask if we could have them back for our clean laundry and she said sure, a while goes by and again we ask her but she’s going through and folding and placing all of the clothes on the bed- I ask again hey our laundry is done can I just have the basket for a second? Yeah sure give me a few minutes. Okay. Then again in a few minutes so finally I went in and gave her a different basket to use that we would normally use for things like dirty towels just to make it so she had something else to use while I used ours. Then we noticed her lying about weird things, from mental health to where things were or whether or not her son broke something. Things that again I wouldn’t be upset about if you just found them or told me about it. Ex, her baby knocked over one of my plants and instead of letting me know she just shoved all the dirt back in the pot and pretend it didn’t happen till I addressed it and asked where all the little propagations went. She looked me in the eyes and said “the only ones that were in the pot are there, he knocked out some dirt but not the plants.”- this is a weird ass lie bc I know how many propagations I had going, I’m trying to grow a bonsai. 

These things just kept building up and she continued to not keep up the small tasks that are just common courtesy. She quit her only source of income as well by this point bc of things I won’t say- and decided to take a cleaning job instead. So, I told her that I was giving her a 30 day notice and I didn’t want it to affect our friendship. I want to still be your friend and I don’t want you and your baby to be out on your asses I just thinking giving you a timeline might help streamline your success. 

Then it fell apart. Idk when or where but along the way things got weird, she was again lying about weird things like having looked for something that I had to personally go find. Then she moved in with a guy and messaged me for over a month that she would be coming back to the house to stay and pack her things a little and then go back and forth like that. But she never did, so eventually when we got to day 23 or so of 30 days I messaged and was like girly you need to come pack up a little bit. Not all of it but like put your things together. 
She comes over and starts packing, I go in and chat with her when I notice she’s got some baskets of mine- I said, you can keep the things you’re leaving here for now in those but when you leave you’ll have to put them into a different bin bc I’ll need my laundry baskets back. She looks me in the eyes and says “the black one? I brought that with me and you gave me the white one”- remember that basket I shared with her earlier in the story? Yeah it’s that one and she’s looking me in the eyes telling me she brought it with her. LIKE WHAT!? This time I stood my ground and said, no, those are both mine I did not give them to you, but I have been letting you borrow them since you have been staying here and I know you needed a place to put stuff. “I don’t remember it that way, but okay just keep them”- at this point I’m kind of thrown off, flabbergasted to be honest. Then she mentions to me she has some of my towels and sheets back at the other place she will bring them back okay. 

Next day I ask her if she would bring them by just bc I know she doesn’t exactly have a move date and I know she may do it sooner rather than later. Comes by, drops of the sheets, no towels. I probably should have cut my losses but she was still using my guest room as free storage and I wanted my towels back, call me psycho. I message her hey where are the towels? 
Oh I thought I had some but I don’t. 
Are you sure bc 2 of my big bath sheets are missing? I don’t usually lose things like towels bc they don’t ever leave the house… 

Then silence till I get off work. I messaged her again, did you get the chance to double check for the towels? *crickets* 
I’m really just wanting them back bc rn it’s seeming like they aren’t anywhere else
 I’m just going to check your room to make sure they didn’t get put anywhere in there. 
I found one of them in your packed vacuum seal bag… were you just going to take it? 

Oh sorry I was busy. That’s weird, could have sworn it was just my blanket and my towels. 

At this point I was livid and I know I know, it’s just small objects- but I had already been letting her use all of my things, not pay rent, help with childcare, etc. and it felt like she was shitting on all of that by just not caring and lying and trying to steal in weird ways. 

So I gave her one more message after that. You know what, I don’t care, you can keep it. Good luck getting the rest of your shit. 

Which I’ll admit wasn’t the most mature response, but I had a week left till her 30 day notice was complete and I just couldn’t do it anymore. 
A week later I unblocked her and texted her that all her stuff was on the driveway and to just come get it before anyone else did. She came and got everything even mail that got to our house all shoved into her bags. 
I find out then that she had made a video calling me her insane ex roommate who stole from her baby… omitting all details except those which really do make her look like a victim. Idk maybe she is- I’m struggling with deciding if because this was not an isolated incident and a build up of things that I consistently attempted to communicate about means my end reaction makes me an asshole. None of my friends or therapist think I’m being “insane”, but the comments I read on the video made me question if I really did act completely crazy… I’m not normally one to worry about internet trolls, but seeing someone say I should seek professional help, and the response being “this is how she acts WITH professional help” really hurt. 

I still left out a lot of details but I was trying hard to give the best synopsis…?

33,1gllec8,AITA for not paying bills to my parents?,"I'm 18, as of last April, and ever since I graduated highschool I've been trying my damndest to move out with my cats. I have two friends I'm trying to house with, but because it'd be three people plus pets plus fees and deposits, etc. etc., it's proving to be incredibly difficult, and I can often not get a straight answer on how we're going to progress with getting a place (and we actually lost to time to an apartment I absolutely loved and wanted, unfortunately, so we have to start from the beginning all over again.)

I've been saving up, rarely actually spending money on myself unless it's getting something from the gas station I work at, and I get paid- as of last paycheck- $12.50/hr, my stepdad gets paid over $20/hr, and I'm unsure exactly what my mother makes, but I'd assume $13-$15?

A few months ago, mother tells me that as of October I'll be helping out with the bills, saying she's going to do some math things- I can't remember exactly what she said- and will average prices for me to pay for bills, which I called her bluff on and she never did although that isn't the point. 
It's November now and the other day she asked when I was going to ""start helping out,"" which heavily implied the bills. I told her I didn't want to, how to me it felt unfair as I'm her kid and am still trying to get my own independence. She bites back with ""so you expect to buy these video games and then just use the electricity to power those video games?"" I didn't have a rebuttal admittedly, not wanting to get into this argument. I have a steam deck, a switch, and a desktop computer but I haven't even set it up yet, which is what she was referring to when talking about video games, I'm guessing.

Other than bills, groceries, and wifi (of which i hardly use), and a rare vet bill, anything I need/want I pay myself. My phone, spotify, amazon, therapy, you name it, if I want anything I pay for it myself, however I'm incredibly stingy with my money, afraid of spending too much.

She's told me that if I pay, before the mini argument paraphrased above, it will help me budget for when I live on my own. I go over every thought out plan, at least mentally, over and over and over again. While I will never fully know until I get hit with bills, I have a very good idea of what I'll be faced with.

When mother first brought this up, I went to my oldest brother for advice, and he suggested for me to make a contract, of sorts. Should I just do that and deal with paying them until I can finally move out? It feels like a waste. I help with chores, step father doesn't at all, just pays for bills and his own things, and mother pays him some money to help with bills, and she pays for groceries and their phone/wifi bill. 

I'll also note that I've offered to pay for anything the cats need, food, litter, etc., of which was turned down. To me, paying for bills now will put me further back, money wise, to be able to move out.

When I first signed the lease for these suites, my best friend at the time was just starting out her beauty business. I offered to let her use one of the rooms for her business. i said if she would help me manage some things in the salon I would let her occupy the room rent free. She accepted. 
Later she offers to have her dad do the construction work for me. She says that she will make sure he gives me a good rate in order to help me out. I was hesitant. I already had a contractor i trusted, but she insisted so i told her okay. He then came and gave me a quote of $6000 for the whole renovation. I agreed to it. 
4-5 months after the salon has opened, said friend begins to complain about her managerial responsibilities. her responsibilities were not anything major. The main thing was keeping the place tidy and she was only responsible for the common areas which is the hallway and waiting area. At this point, it also becomes clear to me that she seems to think that this salon is as much as hers as it is mine from certain actions/comments.
to top things off, she posts my spare chair for rent on ig without my approval. When I come across the post of the chair, I let her know that she cannot do those things without my approval. She starts going off on me on how she is the only one that cleans the salon and how i don’t do anything for the salon
At this point, it is clear to me that this arrangement is not working out. about a month later I tell her that in order to make boundaries clear, She will no longer be responsible for anything other than her own room, but she will now have to pay rent just like the other girls. she says no. She says if it wasn’t for her, this salon would not be possible. She says that her contribution to the salon was having her dad help out with the construction. She then shows me this contract, which i had never seen before, that says that the work her dad did would have been $18.5. so until all of that is paid back she will continue to stay there rent free. She says either i let her stay there rent free for another 2.5 years or she can move out but wants nothing to do with me 
I thought that her having her dad do the construction was her helping me out as a friend. She never told me that we would be exchanging rent for her dad’s labor. And to me, regardless of everything going on, our friendship was never on the table. 
At about the year mark of the salon opening i tell her that I would love for her to stay, but i cannot continue to let her stay there rent free. she says in order for her to leave I would have to pay her dad at least 9k, half of what I “owed” him. she even implied that I would have to give her some money to help her find a new space to work? i told her this wasn’t an argument and that she had 30 days to move out or 30 days to come up with the rent for the following month. she moved out and told me to never contact her again",Not the A-hole,2024-11-07,"AITA for trying to make my friend pay rent?

35,1glk8c0,WIBTAH if I reported my roommate to the dorm managment.,"I (19f) am living in uni dorms. Our dorms have two rooms, one for three people and one for two that share a hallway and batroom. 

I stay in the two people room, while this girl B, is staying in the three person room with two other people.

The two other girls end their week on wednesday so they go home. This is when B invites people over to her room to party. Without the two girls knowing or giving her permission.

If it was 1-3 friends it would be fine, but usually it's 5+ people. They are being loud, blasting music, yelling, running in and out of the room and slamming the doors etc. Which makes it VERY hard for me and my roommate to sleep. 

When they finally leave for the club we get a bit of peace and quiet but not for long. Everytime she comes back absolutely shitfaced she wakes everyone up. Usually around 3-4 am. 

Once she invited about 7 people over, while one of the other girls was there, trying to study. She didn't ask if it would be okay or anything, people just started showing up.

Other than that, she is very messy, she floods the bathroom everytime she showers, she never helps clean the room etc. 

So WIBTAH if I reported her and possibly had her kicked out, or moved to another unit?

Only a few hours later the fire alarm went off in my apartment complex with what I thought was burnt toast... turned out to be a full blown fire on my floor.

My mom does not live with us and called me a bit after I texted her.

Then she started talking about her day at school and how her student were sick and kept going as firefighters literally broke windows and the managers ran into building to check if people were left (turns out some almost didn't leave as they were disabled)

Today she called me and tried to discuss yesterday. I told her I was still sick and she was shocked ""wow you do have the flu!"" To which i rolled my eyes and said yes I'm not sure why you don't believe me sometimes. She dismissed everything I said about how I said it happened. I tried to get her to apologize or least acknowledge her discussions were not great timing and she refused, instead deflecting and telling me it was ""my fault"" because I told her I have the flu and when I have any health issues it makes her upset.

I (M/28) have been dating my girlfriend (F/26) for around 8 months. Things are generally good, but there’s one big issue that’s causing tension between us – she constantly brings up her ex. Like, all the time.

At first, I didn’t think much of it. I understand people have past relationships, and I’m not the jealous type. But it’s not just once in a while – she’ll randomly bring him up when we’re having dinner, watching a movie, or even when we’re with friends. She’ll say things like, “Oh, my ex and I used to come here,” or “He used to love this kind of music.” It’s starting to feel like he’s a third wheel in our relationship.

A few nights ago, we were out with some friends, and she mentioned her ex again, saying something like, “He used to make the best spaghetti.” I finally hit my breaking point and told her (probably more bluntly than I should have) that it was making me uncomfortable, and I’d appreciate it if she didn’t bring him up so much. She got really upset and said I was being insecure and trying to “erase” her past. She insists it’s normal to talk about exes casually and that I’m overreacting.

Now, she’s giving me the cold shoulder, and I’m questioning if I was too harsh. AITA for asking her to stop talking about her ex, or am I just being petty and insecure?

EDIT: Just to clarify, I’ve never made a big deal about her ex until now, and I’ve tried to be understanding.

40,1glibk2,AITA noisy neighbor rant.,"I (31F) live in an apartment with my husband (29M) . We moved in together in March and tied the Knot in May.  For context our apartment complex is a pretty quiet area.. well it was. We live in the upstairs unit adjecent to our  noisy neighbor. There is a section of stairs that divide us but it's a really small area.  Anyway, our neighbor let's call her Val. (22-25F) she moved in to the complex in August. Previous neighbor had moved and it was 2 months till she moved in. 

I met Val the same weekend she moved in.. being physically that close and her accidently taking my package while moving in boxes. ( I get it things happen) anyway . In that encounter Val had asked my Husband and I if we were loud, He responded not really, she also shared that she would be working nights and sleeps during the day. 
After a week or so she made new friends or brought some over and, we noticed that Val is always playing loud music. I mean its okay during noisy hours.  (Per complex rules no loud noise after 11pm on weekdays)  By loud I mean speakers blowing her singing extra ( she has a nice voice).  Honestly this is especially fine on the weekends.   But she and her buddies be turning up on a Monday and Wednesday. I personally feel bad for our neighbors below her as I can hear the music and her and her friends walking around.  She and her friends be having gatherings at the weirdest times.  After 11pm a d be blasting there jams. She claims to live alone but always has a different roommate  monthly. (Possible update on another post). I noticed that prior to the ring cam her buddies would constantly knock her door till she would answer at times the knocking would last about 3 minutes. 
There was an instant when the knocking was about 5 minutes and I opened my door and gave the guest a mom stare. ( sorry not sorry but at 1am in the AM,  I need sleep.for my work day)  this was a thrusday. 

I am not trying to have a confrontation but other neighbors have asked her to lower the volume  in the recent months. I don't know if I need to be the neighbor to tell her to lower the volume once again or at this point call security. It gets so loud sometimes my tv doesn't block the sound. 
 
So AITA for wanting to tell her to lower her volume?  And be courteous of the area. ?

42,1glh8iu,WIBTA if I reject my mom's plans for MY body?,"My (20M) mom (38F) recently came back from a year long journey away from all of our family due to my grandma passing away, and right from the get-go she told me I put on some weight.

Ever since I begun working in the city, I've been eating out every other day and even got into a pizza frenzy, and i'll admit: my body has seen better days (current height: 166 cm weight: ~80 kg).

But in my defense, my physical performance is as good as ever: I constantly walk 3 km daily back and forth towards my work (6 km daily total) and somehow i don't grow tired from sprinting here and there.

Anyways, today in the morning my mom went on a tangent on how i'm slowly killing my body and how I should hit the gym already because my weight already has distributed correctly in the right places (whatever she meant by that). I paid no mind to it and went to take a shower, and when my aunt went to the kitchen my mom broke into tears, saying how she thinks I ate too much because on the inside i felt lonely without her (I didn't) and how I'm actually depressed (not likely), because those are the reasons she gained weight when she was my age (a single mother, mind you. kids are not in my book, i can't even get a girlfriend).

Once I put a foot outside the bathroom, she pulled me into a hug and told how i'm ""not alone anymore"" and how she wanted me to eat fiber, protein and yadda yadda yadda. I just nodded and went on my way, a little frustrated by the whole exchange.

44,1glgq4o,AITA Cowroker keeps touching my to do list,"For context, I (33F) work at a small clinic as an administrator. I adore this job to pieces and I find it to be quite fulfilling and rewarding over all. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 6 years old. Over the years I’ve learned how to adapt existing tools and structures (such as calendars, colour coding, organizing, and so on) to help fit my needs so I can function in my day to day life. And one of the things I like to use are to do lists. Years ago I used to have an ex boss who thought my diagnosis was made up, and she would go out of her way to find any notes, lists, or memos I made for myself to help me do my job, and she would throw them away even after I told her not to touch them. As a result, I’m rather protective of my ADHD tools. 

 A few months ago, I came into work to find that my coworker had made me a reusable daily to do list containing all of my daily duties, and it can be wiped down and reused over and over again with dry erase markers. I was moved to tears by this and as a result, my work output has improved quite significantly! This new tool has been a huge game changer for me. But there’s been a little bit of a problem…

There have been a few times where this coworker would make changes to my to do list without asking me if it was ok for her to do so. She would add more tasks, change the wording unnecessarily to try and “tidy things up” or “give more details” (which I don’t need), and there was one time I came in and she completely redid the  whole list so it “looked nicer”. I have to be honest, I was really upset. I found my original to do list and put it back in my cubby. Since she made the list for me, I have had to remind her not to modify my to do list without asking for my permission first a few times already. I don’t touch her stuff. I don’t see why she has to touch mine. My coworker has said to me that she “has to do it for herself or it will drive her nuts”. To me this feels like a violation of not only my work structure, but my personal property.

Today she modified it again without asking me and I had to put my foot down with her. I’m at the point where I think I need to start hiding my tools again. And if she does this again, I will be reporting her to my boss.

We then figured out, after further discussion, that her parents wouldn’t let her go unless we were with her brothers, who had tickets on the other side of the stadium with a really bad side view in the nosebleeds. She said we would have to offer our well-centered seating to someone else in the bad view to stay with her brothers, or she couldn’t go. I didn’t want to do that, so I told her I wouldn’t be giving up my great view for nosebleeds. She began complaining about me being a bitch for it, since I don’t listen to Tyler that often anyway, so it shouldn’t matter to me. I told her that regardless of the artist, I want a good view to be fully immersed and enjoy the experience. Plus, she doesn’t know the group configuration around us. What if someone next to her brother is there alone and the next person is a huge group? I’m just supposed to go sit on the other side by myself? Not happening. After some back and forth, I told her I’d do it since she kept bugging me but only if the people trading paid what we paid since the difference was about $60 a ticket. She said that we aren’t doing that because it would make the people switching say no.

I took my time getting my soaps, towel, wash cloth, and other shower things organized in the bathroom. During the entire 15 mins of me being in the bathroom, the baby was crying so hard that he was losing his breath.

I thought it was really strange, because in the country we live in, a minor traveling alone by plane to another country is kind of unlikely. But, it's okay.

48,1glge71,AITA for being mad that fiance gave brother the wedding venue I loved?,"Backstory- I was engaged 11 months before this situation and looking for the right venue. On a trip I fell in love with a venue, and said to my fiance out loud that we should look at it. The Brother in law heard me say this, then pulled my fiance aside and said that his girlfriend wanted to get married there and if we could get married there after them (I found out about this convo weeks later). Keep in mind they weren't engaged yet, but supposedly the girlfriend wanted to get married there since she was 12. So then when I emailed the venue my fiance told me about the convo and said if I really want to... But it was said in such a way that it really wasn't an option.

I think of my life with my fiance as separate then his family. We are our own unit with little overlap of friends. In addition, after that comment it wasn't really if I could use the venue or not, it's that I could have it after them. So I then had to wait for their wedding and another year in between at least because the family lives abroad and cant make big trips like this twice a year bc time and money.

How am I supposed to know that venue wasnt allowed? My heart was set on it, but now my fiance thinks I'm the crazy one to think they took it from me because they had ""dibs"" on it sicne she was 12 and wasn't engaged.

In addition, my fiance didn't defend me to his brother during a conversation about it (which I'm finding out about now). Instead of saying ""hey she loved it and imagined her wedding there and you asked a brother favor from me, so you can see why my fiance would be mad that she didn't get her wedding there and you should understand that"" and instead said ""I don't agree with my fiance and she's crazy to be mad that I promised you that you could get married there first"".

Now I'm mad that my fiance doesn't defend me and called me crazy, or see my side of the story, and to me it seems like he chose his brother's happiness over mine. Then my fiance is mad at me for making a big deal out of this when he said it was their venue first.

I think of my life with my fiance as separate then his family. We are our own unit with little overlap of friends. In addition, after that comment it wasn't really if I could use the venue or not, it's that I could have it after them. So I then had to wait for their wedding and another year in between at least because the family lives abroad and cant make big trips like this twice a year bc time and money.

How am I supposed to know that venue wasnt allowed? My heart was set on it, but now my fiance thinks I'm the crazy one to think they took it from me because they had ""dibs"" on it sicne she was 12 and wasn't engaged.

In addition, my fiance didn't defend me to his brother during a conversation about it (which I'm finding out about now). Instead of saying ""hey she loved it and imagined her wedding there and you asked a brother favor from me, so you can see why my fiance would be mad that she didn't get her wedding there and you should understand that"" and instead said ""I don't agree with my fiance and she's crazy to be mad that I promised you that you could get married there first"".

Now I'm mad that my fiance doesn't defend me and called me crazy, or see my side of the story, and to me it seems like he chose his brother's happiness over mine. Then my fiance is mad at me for making a big deal out of this when he said it was their venue first.

53,1glegri,AITA for not visiting my sister who is 2 months PP with her first baby? ,"Hi all. My (26f) sister (37f) just had her first baby two months ago. I was always there for her during all her pregnancy and labor, we were always very very close much like best friends.

When she was pregnant she used to make comments about my body (i’m a gymrat), about how skinny I am, that I didn’t look good anymore that I’ve lost my boobs, ass etc. I actually feel pretty comfortable in my body so i brushed that off. Comments got more frequent and it started to feel weird but mom always blamed it on her pregnancy. Several times i told her i didn’t feel ok with comments on how lean I am. I never made comments about how she gained weight - though she was constantly asking about it.

I was at her labor but now that baby is born i’ve not visited much. I assumed she wanted to spend alone time with her baby and husband since she was also getting lots of visits from family members. I’ve visited like 5 times in 2 months and got my baby gifts but she is now deeply upset about it and says I barely even see them. I’ve also been busy with life and work on my side but deep down I feel those comments and her bugging me made me feel different about her and now I don’t feel the urge to see her as frequent as before.

I also didn’t know I was overweight until some of you guys let me know. I know there are some things I can work on to be healthier so if you have any tips please let me know!",0.0,-0.01473751,0,1
