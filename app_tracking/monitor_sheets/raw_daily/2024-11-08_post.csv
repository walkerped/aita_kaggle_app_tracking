0,1gm7rd8,AITA for changing my name despite my dad not wanting me to?,"Ok, so, I’m not gonna work too hard on this post but I just need to get it out somewhere.

I am a teenager. I used to have a very pretty name. It was based on my great grandmothers name. For the sake of anonymity I will say it was Jasmine.

During middle school I did a lot of self exploration and I’ve found that my gender isn’t exactly linear. I am unable to put it into simple words on a Reddit post at the moment but in short it’s kind of ineffable. For a while I went by Daniel (not really but again, anonymity) when I found myself in a more masculine aligned state. Now I go by a unisex name. I’ll use Alex. I didn’t really bring up Dan much to my dad but he used to get very upset when my friends called me it and would demand I change it. He used to say it was “too masculine” or “disrespectful” to my mother (who doesn’t care and is/was very accepting) and my great grandmother (dead) 

Obviously this made me feel terrible about many things. 

When I moved onto Alex he was more accepting because it wasn’t as much of a “boy name” (imo names don’t have gender. They’re words. We respond to them. That’s it.) and he even calls me by it. So he’s trying. Keep that in mind. However, every so often he’ll say things like “Every night I pray to god you’ll give up on this ‘Alex’ thing and go back to Jasmine”. He’s not even religious. 

That’s basically the whole thing, but I’ll say this: my name is an intrinsic part of my identity and my gender as a trans person. Him rejecting it and telling me he wishes I’ll go back to the feminine name that I feel deeply uncomfortable with and like the real me is hiding or being pushed down when it’s used feels like he’s rejecting my identity as a trans person. As me. Like he wants me to be someone im not. It eats me alive constantly. 

His reasoning for being upset is that he feels like my name is a part of our bond as father and child. He feels like it’s something we share. He gave it to me, so it’s a little bit his.

I feel like it’s mine. He also said that he should be allowed to express how he feels to me because all feelings are valid. I always feel so deeply and incredibly hurt and rejected when he expresses how he feels and I think it should be your job as a parent to be supportive of your child’s emotional needs. On the other hand I think expressing how you feel, even if it’s a bit taboo should be something everyone should be able to do. I just don’t think it should me he comes to.

Ps. If you’re going to make a comment please don’t make it about my gender being complicated. Please don’t comment on my identity in a negative way. Please don’t say anything about how young I am. I know. I know. Stay on the topic of the subreddit. Any transphobia will be thoroughly ignored by me and if I remember the rules correctly, likely deleted.

So, AITA for changing my name and not liking how he handled the situation? (& telling him that)

1,1gmpoke,"AITA for not inviting my partner's ex to our wedding, even though they have a child together?","My fiancé (34M) and I (31F) are getting married soon and we're finalising the guest list. He has a daughter from his previous relationship and we're trying to include her as much as possible. The issue is his ex (her mother) who expects to be invited to the wedding. For context, me and my finance have the daughter for most of the time, her mother gets her maybe a weekend a month. She's a nice enough person but she has a lot of problems with drinking too heavily, and then becomes a less nice person. 

While I understand that she's an important figure in our daughter's life, I'm just not comfortable with the idea of her there at the wedding. From what I know, she's not made steps towards stopping with her drinking problem and I can only imagine what kind of choices she would make at the wedding and I don't want the stress of that on the day. She and I have had a pretty good relationship for the sake of the daughter, but there has been some tension and disagreements in the past. 

For instance, when she came over drunk before and said that she wanted to see her daughter more, that I'm pretending to be her mother etc. I can understand where it's coming from and she is nice, but she ultimately has problems that she's not willing to confront at the moment. I've tried to talk to her about it before, more for the daughter's sake but she just brushes it off even when she's sober. I want our wedding day to be about me and fiancé, rather than any potential awkwardness or drama. 

My fiancé wants to keep things amicable for our daughter (and he also has a feeling that his ex is already annoyed that we're getting married; and this only got worse when she realised she wasn't invited) but understands my feelings on it. His ex has already expressed her displeasure about not being invited and I'm worried that it will create more issues.

i've been bullied by my peers, and i truly believe my requests are valid. this teacher also expects the students to respond ""bonjour"" when he calls attendance, and i do not. i guess he was at wits end after all the conversations about my problem, and he screamed at me in front of the entire class and kicked me out to guidance. 

i am VERY aware it's hard to judge a student's ability in a language class if they do not speak, but it's just speaking in front of people that im unable to do, i've even asked to present projects and speaking evaluations after classes. which, as expected, he said no to. 

im stuck with this, my peers agree with me that he's taken it too far, not even mentioning picking on me as a joke in front of the class. when i explicitly asked him not to do that. 

i did have his wife who isn't actually french, as my french teacher a few years ago. she respected my requests and was super sweet to me.

I told her mom that I would consider it and not to buy a ticket for me yet.

8,1gmm85u,AITA? Yelled at a guy in the parking lot,"Here’s a relatively tame story compared to some of the wild things I’ve seen on here.

This morning around 6:45, I stopped by my local grocery store to grab some food before work. The parking spaces there are angled, making it easy to pull in, but they do follow a one-way traffic flow. I went up one lane and pulled through a space so my car’s nose was facing the driving lane—technically facing the 'wrong' direction. Since it was so early and the lot was practically empty, with literally hundreds of open spots, I figured it wouldn’t be an issue.

As soon as I parked, though, I looked up to see a guy pull up nose-to-nose with my car. He started gesturing for me to back up and let him have the space, despite there being two open spots to my left and right. I just looked at him and shook my head slowly. He then reversed, parked in the space to my left, rolled down his window, and shouted, 'What the fuck are you doing, dumbass? You’re parked the wrong way!' I replied, 'Fuck you boomer there are 10,000 open parking spaces. You don't need this one that badly!'

He got out, threw one final 'Fuck you' my way, to which I replied with 'Eat my asshole, old man!' and we both went inside, in opposite directions.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole here?

EDIT: Just so this is clear, because based on some comments it may not be. I was very obviously in the spot well before him. I didn’t like cut him off as he was going to it. The car was parked before he even pointed the nose of his car at mine. I beat him there by at least five seconds. He saw me in the ‘wrong’ place to park and wanted to start a feud. 

2nd EDIT: The lot is not clearly marked as a one way. It’s just an unwritten rule that the slanted parking spots are supposed to be going one direction. People go the opposite way all the time. Not to mention I would definitely have gone (and did) the right direction when leaving ",Everyone Sucks,2024-11-08,"AITA?

I went up one lane and pulled through a space so my car’s nose was facing the driving lane—technically facing the 'wrong' direction. Since it was so early and the lot was practically empty, with literally hundreds of open spots, I figured it wouldn’t be an issue.

As soon as I parked, though, I looked up to see a guy pull up nose-to-nose with my car. He started gesturing for me to back up and let him have the space, despite there being two open spots to my left and right. I just looked at him and shook my head slowly. He then reversed, parked in the space to my left, rolled down his window, and shouted, 'What the fuck are you doing, dumbass? You’re parked the wrong way!' I replied, 'Fuck you boomer there are 10,000 open parking spaces. You don't need this one that badly!'

He got out, threw one final 'Fuck you' my way, to which I replied with 'Eat my asshole, old man!' and we both went inside, in opposite directions.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole here?

EDIT: Just so this is clear, because based on some comments it may not be. I was very obviously in the spot well before him. I didn’t like cut him off as he was going to it. The car was parked before he even pointed the nose of his car at mine. I beat him there by at least five seconds. He saw me in the ‘wrong’ place to park and wanted to start a feud. 

2nd EDIT: The lot is not clearly marked as a one way. It’s just an unwritten rule that the slanted parking spots are supposed to be going one direction. People go the opposite way all the time. Not to mention I would definitely have gone (and did) the right direction when leaving ",2.0,1.064695954322815,1,0

This morning I was out back with my dog at approx 7AM (the best way to approach me in the morning is to not) and all of a sudden a young woman poked her head over my tall back fence and said ""HI!"" then proceeded to tell me it was her frisbee, it was brand new, so she wanted to come get it.

10,1gmlrra,AITA for telling my FIL that he's a shit father?,"So I (27F) knew my husband Rowan (29M) for a while before we even dated; we grew up in the same town and we were good friends through school, so I met a lot of his family etc when I was a kid. We lost contact for uni but then kind of talked again after and have evidently dated and got married. When I was a kid I always kind of thought that Rowan's dad was weird - I obviously didn't have much context for it then - but I always thought it. His mum passed away when Rowan was young & he has one older brother (40M) but obviously the age gap meant that they weren't very close for much of his childhood. 

I know that when Rowan was a teen he acted out, drank a lot with his friends, got into fights, didn't have good grades. I don't doubt that he was a difficult kid to raise, but I always thought that he was a good person (and still do). When we started dating he told me about the reasons behind him acting out - that his father was always drinking or out, that he constantly told Rowan that he wasn't good enough, that he was a shit son etc etc, accused him of sneaking out/unprotected sex/drugs, constantly tore apart his room looking for incriminating things. Rowan's changed a lot now and is a genuinely down-to-earth guy that would help anyone that asked. 

Him and his father don't really speak anymore. This was mainly due to a huge argument they had when Rowan was about 18 and his dad said that his mum would be really disappointed in him if she was still alive, that he was never going to amount to anything. Rowan told me after that he packed his bags, stayed with a friend for a while and hasn't particularly spoken to his dad ever again. 

Rowan and I went back to the hometown this weekend to see my parents, and me and my mum went out to a bar for a catch up. I immediately recognised his dad because he has a bunch of tattoos of random things on his neck and whatnot that I remember looking at as a kid and he was standing next to me at the bar. We made eye contact and he looked surprised, and said something to the effect of 'I heard you and Rowan got married. I'm surprised, he's always been a skirt-chaser. Thank god he doesn't speak to me anymore'. 

I repeated the sentiment that I was glad they didn't speak anymore but added that it was because he'd been a shit father. He got very defensive, saying that Rowan had been difficult to raise and whatnot, and I just turned around and left to go and sit back down with my mum. I kind of pity him but I wish I'd just not even spoken to him and left it. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-08,"AITA for telling my FIL that he's a shit father?

11,1gmlo9m,AITA for calling my brother a lazy asshole who needs to grow up and get a job?,"I (19f) have a brother (26m) let's call him mike.
Mike has sufferred through depression, and he is on medication. He has a BA in computer science and is looking for a job.
I too have sufferred through it. The problem is my parents didnt care.
To make this post brief and not too long; I tried to confide in my parents but they just laughed at me, and yet a year afterwards my brother did the same and they helped him through with everything. This was 3 years ago. And since ive been seeking help without the knowlege of my parents.
Recently I suggested to my parents to get a PS5, me and mike have always wanted one, and they agreed to pay for it.

The problem is, I got a job a month ago and I rarely play anymore, and since, mike has decided that he wants it in his room. Because according to him its not fun to play in the livingroom where there are people in the kitchen coming and going.
So he bought a computer screen and headphones and has been playing with his friend literally everyday, although he is supposed to be looking for work.
I tried to voice my frustration because this ps5 isn't his alone, and yet nearly anyone i talk to about it says that the PS5 can be easily connected and disconnected from the computer screen to the tv.
And yeah it can but its not fair , just because im not home alot doesnt mean its ok to have it in his room, and it's kinda annoying that everytime i want to play i have to disconnect it, move the entire set up and connect it again to the tv.

We had a huge fight about it today when I involved other family members and amidst the fight i said:
You're (mike) a lazy asshole who needs to grow up and get a job, this is not your playstation nor is it mine. So putting it in either one of our rooms is a childish move.""

Everyone said that I was overreacting and completely rude. I feel like Im 9yo again fighting over a toy, its so frustrating that nobody can see my POV🤦‍♀️
So am I the asshole for saying that?

12,1gmlgpk,AITA for telling my husband that he needs more discipline?,"My husband started running about a year ago. At first, he did it for the mental health benefits, but then he got really into it. He's done 5k races and wants to run a marathon eventually.

I'm truly proud and supportive of him. The thing is, he's constantly talking about wanting to get better and faster, but he doesn't take care of his nutrition.

Yesterday, he was supposed to do a hard training session, but he had too much to eat and said he felt ""heavy"", so he did an easy run instead. When he told me, my first reaction was saying ""you should have planned your meals better"". 

Now, I know I can be too blunt and not even realise. I honestly thought I was being helpful. He was upset though and said he was already sad for not being able to follow through the training plan, so he just wanted some support.

I immediately apologized and cheered him for not giving up and still doing a 5k run at a good pace. It didn't turn into a fight or anything. 

However, I believe he needs more discipline when it comes to nutrition, otherwise how is he supposed to run a marathon? This isn't about weight loss at all, I just want him to eat healthy so he can practice an endurance sport in a sustainable way. But he gets upset when I bring it up. Am I wrong? If not, how can I better approach this?

FINAL EDIT: I feel like I need to give a little more context. I plan my individual meals and our shared ones, and try shopping for healthy food. He's actually the one who keeps bringing in junk food.

I'm not sure why people got the idea that I'm trying to coach him or prescribe him a diet. He keeps complaining that he feels too full when he overeats, or too weak when he doesn't eat at all. All I've ever said is that he should plan his meals according to his training schedule. I never said I would take over and do it for him.

As for my overtly blunt remark, I'm autistic and struggle with communication skills, which he already knows. That's why he stated exactly what he wanted from me at the moment and I corrected myself. I'm only mentioning this to clarify that my main concern was my communication. That's why I asked how I should have approached the situation, because I know I was rude and I'm taking full responsibility for it. Literally, I'm asking for advice on how to do better, that's the opposite of making excuses. 

Anyway, thank you everyone who's advised me on how to be more gentle and understanding.

16,1gmjpcz,AITA for asking my landlady to pay me for the ice cream her grandchildren ate and the notebook her grandchildren tore?,"For a little context, I am a student in my last year and I live off my savings so I don't have much money, I rent a room near the university, in that place I live, the lady who rents it to me and 2 other university students, like this that only adults What happened: this lady's grandchildren are visiting (They are 3 children between 7 and 2 years old) we normally leave the rooms with the door open because there are few of us and there is trust in the others in the house, now with the children everywhere, I left the door closed (no key), I came back tired in the afternoon and felt that there was something out of place in my room, like that feeling that someone moved something and that person tried to make it look like it didn't. 
I got a little nervous and asked my best friend (who rents another of the rooms) if he had come in, which he denied and I believed him, then I saw a bookmark on the floor, I decided to see in the kitchen if there was anything of mine and I found under a table a notebook of mine (very special for me since it was a birthday gift years ago from my best friend) with a cute cat design, now it was all dirty, torn and unusable.
The lady who rents from me saw me almost crying because of it (I did feel stupid for crying but stationery is special to me and gifts even more so) and she offered to pay for a new one but that one is discontinued... I decided to rest and after a while eating ice cream (which I bought as a luxury because my mother had sent me some money) and I NOTICED THAT THEY HAD EATEN ALL OF IT (1 liter of ice cream), now, the lady doesn' I don't know that I noticed about the ice cream, but today I want to charge her for it, and go buy some notebook. 
I feel like it's rude of me to charge for that but I don't have enough money and the fact that they eat my things and break my things makes me feel very frustrated... (and yes, today I left the door locked) 

UPDATE: Everything went well, I spoke to her and it was all misunderstandings and good intentions, in fact as soon as I arrived she asked me if I had found a replacement for the notebook... she even gave me a plate of homemade food (as a student that's worth gold) Thank you all for your responses I felt a bit rude about it since I have a soft heart when it comes to children. 

Regarding privacy, which I understand is an issue (for me too), it is something discussed and I know that the children were scolded and before that even warned not to enter. Luckily I didn't have any really dangerous things at children's height (like medicines or scalpels... which I use to practice nursing techniques)

I got a little nervous and asked my best friend (who rents another of the rooms) if he had come in, which he denied and I believed him, then I saw a bookmark on the floor, I decided to see in the kitchen if there was anything of mine and I found under a table a notebook of mine (very special for me since it was a birthday gift years ago from my best friend) with a cute cat design, now it was all dirty, torn and unusable.
The lady who rents from me saw me almost crying because of it (I did feel stupid for crying but stationery is special to me and gifts even more so) and she offered to pay for a new one but that one is discontinued... I decided to rest and after a while eating ice cream (which I bought as a luxury because my mother had sent me some money) and I NOTICED THAT THEY HAD EATEN ALL OF IT (1 liter of ice cream), now, the lady doesn' I don't know that I noticed about the ice cream, but today I want to charge her for it, and go buy some notebook. 
I feel like it's rude of me to charge for that but I don't have enough money and the fact that they eat my things and break my things makes me feel very frustrated... (and yes, today I left the door locked) 

UPDATE: Everything went well, I spoke to her and it was all misunderstandings and good intentions, in fact as soon as I arrived she asked me if I had found a replacement for the notebook... she even gave me a plate of homemade food (as a student that's worth gold) Thank you all for your responses I felt a bit rude about it since I have a soft heart when it comes to children. 

Regarding privacy, which I understand is an issue (for me too), it is something discussed and I know that the children were scolded and before that even warned not to enter. Luckily I didn't have any really dangerous things at children's height (like medicines or scalpels... which I use to practice nursing techniques)

17,1gmiswi,AITA for asking my boyfriend to quit his sport? ,"UPDATE: are people not seeing where I asked him to stop PLAYING? He can coach, mentor, watch, etc. that is okay. It’s the overwhelming amount of injuries, money spent (and then screaming at me that I’m the reason he’s broke) that made me ask him to stop PLAYING. 

I (23f) have been with my boyfriend (28m) for about two years. He has played rugby for the entirety of our relationship and started about a year before we met. Rugby is the third person in our relationship, so I asked him to stop playing. Was I wrong?

Every Saturday “is rugby day” where he wakes up- watches a game- plays a game with his team- and then watches another game after- usually followed up by highlight reels on YouTube until he goes to bed. He has a two hour practice every Tuesday and Thursday. He coaches a highschool team. He assistant coaches a college team. 

After every game, practice, scrimmage, etc. he comes home with some sort of injury or is just in general debilitated by pain. Covered in bruises and cuts. He has been to the hospital for a separated shoulder, a split open eyebrow, a split open lip that went all of the way through his muscle and fat, and the most recent was he got a bunch of turf beads in his eyelid and was almost blinded (not exaggerating) by it. 

He will take off work for games and practices, he will cancel dates for games and practices, he will miss important events for games and practices. My family home caught on fire- we had a fundraiser- HE TRIED TO SKIP IT FOR A GAME (the game got cancelled so that’s why he showed up). We were out to my birthday dinner and he asked if we could rush it so that he could make his practice after. We can’t go out and do anything on a rugby day, we can’t have sex on a rugby day, he can’t function on a rugby day.  And his excuse is “it’s tough on rugby days”…. well his “Saturday is a rugby day” has turned into every day is a rugby day. 

He gets stressed out financially because where we live is extremely expensive. But, he has money for new cleats, new studs for his cleats when they break off, tape for his joints for games, team memorabilia. Basically, he has money for rugby like an addict has money for his fix. 

I want to say I’m glad he has something he enjoys. I’m glad he coaches and that his students look up to him and that it makes him feel good about himself. We’ve both met some incredible people through the rugby community. 

But, the phone calls at 1am that he’s in the hospital due to an injury, getting yelled at because he’s broke, having to cater to him whenever he plays because he’s sore, consoling him when he’s bawling his eyes out because he lost a starting position and having to eat sleep and breathe rugby because he does….it was too much. 

He freaked when I asked him to leave. Told me I don’t appreciate the things he cares about, said I should be thankful he has rugby or else he would be dead. That he has nothing else. I feel horrible.

Hi, I'm 23F and I broke up with my ex boyfriend, who is 28M, because it wasn't working between us anymore and I couldn't see any solutions because it kept happening again and again and after 4 weeks everything was back to normal.
Now he has our son every other weekend. In the beginning he didn't even ask but simply decided that I would bring him our son because he doesn't have a driver's license.
I then told him that it wasn't my responsibility to see how he pickes up our son and brings him home, his mother drove him and that was fine.
He took care of it. Now it's the case that his mother doesn't have time to pick up our son and he can't find a replacement, so I've offered to drive our son to him .
Now he's annoyed because I've offered him this solutin, even though I said before that I wouldn't drive anymore.
Yes, I said I wouldn't drive if he didn't take care of finding a replacement, but since he had really taken care of it, I wanted to accommodate him.
But it looks like he doesn't want me to drive our son to him and apparently prefers to give up his weekend with our son.
So am i the asshole because I told him he had to find a replacement himself, but still offered him a ride in an emergency situation like this?

For the past few food-tech lessons me and my partner had been away (doing other stuff inside of school or just not there those days), today (november 8th) me and my partner had food-tech, we didn’t know we were going to be cooking that period. First off; our teacher got pissed off at us for not being there during some lessons. Whilst beginning to cook I wasn’t able to find a pot, I was stressing out and told our teacher that I couldn’t find one or the other stuff we weren’t able to find. By the time he finally got to helping us, I was even more stressed out because everything was going on at once. I called him bro out of pure habit, as I call everyone bro. He then called me racist? ‘Did you just call me bro? That’s racist’ I immediately apologised before he even called me racist, but he just dismissed my apology. He kept going on about how it was rude (which I understand) but then saying I was being racist? My partner started to get upset and so was I, we ended up walking out of class for the rest of the period. Im so confused with all of this, and let alone he was always passive aggressive towards us. 



edit: I did leave some stuff out, by what I mean by not being there those days I was sick, I couldn’t physically move from how much pain I was in (period cramps specifically), I also had actual school business. I wasn’t able to come to school or come to those lessons (catch-up tests), I never skip class on purpose. Besides that ‘this class isn’t mandatory but still show up’ words from my school. 

We walked out of class because me and my partner both started crying, that’s when our teacher got more pissed off at us. My partner asked if they could go speak to a teacher, I was going to follow along but first I asked our teacher on how what I said was racist, he just completely ignored what I said and didn’t answer me. Several people heard him say ‘that’s racist’. 
I genuinely do not understand on how I was being racist. 

We went and talked to multiple different teachers and got multiple different perspectives, they all said that what I said wasn’t racist and that my teacher was just taking his anger out on me.

20,1gmg4g2,AITA for requesting that my teacher not partner me with my deadbeat father's daughter?,"My father walked out on my mom when she was pregnant with me (16m). They were married for like 5 years at that point but he was cheating a lot. Mom trying to divorce him went through hell because they'd picked up and moved. He never met me. He didn't show up at court for their divorce, or for custody, or for child support. He went to jail three times for failure to pay child support and for trying to avoid child support by quitting his jobs and not declaring his new place of employment. 

I still haven't even met him. But around a year ago he moved back with his family (the affair partner and their kids). He has a daughter 5 months younger than me a son about a year and a half younger and some other kids who are younger again but I don't know their ages. I only know the older two ages because of school and sharing some classes with his daughter.

She has tried to connect with me but I told her I wasn't interested, we're not family, I don't want to know the affair family. Even though she was upset and cried a little in front of me, she didn't give up. And when we returned to our classes in August she was suddenly in four of mine instead of one like last year. So I went to our teacher who assigns a lot of group stuff and asked her to never pair me with her. I explained the reason why and she was surprised but agreed that it would be for the best to avoid hostility during the project and especially if others are working with us.

Twice she has tried to claim me as a partner or make me a part of her group. The first time as her solo partner and the second time in a bigger group. Both times our teacher refused.

This made her realize what I'd done. She told her parents, they went to the principal and demanded a meeting with me and my mom. Mom went but left me out of it and explained why to the principal and told him she didn't think the first time I meet my ""father"" should be when he wants to berate me for not working with his daughter. They tried to say I was bullying their daughter and I should be facing suspension OR be forced to make it up to her through some kind of buddy program. The principal didn't take it seriously. But his daughter and son now stare at me a lot more in school the last couple of weeks, since the meeting, and a couple of her friends said I was such a dick for embarrassing her like that and not getting to know her.

(throwaway account)","So, I (23M) work in a very public-facing job with this guy, let's call him Kyle (25M). We both have, let's say, personas we put on, and I usually keep to myself at work, just sticking to my routine. I know I come off a bit...cold or something, which is fine. I don't really care what people think of me.

Anyway, I see Kyle acting all happy and reliable, but I've noticed he's, like, way too good at pretending he's okay. Always putting on this whole ""I'm-here-for-everyone"" act. He'll help the younger people who look up to him (and they do), but then he'll barely take care of himself. The guy doesn't eat unless someone brings it up, and he has this energy that's way too intense for someone who's supposedly chill when he's all alone. He's also the type to shove his feelings down instead of just...dealing with them? Which sounds hypocritical, but it's worse because he's so fake about it.

So, the other day, we were working late, and I noticed he looked, I don't know, tired or sad? (I'm not good with this stuff.) I asked him if he was alright, which apparently was hilarious to him, because he said something like, ""I'm the one who's supposed to be asking you that."" I snapped and told him that pretending everything's fine all the time isn't sustainable. I might not say much about my own problems, but at least I'm not lying to everyone's face about being okay 24/7.

He got all quiet and looked hurt, then told me that I don't know what it's like to feel responsible for others and that ""some people have to keep it together."" That pissed me off because, yeah, I get that. But it feels fake to me that he can't even let down his guard for, like, a minute.

Now he's been avoiding me, which I guess is fine, but it feels...off? Some of our other coworkers noticed, and one asked if I was being harsh. I'm just annoyed that he acts like I'm the one who ""doesn't get it"" when he's the one lying to himself (and everyone else). AITA?

Edit: To clarify, I'm not mad that he's struggling—I actually get it more than he probably thinks. It's just...annoying to see someone pretend so hard, especially since we're supposed to work together.

Edit 2: We're closer than I made it seem in the post, and I'm sorry for not making that clear. He occasionally tells me how tired he is of being portrayed as the ideal person or ""hero""—the one everyone relies on. He doesn't say it exactly like that since he's a little indirect and prefers to keep his problems to himself. It hurts me to see him like this, especially since we're close friends. He skips meals but constantly reminds everyone else to eat or take care of themselves, but he never does the same for himself. I apologize for the hurtful words I used. Now I know it was wrong to snap at him, especially since it's obvious he's going through a difficult time.

I’ve booked a week off just before the exams to focus purely on studying. Then, knowing how drained and burnt out I’ll be afterward, I’ve booked an extra two days to properly unwind. 

There are a few video games I haven’t touched yet and some books I’ve been meaning to read, so I’d planned a couple of days just chilling in the flat, recharging without any other plans.

When I mentioned my plan to my girlfriend, she pointed out that I was using quite a bit of leave and suggested that I save those two days for us to do something together later. 

I told her I’ll really need those days to switch off and recover and that I've got plenty of leave left over She suggested that if I was going to take them, we could go out for a day or even have a nice meal and drinks together and she could take the time off too.

I told her I’d be up for that another time, but for these days, I genuinely need to just relax—gaming, reading, and not leaving the flat. I explained that I don’t want to plan anything else because I’ll need the downtime to recharge.

She said I should be willing to compromise and make a few plans with her, but I just repeated that I’ll need this time alone to decompress after the exams.

23,1gmd3oe,AITA for refusing to pay for renovations that my parents want because i live at home with them but don't pay rent?,"For some backstory, I used to work in a different line of work and was living by myself in another city until 2020 when I moved back in with my parents due to my dad going through some medical issues and my mom having to become a caregiver for him for a period of time. I had just switched jobs during covid and now work 2 fully remote jobs from home with extremely flexible working hours which has allowed me to essentially become a pseudo parent for my younger brother who is 12 years my junior.

I (29m) currently live with my parents (late 50s) and my younger brother (17m). I do not pay rent; however, I take care of 100% of the monthly bills/groceries for the house (owned by parents) after moving back in and have been paying for any maintenance costs for anything that has broken down in the last 7 years. I have also paid for new appliances to replace broken ones that include a new refrigerator, a new washing machine and 3 new A/C units.  
  
I am also currently taking care of 100% of my brother's college tuition and will be for the next 2 years, paid for his driving lessons, paid for an old car for him, paying for his rent and food (college is in a different part of the country), and paying for his air tickets to come back and visit once every 3 months. (at request of parents)

I paid for my own way through college as my parents did not support my choice of studies, including working myself to death to pay for food and lodging during that. I have basically been supporting myself since I was 16. I basically had no social life during that because I had to work 3 different jobs to make ends meet.

My parents want to do a major remodel to the house that will cost a not insignificant amount of money. Yes, I am making enough money to pay for all this, but this is where I am putting my foot down and I refused. My parents insisted that since I am living at home and have not paid a single cent of rent for the last 4 years that this is a very reasonable request.

The drama has now spread to my extended family and my aunts and uncles are now texting me and saying that I am an ungrateful child since I am refusing this and are trying to pressure me into paying for the renos. 

I think that I have paid for more than enough in the last 10 years considering all the financial responsibilities that I have taken on.

Without revealing where we live, she's been unemployed for nearly two years and has been on social services payments this whole time. I've been (and still am) working full time. She has a fair chunk of savings from when she did work and we currently live with my parents, so there aren't many household expenses at the moment though obviously she doesn't get much income. Recently, we went on a long vacation, and before doing so I told her that she should notify social services that she would be leaving the country, as they would have to pause her payments until she returns. 

Four weeks into vacation she gets an international call from them which she missed, and a notification that she now owes them money. So obviously she didn't do that. I kept my mouth shut since scolding her wouldn't really do anything; just to get it sorted out when we returned. 

Now, two weeks after we're back, she comes in whole I'm working from home, saying she's too anxious to call them and get it sorted out. I offer to be there on hold with her, since I still need to work. She says I could call them on my behalf when I'm on lunch break.

Additional context: I'm currently in therapy for various things. She's on the spectrum and hasn't been to therapy in years, despite me telling her to start again. She cites the cost (which is admittedly pretty expensive). I also have to pay for our couples therapy when we do that.

I wish I could give those little award thingies to everyone responding because WOW 🙂

Please ignore the ""auto reddit name"", definitely not smart, definitely not a cardiologist.

Thank you in advance for your judgement.  Long story short:

At the behest of my wife, I bought my stepson a 2004 Yamaha Warrior 350cc for his 14th birthday for $1600.  It's been a great little ATV.  He and his friends rode it, and have ridden it, very hard for 4 years, frequently ""breaking it"".

Due to this, I have completely rebuilt it from the ground up:  new springs, struts, a-arms, new swing arm, new plastics, new graphics, new lights, new brakes, new wheels, new tires, spent $2100 on rebuilding the engine, and countless $$$, hours, and nightmares troubleshooting it.  I have literally been in the garage overnight working on it.  Only think not new is the frame, the seat, and the electrical.

Every time something wrong happens, I ask what exactly happened and get the same answers:  ""i-own-know?"".  I never get *any* help, curiosity, or participation regarding the failure, the troubleshooting, or the work and sometimes clever tricks required to get it going again.  It's been a labor of love, but only for me, unfortunately.

Now, after the latest failure (electrical, I'm still troubleshooting) his mother is pressuring me to sell it and give him the money.  My argument is ""it stays here for him and his friends to enjoy"".

We have 3 ATVs and land that they can romp around on, which is loads of fun.  He's 18, barely works (maybe 20 hours a week?), does the absolute minimum of online school to graduate this year, and frankly, I feel taken advantage of, and do not think it's right to reward him for all my hard work for which I've received zero appreciation -- no thanks and absolutely no love, nothing from the wife (seriously , she never touches me).  My wife says I'm being ""an Indian giver"" by not wanting to sell it and give him the money.


I agree there are several underlying issues going on adding to my overall sentiment.  However, regarding the ATV,  Am I the asshole?  I understand it was a gift, but something doesn't feel right.

My Mom currently lives with my grandmother but needs to be relocated to a retirement home for a higher level of care. I have been researching/visiting several homes.

Last month, my aunt visited me and told me that she and another aunt had also been researching/visiting retirement homes. I was a little taken aback because they knew I had been doing research and never talked to me about it. But then I thought they were just trying to be helpful - I’m seven months pregnant, work full-time, and am in the middle of home renovations. I asked if they could include me in future planning and they agreed. 

My aunts think my Mom just needs assisted living but I disagree and think she needs memory care - she gets lost in my grandmother’s home, wandered once, and struggles to communicate her needs. She needs assistance with most daily living activities (dressing, bathing,diaper changes). I wasn’t going to push the issue because when we tour homes with my mother, she will be assessed and a nurse will determine whether she needs assisted living or memory care. 

My mother lives across the province so my aunt planned a trip so we could tour several nearby homes with her. But then they told me they only want to visit one home. It’s a very nice place and but I’m concerned because the memory care floor would be out of budget by $1000/month. I asked if they would consider visiting at least one other home while she’s in the area (it’s not as nice but it’s memory care floor is within budget) and they refused. 

We also initially discussed moving her in the winter but now they want to move her at the beginning of December. I’m not opposed to it but got upset because I wasn’t consulted. It would be me and my husband moving her (which would also require time off work). 

This all has blown up and become a big issue. I know they mean well and want the best for my Mom but I blew up on them because I’m being cut out of the planning.

30,1gm8wni,AITA Wife doesn't want me to take a trip with son(5),"I like to take my son on overnight trips to our family cabin. It's 2 hours away. I did it a few times when he was 3 and 4 years old. I like the time with just the two of us. We drink cocoa, walk in the woods, play video games and he sleeps with me at night. It's nice.

I want to do another trip with him but my wife is saying no to two of the options I offered.

**Option 1)** I take him during the work week. He's in Kindergarten and I know he won't miss much for those 2 days. Plus our cabin will be available during the week (it's rented most weekends, so if I take a weekend, it's a $ loss). She's a teacher is strongly against taking a kid out of school for non emergencies. I know what he does in Kindergarten, he can already read and write, he's not missing anything.

The other downside here is that she will have to take our daughter to daycare, which means she has to leave the house at 6:15am instead of 6:40am. So she'll have to get up earlier in order to get her to daycare and then to work on-time. She does not want to do this.

**Option 2)** I take him on the weekend. She says that she gets so little time with him as it is, she doesn't see him in the morning since I get the kids to school, and after work everyone is tired from school/work and she only seems him for dinner and then bed time. The weekend is when she would see him (and the daughter).

She's also a bit nervous about being sole provider for the baby (16 months) for the weekend since I'm always there to help.

TLDR;, I can't have my trip with my son. The weekday means she has to wake up early and he misses school. The weekend means she has to be a single parent and doesn't get to see her son.

  
Edit: We go to the cabin together as a family all the time. Every other month, and more in the summer. So this isn't about excluding them. It's that I want some solo time away with my son.

The other downside here is that she will have to take our daughter to daycare, which means she has to leave the house at 6:15am instead of 6:40am. So she'll have to get up earlier in order to get her to daycare and then to work on-time. She does not want to do this.

**Option 2)** I take him on the weekend. She says that she gets so little time with him as it is, she doesn't see him in the morning since I get the kids to school, and after work everyone is tired from school/work and she only seems him for dinner and then bed time. The weekend is when she would see him (and the daughter).

She's also a bit nervous about being sole provider for the baby (16 months) for the weekend since I'm always there to help.

TLDR;, I can't have my trip with my son. The weekday means she has to wake up early and he misses school. The weekend means she has to be a single parent and doesn't get to see her son.

  
Edit: We go to the cabin together as a family all the time. Every other month, and more in the summer. So this isn't about excluding them. It's that I want some solo time away with my son.

31,1gm6vh4,AITA for telling my sister that I can't go to her wedding without my son?,"I (24, f) have a five-year-old son named Sam. I had my son at a very young age, as did his father, John, with whom I have a healthy relationship to this day. John is American, I am not, so we got married when I got pregnant so we could all live here in the US.

My family was not happy with my pregnancy and pretty much shut me out of their lives. John's parents very happily accepted me, but they are very old, and all the responsibility of caring for Sam falls on us, which means no nights off, no frequent dates, and nothing that generally can't involve Sam. The responsibility falls especially on me since I take care of the household while John works long shifts.

Six months ago, my mother called me to tell me that my sister was getting married. During a video call, my sister asked me to be her maid of honor, which I excitedly accepted. However, when I received the invitation, problems arose.

The wedding was to be in my country, and each guest was required to cover their own travel, lodging, and clothing expenses. John offered to work overtime so that Sam and I could go, and after months of extra work, I managed to buy a nice dress and book a simple hotel room.

A month before the wedding, I called my sister to confirm our attendance, and that's when she informed me that children were not allowed at the ceremony. I told her that wasn't specified on the invitation (it literally wasn't written anywhere on the invitation) and she said she hoped everyone would just take that for granted. I explained that I didn't have anyone to leave Sam with, and reminded her of our financial situation, and she suggested leaving him with John or hire a nanny.

John works long shifts, and we don't have the budget for a nanny for so many days just for a wedding.

She compared the situation to when I hired a nanny during my father's hospitalization, which seemed pretty stupid to me since it was a medical emergency and not a social event. After an argument, I told her that I would have to decline my role as bridesmaid since I couldn't leave my son. I want to clarify that I never asked her to make an exception for Sam (because I understand that weddings are not places for children, lol, I'm not an idiot just a person who doesn't take things for granted), I just wanted her to understand my situation AFTER I told her I couldn't go.

She called me selfish and mentioned that she had already paid for my place in the wedding. I offered to reimburse her with the money for the dress, but she just hung up. Now there are two weeks left until the wedding but I keep getting messages from her, calls to insult me ​​and emails arguing that since I live in the US I should have enough money for a babysitter, wich at least in my opinion is totally ridiculous.

32,1gm6soi,AITA For not attending my friends wedding,"I (27F) have been best friends with D (33F) for 12 years. We’ve been through everything together—relationships, family trips, and all the ups and downs.

To give some background, D’s relationship with her fiancé started on a shaky note. He kissed her while she was still in a long-term relationship.

Before her fiancé, D was monogamous, but her fiancé pressured her into an open relationship. She initially said no, but after two years, she caved and agreed. This decision came after a major betrayal—her fiancé hooked up with her male best friend at a club before they were technically in an open relationship. Understandably, D was devastated, and the betrayal tested their relationship. Despite everything, she forgave them both.

One night, D called me completely broken. She couldn’t explain what was wrong, but after some prodding, she revealed that during the first two years of their monogamous relationship, her fiancé had cheated on her with at least 15 different men. That was a dealbreaker for me. I felt like after the first betrayal, there was no reason for her to forgive him again. His excuse for the cheating was that he had “inner trauma” from not being able to express his sexuality in college, which led him to cheat. While I can understand the complexity of his emotions, I just couldn’t accept that he chose to stay in a relationship and continue hurting D instead of breaking up with her and exploring his sexuality in a healthier way.

But D forgave him again. Over time, she stopped sharing details about their relationship, and I decided to try and accept him—though I could never fully forgive him. We went out with my parents to dinner, and her fiancé showed up late. When they paid the bill, he didn’t even thank them. Then, when we visited their new house, he walked out saying he had plans. D apologized for him profusely, as if it was her fault. I was beyond frustrated with him, and my feelings of resentment only grew.

Later, D moved away for a job, and they decided to keep their relationship open while he finished school, and she pursued her career. But I felt like D was the only one who wasn’t exploring the open relationship. Her fiancé was clearly dating other people, while D stayed monogamous.

Out of nowhere, her fiancé proposed to her just before she moved for her new job. He chose to do it during her little brother's graduation week, which took attention away from her brothers' moment. To make matters worse, he told everyone about the proposal—except me. He even told the guy he cheated with. D said yes, and while I congratulated her, I couldn’t share in her happiness.

Now, with their wedding approaching, I just can’t find it in me to like him. I’ve tried, but every time I try to tolerate him, he does something rude or inconsiderate.

I want to be there for her, but I’m struggling with whether I can truly support this relationship.

33,1gm66qv,AITA for not doing a good enough job checking in on my friend,"My (22F) friend (22F) had a series of consistent sicknesses and injuries for over a year.  First she had a foot injury,  then covid, then during the summer she got another injury, in between I think there were some other issues too. I am not the type of person to coddle people and nor were any of these issues serious to warrant coddling, but I am the type of person to physically be there when I'm needed and to check in. Which she would know since we've been friends for like 8 years. 

Going forward to October, her birthday is early in the month and mine is later. For her birthday I asked her when she was free,  picked her up,  paid for both her dinner and an activity that we did. For my birthday I suggested a date and place for dinner ahead of time not giving anyone the chance to ask. We also planned another brunch for end of October.

She got into a car accident mid-October and had to reschedule my celebration,  which i said was fine and she should prioritize healing. I offered to come over to her house, chill and order food to which she said she didn't want to.  Later for the end of October brunch she claimed she got food poisoning. I felt a bit bothered by the rebuffs, not because she wasn't feeling well but because they were cancelations without any offering to reschedule for when she's better, so I stopped trying and neither of us messaged back.

A year later I hung out with a mutual friend (they also no longer speak) and the topic gets brought up. Apparently both of them went out to eat during early November (keep in mind basically a week after I was canceled on due to apparent food poisoning). She brought up to our mutual friend that she felt bothered that I didn't check in on her about her accident and was too focused on my birthday.

Hearing this bothered me because firstly i looked through the messages and I did say that I hope she feels better. I was also trying to schedule hangouts because I wanted to hang out with her and wanted to ask her about how she was doing in detail in person. I also know she didn't have severe injuries because late October she canceled because of food poisoning then was able to hang out with mutual friend about a week later (who note: at one point she told me to stop being friends with).

I also think that we have been friends long enough that she should have confronted me about how she was feeling so I could have told her that I didn't care about my birthday, I was trying to hang out with her and wanted to ask her about how she's doing in person. I just thought she didn't want to hang out with me, I didn't know why, in the month of October I got rebuffs from like 4 people, so I was like whatever if someone doesn't want to hang out then I won't try.

34,1gm5o9p,AITA For adopting my neighbors dog,"My next door neighbor used to own this dog that they constantly allowed to run free during the day while they were at work even though we live in a city. The neighbors are generally bad neighbors they constantly block my drive way and just rude people. Recently the dog went missing, they even came out on me accusing me of stealing the dog. I was very much offended. I had no clue where the dog disappeared too. I do know the dog was always friendly with my kids and family. 

It had been run over once before and had a permanently damaged leg but was still sweet. Well flash forward about 2 weeks and we find the dog in an animal shelter. Apparently a road crew found the dog on the street we live on and called animal control because they thought it was a stray. No collar tags or chip obviously even though collar and tags are required in our city.

We decided to ask some questions. The dog had been in hold waiting to be claimed and had just been released for adoption because no one had claimed him. We went ahead and adopted him making him legally ours, partly because we like the dog and felt we would be better owners. Partly because we are petty and wanted to get under their skin.

It worked. They are infuriated accusing us of stealing the dog worse than before we learned the dog was in the shelter. We refused to give the dog back. They called the cops. We were able to prove they abandoned the dog and we legally adopted the dog at the shelter. Then they started backpedaling to avoid fines saying they could be mistaken but at the end of the day it’s only made their behavior worse. Honestly to be expected but I know as long as their behavior is worse it’s because I’m rent free in their heads. What I want to know is AITA for adopting the dog?

Edit: To clarify we didn’t just go down to the animal shelter looking to adopt. We came across the dog online through social media. This seemed to be a curiosity of some readers.
