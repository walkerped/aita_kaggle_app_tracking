0,1gm7rd8,AITA for changing my name despite my dad not wanting me to?,"Ok, so, I’m not gonna work too hard on this post but I just need to get it out somewhere.

I am a teenager. I used to have a very pretty name. It was based on my great grandmothers name. For the sake of anonymity I will say it was Jasmine.

During middle school I did a lot of self exploration and I’ve found that my gender isn’t exactly linear. I am unable to put it into simple words on a Reddit post at the moment but in short it’s kind of ineffable. For a while I went by Daniel (not really but again, anonymity) when I found myself in a more masculine aligned state. Now I go by a unisex name. I’ll use Alex. I didn’t really bring up Dan much to my dad but he used to get very upset when my friends called me it and would demand I change it. He used to say it was “too masculine” or “disrespectful” to my mother (who doesn’t care and is/was very accepting) and my great grandmother (dead) 

Obviously this made me feel terrible about many things. 

When I moved onto Alex he was more accepting because it wasn’t as much of a “boy name” (imo names don’t have gender. They’re words. We respond to them. That’s it.) and he even calls me by it. So he’s trying. Keep that in mind. However, every so often he’ll say things like “Every night I pray to god you’ll give up on this ‘Alex’ thing and go back to Jasmine”. He’s not even religious. 

That’s basically the whole thing, but I’ll say this: my name is an intrinsic part of my identity and my gender as a trans person. Him rejecting it and telling me he wishes I’ll go back to the feminine name that I feel deeply uncomfortable with and like the real me is hiding or being pushed down when it’s used feels like he’s rejecting my identity as a trans person. As me. Like he wants me to be someone im not. It eats me alive constantly. 

His reasoning for being upset is that he feels like my name is a part of our bond as father and child. He feels like it’s something we share. He gave it to me, so it’s a little bit his.

I feel like it’s mine. He also said that he should be allowed to express how he feels to me because all feelings are valid. I always feel so deeply and incredibly hurt and rejected when he expresses how he feels and I think it should be your job as a parent to be supportive of your child’s emotional needs. On the other hand I think expressing how you feel, even if it’s a bit taboo should be something everyone should be able to do. I just don’t think it should me he comes to.

Ps. If you’re going to make a comment please don’t make it about my gender being complicated. Please don’t comment on my identity in a negative way. Please don’t say anything about how young I am. I know. I know. Stay on the topic of the subreddit. Any transphobia will be thoroughly ignored by me and if I remember the rules correctly, likely deleted.

So, AITA for changing my name and not liking how he handled the situation? (& telling him that)
