0,1gnkl46,AITA for abandoning my mother in a foreign country?,"I (28 NB) have a complicated relationship with my mother. At 19 I moved to the US for college but moved back home after graduation as I was starting to experience the first difficult symptoms of my mental illness.



While I was staying at home, my mom would give me the silent treatment, especially after my savings ran out. She refused to get me psychiatric help and when I finally managed to find a psychiatrist (it's really hard to get one in my country), she would insult me about having to get help. She never even spoke to me when she came home. She only approached me when she wanted money or to vent about something. My extended family members who would ocassionally call me when I was in the US to ask for money now no longer called or cared. I even asked an aunt if I could live with her for a while because things were hard at home and she said no, I should work it out with mom. This was the same aunt who walked me into a phone shop, chose a phone and then told me to pay without prior discussion. Basically cornered and ambushed me to buy her a phone I hadn't even agreed to but that's a story for another day.



In December, while I was still hospitalised, she called me and told me she has decided to move to the US now that it's clear that I'm not going to be financially helping her. She had accrued a lot of debt over the years to attend and host over the top events in hopes that once I graduate, I'll be sending her money monthly. She had grown to resent me now that I didn't get a job in the US after graduation (because I could barely function as a human) and had then moved to Europe for grad school. She was extremely unsupportive during my grad school applications and I heard the worst insults any child would ever hear from their mother. She gave me a whole speech about how ungrateful I had become as a child, that I showed no appreciation for her and that I drove her to now seek a job in the US because she now has to pay her own debts. After all the insults, she wanted me to fill in her visa paperwork. She would bombard me with calls while I was in hospital in between therapy sessions to ask if I submitted her paperwork.



After doing her visa work, I went no contact. There was a cousin from my dad's side who was helping her get a job in the US, illegally I might add. She got her visa but I didn't help with questions about where she was going, what flights to book, what to expect etc. I just went no contact and left her to deal with her own things because I was mentally exhausted and couldn't take it anymore. She moved to the US and I have never called to ask where she lives, or what she does. She finally started telling family members that we don't talk and now they're calling and texting me telling me I'm cold, unforgiving and an asshole for letting my mother go to a new country alone and unsupported. Some cousins have also asked if I can help them move to the US but they're mostly just calling me to insult me for abandoning my mother.

1,1gnkj0q,AITA for telling someone to shut up and mind their own business?,"My girlfriend (20f) and I (20m) were at a party at her brother's (27m) house. Her brother's new girlfriend (25f) was also there and she was really interested in talking to me. My girlfriend and I were confused by it but I was friendly until she got super pushy and wouldn't back off.

I'm adopted. She's adopted. She wanted to talk to a fellow adoptee and asked my story. Once she heard it she got really weird with me. She asked me if I had found my parents yet and I told her I didn't need to find them, I knew my parents. They raised me. She rolled her eyes and told me those were my buyers, not my parents.

For context. I had the ""worst adoption"" one where I was adopted at birth and my parents ""bought"" me. Not quite what happened. I explained when she questioned stuff. But she ignored me. I was adopted privately. My birth people knew my parents and approached them about taking me since they didn't want to be parents. My parents did pay for my birth mother's expenses and gave them some money during the rest of the pregnancy but I don't feel bought, personally. And I don't feel like my parents are monsters or some evil baby buying people.

My girlfriend told her she was being weird and it wasn't a great way to meet us. She said the minute she found out I was adopted she knew we needed to meet and talk. My girlfriend tried to get her brother to intervene when his girlfriend wouldn't leave it but he was drunk and not fit to do anything. I tried walking away but she followed us around.

She tried to spew all this anti-adoption stuff and she insulted my parents. I told her I was happy I was adopted. Didn't want to hear shit about my parent. She wanted me to open my eyes and told me I'd regret not finding my real family. I told her to shut up, she doesn't know me, she doesn't know my family, and she has no right to pester me about her opinion. I told her to mind her own business in future because nobody should be told how they feel. 

She made a scene and we left. My girlfriends brother called a couple of days later and he said I really pissed off his girlfriend and why did I have to be so rude to her. She was just trying to engage adoptee to adoptee. My girlfriend told him she did a terrible job. Then his girlfriend started texting my girlfriend to tell me I was rude without a good reason.

2,1gnjy48,AITA for telling my depressed BF he wants to be miserable?,"My bf (59M) and I (40F) have been together for >10 years. When we met, we were both unemployed and struggling a bit, living in a big expensive City. I quickly got sorted out and then supported him financially for many years until he also got steady work.

He's always struggled with depression. Before we met, he had had courses of CBT and done a meditation course that he said helped. Since we've been together, he's been up and down. He's had antidepressants for up to 6 months at a time but they didn't help.

A number of years ago, I decided to change industry. I went through years of planning and training. He supported me through doing the shopping and cooking (I was still the main breadwinner). I regularly spoke to him throughout about the fact that I may have to move away.

18 months ago I got a job in Small Town, leaving him behind in City. There was some choice but it wasn't completely in my control. When I first moved, he had a big breakdown. I had constant calls and texts, and long messages on my answerphone while I was at work about how he couldn't live without me and he was going to end it all. He wouldn't speak to anyone else. After about 3 weeks I snapped and told him I couldn't listen any more. He stepped down the intensity, but we still spoke every day.

I lived in work accommodation and we've met up about every 6 weeks. I organise the meet ups, he goes along with whatever I suggest. When we part, he always spends a couple of days crying and telling me he doesn't want to live. I'm now in the process of buying a house in Small Town.

When we are together, I feel our relationship now is better than it was before we left. We actually have sex more often and have more fun. I'm much happier living in Small Town than I was in City.

Today I left after spending a week with him in City. He called me at 5pm saying he was going to sleep as there is nothing for him to stay awake for. I encouraged him to find something to do for the evening, he said it was pointless. I said well it's your choice to be miserable, he was very upset by this.

3,1gnjx2z,WIBTA for telling my friend not to marry his girlfriend and to break up with her?,"I (24M) have a friend (24M), who we'll call Jay. Jay is an American citizen but moved here was he was around 12 from a different country. His girlfriend (23F), let's call her Sara, is also from this same country, but is not a citizen. They met in college about 2 years ago. 

Yesterday, Jay told me that Sara told him that they have to get married now. Otherwise, she will break up with him. She is currently in graduate school (the relationship is long distance currently) and will have to either find a job, get married, or go back to her home country after her degree is done next year. According to Jay, she says that the type of job she wants (finance), is not easily available to someone who isn't a US Citizen or Green Card holder.

I think it's relevant to say here that Sara's family are extremely wealthy. When Sara was in college, she bought herself a new Mercedes, for example. Jay is not ultra-wealthy like this, but has a high paying job.  

Jay and Sara have, in my opinion, a tenuous relationship. She has ""broken up"" with him many times over the past 2 years, always over small arguments, at least according to Jay. He then asks to get back together a week or so later. She also doesn't allow him to go anywhere outside of work if there are other women present. I'm paraphrasing here, but Jay said that ""when Sara wants something, she gets it, or there will be problems."" Jay also mentioned that he thinks Sara's father might be pressuring her to get married. 

According to Jay, Sara says that she would do this for him, and so he should do it for her. If he doesn't do it, then he doesn't love her, and they should break up.  
  
Jay told me that he doesn't want to break up with her, so he might go along and do this. I asked him if he loved her, and her didn't really give me a straight answer. I asked him if he had any other friends to talk to about this, and he said he would only talk about this with me and a single mutual friend of ours.

7,1gniq93,AITA for reporting my dorm mate for making noise at 4am? ,"I 15F go to a boarding school in Connecticut, it is not a typical boarding school (it’s for autistic kids) and therefore the kids can be quite weird, stupid, anti social and just general out of the ordinary. I am not being unkind when I say that but it’s just the facts. Because of this our rules are very different than a traditional boarding school, we have simple rules like always propping our doors when we have a friend in our room (everyone has their own room) and turning in tech at 10pm. However, we do get to keep our phones at all times. Anyways, the issue occurred on Tuesday morning at around 4:30 in the morning. My room is at the end of a hallway in between the door to a stairwell and the single bathroom. We have two single bathrooms with showers as well as a shared bathroom with stalls of toilets and showers. So it was 4:30 in the morning and all of a sudden I am woken up by Taylor swift music playing quite loudly, for context A. I am not a light sleeper, it’s pretty hard to wake me as I have grown up with two younger brothers and slept through babies crying as a kid. So the music was loud to the point where it obviously woke me. B. I’m a huge Taylor swift fan so it was not that it was Taylor music playing that bothered me, sometimes I will fall asleep to Taylor music (subtly in the background) but it made me very quickly know who was doing this. 
So after about 5/10 minutes of this music I roll out of bed and go knock on the bathroom door, as I approach I realize she is also blow drying her hair which isn’t as obvious with the music covering it up. I ask her to please turn off the music or use earphones as we are trying to sleep, I obviously don’t mind that she’s awake, but we aren’t supposed to leave our rooms before 7 or 7:30. As I say this I hear a voice coming from the common room agreeing with me that they are trying to read. 
So she shouts back fine and lowers the volume a tad. I am exhausted obviously so I crawl back to my bed and collapse hoping to fall back asleep. But now that the music is (slightly) lower the blow dryer is extremely obvious. I try to ignore it for longer this time hoping she would finish soon but after 15 ish minutes I get out my phone. This is where I might be the AH. We have an “emergency” phone number called the “bat phone” that we are supposed to message or call if we need any “urgent help” through the night. This phone is used for medical emergencies but from what I remembered in that moment I thought if by that this was an appropriate use of the phone number. Knowing what time it was and the extent of the situation I decide to send one simple text. I will inset a screenshot below but I basically said “Hi, I woke up to the sound of someone playing music quite loudly in the bathroom, I asked them to turn it off and they did but they are still blow drying their hair which is also quite loud” I turn off my phone and try to sleep not expecting a response but five minutes later I get a text asking who it is, I tell them and they say they will handle. No one did in the moment and about half an hour later the blow drying and music stopped. I never fully fell asleep again and ended up missing my first class that morning. Later that day we have our floor meeting. After announcements “jane” raises her hand and announces that it was her that was making the noise but that who ever texted bat phone did not need to do that and could have just knocked on the door or texted her (I did) and that “whoever” (me) did it should not have bothered the person on bat phone. That is basically it and nothing else has come up and I generally do not like this person (hate) and she is very annoying so I don’t care if she’s mad. I do wonder if there was a better way to handle it. So AITA? 


More context about “jane”: 



This specific person is a very big fan of Taylor swift but I personally find this person (let’s call her jane) to be EXTREMELY annoying. (Ex. I had to explain what sports divisions in college were to her) she claims herself to be the biggest Taylor swift fan on campus which is very obviously not true (my best friend and I) she has only been a fan for about 6 months and recently went to the eras tour with front row floor tickets that she was given by a friend. Now on the daily she consistently reminds us of that by saying things like “omg I was there when she wore the new reputation outfit” whenever a song would play. She likes to figure out really weird ways to connect herself to what we are saying, I was speaking with a visiting college representative and she asked what I want to major in and what career I was hoping for, and what my parents careers were (my mom is a psychologist) etc… Jane makes a point to chime in and say “oh my moms friend is a psychologist too” like ok thanks that’s irrelevant. She consistently says “real!” and “same!” And try’s to insert herself where she is not welcome. I am aware of the fact that she supposedly has a very very low IQ. When I first arrived she immediately declared us best friends due to my love of Taylor swift. She was just A lot at once and it felt really weird so I basically just ignored her after a certain point. Basically within 48 hours of my arrival she was already talking about the two of us going to the eras tour together and staying in a hotel room. I was very uncomfortable. I later expressed my concerns to my now best friend Molly who told me the real reason why she wasn’t friends with jane and basically helped shed light on why she didn’t like jane and how she generally acted. It started to add up and make sense in relation to the actions of Jane’s I had already witnessed. I originally did find it quite weird that Molly and Jane being the two “swifties” on campus were not friends but this made it make sense. So yeah that’s basically it. 

I will try and think of a better example of why jane is stupid. 

Also she calls everybody “pooks” and “pookie” which I find weird but okay. 

",TL;DR,2024-11-09,"AITA for reporting my dorm mate for making noise at 4am?  I 15F go to a boarding school in Connecticut, it is not a typical boarding school (it’s for autistic kids) and therefore the kids can be quite weird, stupid, anti social and just general out of the ordinary. I am not being unkind when I say that but it’s just the facts. Because of this our rules are very different than a traditional boarding school, we have simple rules like always propping our doors when we have a friend in our room (everyone has their own room) and turning in tech at 10pm. However, we do get to keep our phones at all times. Anyways, the issue occurred on Tuesday morning at around 4:30 in the morning. My room is at the end of a hallway in between the door to a stairwell and the single bathroom. We have two single bathrooms with showers as well as a shared bathroom with stalls of toilets and showers. So it was 4:30 in the morning and all of a sudden I am woken up by Taylor swift music playing quite loudly, for context A. I am not a light sleeper, it’s pretty hard to wake me as I have grown up with two younger brothers and slept through babies crying as a kid. So the music was loud to the point where it obviously woke me. B. I’m a huge Taylor swift fan so it was not that it was Taylor music playing that bothered me, sometimes I will fall asleep to Taylor music (subtly in the background) but it made me very quickly know who was doing this. 
So after about 5/10 minutes of this music I roll out of bed and go knock on the bathroom door, as I approach I realize she is also blow drying her hair which isn’t as obvious with the music covering it up. I ask her to please turn off the music or use earphones as we are trying to sleep, I obviously don’t mind that she’s awake, but we aren’t supposed to leave our rooms before 7 or 7:30. As I say this I hear a voice coming from the common room agreeing with me that they are trying to read. 
So she shouts back fine and lowers the volume a tad. I am exhausted obviously so I crawl back to my bed and collapse hoping to fall back asleep. But now that the music is (slightly) lower the blow dryer is extremely obvious. I try to ignore it for longer this time hoping she would finish soon but after 15 ish minutes I get out my phone. This is where I might be the AH. We have an “emergency” phone number called the “bat phone” that we are supposed to message or call if we need any “urgent help” through the night. This phone is used for medical emergencies but from what I remembered in that moment I thought if by that this was an appropriate use of the phone number. Knowing what time it was and the extent of the situation I decide to send one simple text. I will inset a screenshot below but I basically said “Hi, I woke up to the sound of someone playing music quite loudly in the bathroom, I asked them to turn it off and they did but they are still blow drying their hair which is also quite loud” I turn off my phone and try to sleep not expecting a response but five minutes later I get a text asking who it is, I tell them and they say they will handle. No one did in the moment and about half an hour later the blow drying and music stopped. I never fully fell asleep again and ended up missing my first class that morning. Later that day we have our floor meeting. After announcements “jane” raises her hand and announces that it was her that was making the noise but that who ever texted bat phone did not need to do that and could have just knocked on the door or texted her (I did) and that “whoever” (me) did it should not have bothered the person on bat phone. That is basically it and nothing else has come up and I generally do not like this person (hate) and she is very annoying so I don’t care if she’s mad. I do wonder if there was a better way to handle it. So AITA? 


More context about “jane”: 



This specific person is a very big fan of Taylor swift but I personally find this person (let’s call her jane) to be EXTREMELY annoying. (Ex. I had to explain what sports divisions in college were to her) she claims herself to be the biggest Taylor swift fan on campus which is very obviously not true (my best friend and I) she has only been a fan for about 6 months and recently went to the eras tour with front row floor tickets that she was given by a friend. Now on the daily she consistently reminds us of that by saying things like “omg I was there when she wore the new reputation outfit” whenever a song would play.

So two of my roommates started smoking a few weeks ago, and while they’ve been considerate of the rest of us by smoking outside, I’m concerned about our lease.

I’m anxious about that because out property manager lives nearby and could happen to see them at any time even if they’re not intentionally doing a drive by.

Me (f) and my bf (both late 20s) live in a house with several apartments. We have a group chat to communicate in case of emergencies or urgent house stuff, but I don’t really know any of them. So today, one of our neighbours posted on this chat saying her and her bfs (both mid 30s I guess) fridge had broken and if anyone of us had some spare space in our freezers to store their frozen goods until they get a new fridge.

We hadn’t lived in the building for long and I wanted to prove myself as a good neighbour, so I offered that we could keep some of their things in our freezer - thinking we’re talking frozen peas, French fries, maybe some meats. When she showed up at my doorstep, they handed me a couple of frozen foods and a large plastic container. I wanted to be polite and we were making some small talk when she casually mentioned that the container held *her placenta* that they were going to bury at some point but haven’t gotten around to do it in the five years since their child was born.

I was completely gobsmacked. It’s not that I’m in any way appalled or disgusted by human, especially female body functions and I support women handling their pregnancy, childbirth and placenta however they see fit, but standing in my doorway holding the placenta of a woman I barely even know just felt weirdly intimate and strange. I was also taken aback by how nonchalantly she just handed me her organ in a Tupperware container without even discussing it first. 

So I told her that I would be happy to store all their food items for them until they get a new fridge, but that I was highly umcomfortable with keeping her placenta, that she would have to make other arrangements and handed her the container. She didn’t take it well and argued that there’s no difference to the frozen foods, that the placenta was safely wrapped, that it shouldn’t bother me and that I should hold up to my promise and be a good neighbour like I offered because they’re relying on me. While all of this is kind of true, I still didn’t feel comfortable storing her placenta next to my food or in my possession at all for that matter. She took all of the frozen foods out of my hands and stormed off, loudly complaining that I was shaming a mom for a perfectly normal and healthy body function, that I’m a bigot, shitty neighbour and basically person for not helping them out in time of need.

When I told my boyfriend he was on my side, but some of my friends think I should have just sucked it up, that the placenta wouldn’t have even touched my food, that I’m being weird about it for no reason and that I’m robbing parents of their chance to perform a meaningful ritual.

0,1gn7mqk,AITA for blowing up on my husband after our son came out as trans to him?,"
I'm using a throwaway because my husband has reddit.

Some backstory: I(39F) and my husband(43M) have been married for 17 years now and we've never had an argument this big. Our son (19M) has recently come out to me, as I work in a pediatric hospital with kids apart of the lgbtqia+ community. 

So, after my son came out to me with his new name(let's call him ethan), I asked if he had spoke to his father about it since he has an older mindset and isn't quite up to date with the new terms and labels. After ethan said no, I told him we could go out for a family dinner with us, his father and his sister(14F) to tell them about it. He agreed to this so I set up a date for the dinner.
On the day of the dinner, I had picked one of the fancy restaurants in the town and sat down with everyone.

Here is a rough transcript of what happened. E- ethan, M- me, A- andrew(my husband), G- Georgia(my daughter)

M-"" Listen everyone, I've decided to take us all out this evening for a special reason. Tonight is quite nerve racking for some people but with the right support, I believe we can help them.""

A-"" Don't tell me I've forgotten our anniversary.""

M-""No baby, it's something different. Would you care to take over, ethan?""

Andrew looked around confused until my son started talking.

E-""I just want to say thay I haven't been feeling comfortable in my own body recently. What I've done is some research on different sexual orientations and I figured out in trans. I no longer would like to go by *deadname*, and prefer that name ethan.""

G-"" Wow. Okay. Is there any chance you could explain things further? What made you think this?""

E-"" Just I dont really feel like my true self in certain items of clothing like dresses, skirts, skinny jeans, and that sort of thing. I've found out the term for what I'm feeling is dysphoria.""

A-"" Listen, *deadname*, I dont know what kind of  person put a spell on you but you're not ethan. you're *deadname* and always will be *deadname*. I can't believe this.""

After this interaction, my husband got up to leave but I dragged him back down into his seat and tried to explain things more clearly for him.

After he still wansnt getting what any of us were saying he left the restaurant and took the car home, leaving us stranded. Lucky for me, my sister lived nearby so I just asked her to pick us up and drop her off at her house. I left the kids there and took a taxi home, where I saw my husband in ethans room, taking out all of the 'masculine' clothes, as he called them, and taking some of Georgia's dresses and putting them in his wardrobe.

I confronted him and it lead to one of the biggest arguments we've has. At one point, he said the f slur which tilted me off the edge since he knew i was bisexual. It ended up with him leaving to his parents house and saying he doesn't know if he'll be back. I'm worried and don't know what to do now so can i get some help? I've told my kids to say at their aunties house for the night. AITA?",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-11-09,"AITA for blowing up on my husband after our son came out as trans to him?

She sold her previous house and put all of that money into buying this house with me. She couldn’t get a mortgage but made great money and basically put all of the $$$ down for the down payment and moving expenses. We both paid the mortgage and started a joint account for the house. I started the account and put $5000 in it and we each added the same amount each week to cover the bills and anything for the house. Living together was a mistake and she sent a text one day while I was at work that she talked to a realtor and she was putting the house on the market after 8 months of living there. The house sold quickly for about what we paid but not before the 1st buyer backed out. After the 1st buyer backed out she left me to pay the mortgage and utilities for the empty house. After a year and a half we were awarded the 1st buyer’s down payment of $32,000. I haven’t taken any money from the sale of the house at this point and I think $6000 would be fair. My ex thinks I should only get what I paid for the lawyer to fight for the down payment which was $2,750. I feel $6000 is fair.

To be clear:

We bought the house for $630,000

We sold it for $620,000. My girlfriend took all the funds from that transaction. 

Prior to selling it for $620,000 we accepted an offer of $640,000. This buyer walked away and her down payment was in escrow for about a year and a half. We had to go to court and they awarded us $32,000 which was her down payment. 

The lawyer cost $5,500 and we split that $2,750 each.

Now for context, any guitar players reading this, we trade and sell/upgrade our gear. Its just part of the hobby. But one of my old coworkers had a 1992 Les Paul Studio with the Ibanez Lawsuit case he offered to me for $800. 

I thought it was pretty good because ive played this guitar before and it sounds beautiful. A legit Les Paul has been one of, if not one of my dream guitars, aside from a custom shop Jackson. 

And it’s not like I’m working in fast food (no shame to the FF workers out there, mad respect to you guys). I work in the biggest hospital in my state/city. Im not hurting for money by any means. 

Anyways, when the offer came up i told him id get back to him about it and i let my parents know about it since it was a big purchase i was going to be making. 

This set mainly my mom (37) overboard. She went on about how it would be financially foolish and id go broke immediately, i already have guitars (because apparently i dont play them enough) and that id regret it later. She finished off by saying “whatever, im beating a dead horse” 

We ended up going to the store later that day and i thought i had pissed her off so I apologized and she said “why are you apologizing?” And i told her it was about the dead horse comment thinking i wasn’t listening. So she explained herself and explained that if i buy it now its stupid. 

Now i tell her that im not going to buy it right this instant and that i already have more than enough to pay for this and be comfortable. She asks me “why do you want this?” 

This is where i fumble because im not good at explaining myself. I tell her i want it because its a Les Paul and it has a good sound/tone to it. 

Her response was:
“You’re gonna spend $800 on a sound? Its a toy” 

This pissed me the fuck off. Mainly her saying it was a toy. I told her i wasn’t going to buy it to console her and to calm her down but i couldn’t stop thinking about that damm guitar. 

I remember playing it that day at my coworkers house and how beautiful it sounded and now i have the chance to buy it. 

I worked out a deal with my CW to get the guitar, but inevitably im going to feel a bit of shame for buying it. So, AITAH?

This pissed me the fuck off. Mainly her saying it was a toy. I told her i wasn’t going to buy it to console her and to calm her down but i couldn’t stop thinking about that damm guitar. 

I remember playing it that day at my coworkers house and how beautiful it sounded and now i have the chance to buy it.

She wanted some board and card games that we have, I have a game called ""New phone who this?"".

She had it at her house for over a year and i hadn't seen it since i brought it so when i saw it on her side i told her i was taking it back home.

She went off again after i had started yelling again saying watch your attitude, you've gotten so mouthy since you got with your boyfriend and saying she was going to slap my face off. 

She got one of my mums games and then left. My mum started going off at me saying my attitude was worse even though my sister got in my face and was basically spitting on me.

Fast forward to now, she leaves her ugg slippers out and my dog nibbles the end of one - not unwearable and not unfixable, also bare in mind she has told me she wants new ones as hers look like they’ve survived a war. I b apologised and offered some money towards not expecting her to want some considering the above. 

However now she has messaged asking me to transfer money for the Uggs - I’m stuck because obviously I feel bad and don’t want things to be awkward but considering she never paid for my stuff that got destroyed and told me not to leave out I’m less inclined to pay. I’m happy to give a small amount towards but when I’ve spoken to other friends they’ve told me not too until she gives me the money for my items that got ruined - which is clearly never going to happen. If it was a brand new pair that she had no intentions on replacing I would be more inclined but it just feels like she almost left them out to get chewed so she didn’t have to pay for them

With all of this, I can already tell that the holidays will be quiet and somber. Last year’s Christmas was disappointing: we tried to go out, but my dad didn’t feel up for it and stayed in his room. My mom was down, my brothers were glued to their screens, and I ended up ordering takeout and watching “love actually” alone (again).

After my exams this year all I wanted was a little excitement—a nice outing, a short trip, a get together, ANYTHING. My best friend (19F) decided to be my saving grace and invited me to her hometown for the holidays. It’s 8 hours away by car, in a tourist spot I’ve always wanted to visit, and we planned to meet up with friends and celebrate her 19th birthday. Her family was totally supportive, and I thought it’d be a refreshing break after a hard year.

But when I told my mom, she protested. Her reasons ranged from “It’s too far” to “Who will do your chores?” and finally, “Why would you want to spend Christmas with another family?” I get that it’d feel strange to her, and maybe she’d feel sad if I weren’t there. But if I stay, I’ll probably spend another holiday alone in my room.

I wouldn’t go if I thought my family would be genuinely upset by my absence on such a family-centered holiday, but honestly, whether I’m there or not won’t make a big difference—we’re not that type of family.

The trip with my friend is only for a week out of the two-month holiday before school resumes. I don’t plan on going out much so I’ll still be spending plenty of time with my family at home during the rest of the holidays. It’s not about avoiding them—I just want to enjoy this time in my life and have a change of scenery, especially after always having mediocre holidays.

Three years ago, Kie and I had our first child (currently 3M). It was a little while after this that Rosie came to talk to me and asked me if it would make me uncomfortable if she called me mum. I know that I'm not the woman that birthed her and that biologically, I'm not her mum, but I was okay with it if that was what she wanted to call me - because the love that I feel for her is very much motherly. 

I'd never talked to her about it before this point and she always called me by my name, I wanted to give her the space to talk to me about it if she ever wanted to or if she didn't. My main concern was always what she was comfortable with. I talked to Kie about it later and he said the same thing, that he didn't really care as long as both Rosie and I were okay with it.

Last night was one of the nights that Rosie's mum had pre-organised to see her as it's her birthday soon, and so Rosie went off with her mum for dinner and it was all good. When they got back later, Riley asked if she could talk to me and so I said yes (figuring it was probably about Rosie) and she basically got very angry that I had told Rosie it would be okay for her to call me mum, went off on one saying that I'm not her mum, that I've got my own kid and I can fuck off trying to play happy family with Rosie. I told her that I understood I hadn't birthed her but that it was Rosie's choice.

Riley kind of stormed out after and I understand why she's upset; but considering that Rosie came to me on her own terms and asked I don't see how I'm the problem. That being said I can understand how much it would hurt her mum, but I just don't see how it could be a bad thing for three adults to love her so much instead of two.

A little backgroundstory: In our friend group, physical closeness has always been normal and accepted. My fiancé and I aren’t overly affectionate in front of our friends or engage in intense displays. Light physical affection however, is common for everyone in the group. There’s another couple in the group who often sit close, hug or put an arm around each other. When this friend had a partner, she also openly showed affection toward him and with other friends. Hugging, sitting close or sharing a blanket during a movie has always been part of the group’s dynamic. That's why I didn't expect this request, especially from her.

I responded saying I’m so sorry she's struggling with this. And I appreciate that she reached out. But that I’d like some time to think it over and discuss it with my fiancé. I suggested it was better to talk about it on the phone rather than texting.

She replied, saying she preferred not to discuss it by phone as it was too emotional. After talking it over with my fiancé, I replied:

I (29F) was on the subway this last Thursday with my bf (35M) as I was going to a doctor's appointment and he was accompanying me. The subway wasn't crowded but there were no seats available. Eventually one opened up and I sat down since I have back problems that make standing up for too long very painful, and my bf stayed up. Not long after that, the seat next to me went vacant so he sat down, and right by our side there was a preferencial seat. 

Then, an elderly couple came in, an old man with a cane and an old woman, his wife I assume. The man sat down on the preferencial seat and the old woman stood right in front of him and my bf. I quietly and politely said to him ""babe, give up your seat to the old lady"", and he did, and I was so happy cause I find being kind to others something very important, I even said he was a gentleman. 

But I later noticed his mood had shifted, so I asked what was wrong, and he started complaining to me that he didn't want to give up his seat, that I had no place in making him get up for the old lady, that she was not gonna have to deal with the long subway journey he was gonna have to take on (it's like almost 2 hours from where I live to the doctor's office, São Paulo is a huge city) and when I said ""but she's old, what about being kind to old people?"" he said that he was not in the mood that day to be kind to anyone. I asked ""what if it was your elderly mom?"" and he answered ""she would have to stand too"" and I was baffled, I got very upset but dropped the subject. 

When he noticed I got upset he got even more defensive about his actions and reasons. I told him ""if I had known you were going to make such a big deal out of this, I would have given up my seat even with my back problems because some things are more important than being in a ""mood"". 

I'm still upset but I need to know if I was wrong in the first place for making him give up his seat. It was not my intention to make him mad, I just didn't want to see the little old lady standing up. 

Edit: I didn't stand up myself because like I said, I have back problems that make standing up painful. 

Edit 2: Guys, thanks for helping me understand that the way I spoke with him, telling him what to do, was the actual problem after all. I'll talk to him about it and apologize. Bless you all!

I (22F) love Christmas. I love everything about it, the music, the decoration, making (not eating, admittedly) food, Christmas films, everything, and have loved her since I was a baby listening to The Nutcracker all the time. My father also really likes Christmas, and we always host the family’s Christmas party at home, since our house is the biggest of all of my uncles and aunts, etc.

My mother (53F) hates Christmas. She always says that. All she sees is the bad side of Christmas.  She doesn’t like the crowds, the endless events, the extra work, the “fakeness”. She always makes Christmas stressful for everybody by always mentioning often and out loud just how much she hates that time of year. She calls herself the grinch, and she always says she would love to spend Christmas in a hotel room in another country, just us, in pyjamas, without any family, decoration, dinner, crowds, nothing. I have stoped trying to make her see the fun side of Christmas and just try my best to ignore her and have my joy, and that’s it. 

However, she likes decor. She loves setting the table, making flower arrangements, etc. She’s always the one to do it, and I don’t interfere. She always sticks to the theme, though in recent years she has gone for a more “Pinterest”, “decor magazine”, “aesthetic” vibe than I personally would like (i like that very traditional, classic, whimsical Christmas with nutcrackers, toys, sugar canes, gingerbread houses, red, green and gold, etc etc, while she has in recent years gone for more fashionable aesthetics with winter animals, plaid white and red, etc. It’s not ugly at all, just not my personal taste, and I let her be just fine). 

The tree has always been my thing. I find a lot of joy in putting up the tree and decorating - every year with the exact same decor, which includes tons of gingerbread biscuit inspired ornaments, nutcrackers, etc etc. Every single year she complains about the tree - it’s not organised, fashionable, current enough for her, and it’s always the same. Every year she does nothing about it, and every year I keep it as is. I love it, my father loves it. Many of those decorations are as old as me. Many were bought in trips we made. It’s an affectionate tree that looks like what I think a Christmas tree is supposed to look like, like it was put together in an afternoon with Christmas music playing in the background and surrounded by boxes and boxes of stuff we love.

This year she’s hellbent of doing the tree herself, and we’ve been fighting about it at least once a week for the last month. She wants a modern Christmas tree, with all new ornaments, all organised (I wanna say symmetrical, but that’s not the word. She wants a tree that looks like it was designed, instead of what I do, which is just randomly distributing the ornaments) and less chaotic, with more white and red and less of my “tacky” style decor with glitter and colours and etc. She has talked of HIRING a woman who is famous-ish in my city for decorating nice, magazine worthy Christmas trees.

I find that preposterous. What is the point of a Christmas tree that somebody else decorated for you? What is the point of any of it? It takes away all the affection, the meaning and the spirit of Christmas. It’s a commercial thing. It’s soulless. It’s the equivalent of bringing corporate talk into your house. I’m not saying it would look ugly - again, I don’t like it, but objectively I know it’s fine - but it would honestly destroy my Christmas. I don’t think I would feel ok with looking at it. 

My problem, that she doesn’t see, is that she has no concept of a Christmas spirit at all. For her what matters is that the tree looks good. The fact that it has no history and wasn’t put up by was is absolutely indifferent to her, because *she doesn’t care about christmas*. But I do. 

She says it’s her house and she’ll do what she wants, and that she’s tired of being a slave to my whims when it comes to the Christmas tree. I say that she despises Christmas anyways, so I think it’s unfair that she would take it away from us who like it. She says exactly because she hates Christmas we should let her do the things she does like about it - that is, the decorating aspects of it. I say if she decides to take over the Christmas tree, she should rid herself of any illusions that I will do anything at all for it - since obviously in her head she wants me to be on board and participate with her, but I fundamentally disagree with all the Christmas tree ideas she has - or acknowledge it at all. I feel I’m being very dramatic, but I have extremely visceral feelings about this and i can’t help it.

So, AITA?

Christmas with my family is a ton of gifts every year- for my parents, brother, SIL, and their three kids (12, 16, and 22). My mom gives a lot of gifts and while it is very sweet, it’s a lot of things to lug home every year. We have a VERY small house and too much stuff already, and honestly the gifts aren’t always things we want or need. The last couple years we’ve been selling a lot of the extra crap on marketplace (after smiling and thanking profusely of course). We just don’t have room for all the things my mom gets us, especially since she also gets us gifts for birthdays, Mother’s Day/Father’s Day, and gets the baby multiple gifts for every holiday (literally- Halloween, Easter, Valentine’s Day, you name it). 

Wife and I were talking about if our oldest nephew is too old to get a gift for (at 22, we weren’t getting gifts from aunts and uncles anymore), and it led to us to talking about how much money we’re going to spend on gifts this year, and how little room we have in our house. Important is that we are one income as of last year as my wife is taking child rearing leave to be home with the baby. We can swing it but it is very tight, by no means are we rich, we’re just keeping our finances tight in order to afford it. 

We decide now that we have our own kid too, it would be a good idea to see if we can only exchange kid gifts with my brother’s family. I talked to my brother and he loved the idea, so we agreed to only get gifts for each others’ children. I then messaged my mom, who had asked me earlier that day what we want for Christmas. I told her I was thinking about it and we don’t need anything, and would like to just enjoy our time together this Christmas and don’t need gifts for us. I know she wants to buy the baby gifts so I said feel free to get her a couple things but don’t worry about us. She seemed perfectly fine with it, clarified not to get anything for them either, and the conversation ended. 

Ten minutes later, she messages again asking why I’ve blindsided her out of left field and how can I be so inconsiderate. (Note- my mom can be extremely emotional and dramatic, and a bit narcissistic especially ever since I got married.) I calmly explained that this is the best decision for us because we have a small house and are on one income now, and wanted to enjoy the holiday together without worrying about the material aspect as much, while still keeping the gift magic for the kids. (I also never said my parents and brother/SIL shouldn’t exchange gifts, that has nothing to do with us). She replied that I was insulting her, calling her materialistic, ruining Christmas, and an AH. I stepped back from the argument at that point because I’ve been here a million times and I know she’s not going to absorb anything I say, will make herself the victim no matter how nice I am, and no progress will be made.

The problem is that he's getting married next weekend, and his fiancee (28F) is upset and claiming that we are ""abandoning"" her by going because ""there is so much still to do."" My girlfriend (27F, and the maid of honor) is taking her side.

The thing is that everything that could be possibly booked, reserved, or rented has already been taken care of.  As far as I know, the only thing being tackled tomorrow is them making DIY centerpieces out of candles, glass bowls, and fake flowers.  And if we were there, we'd end up being in the way or ""not doing it right"" and shooed off to the den after an hour, where we'd end up watching the game on TV anyway.

Am I the asshole?",No A-holes here,2024-11-09,"AITA for going to an NFL game with a friend before his wedding? I (29M) won 2 tickets to an NFL game this weekend and decided to bring along my best friend (29M).  We are both diehard fans and it should be a fun day.

The problem is that he's getting married next weekend, and his fiancee (28F) is upset and claiming that we are ""abandoning"" her by going because ""there is so much still to do."" My girlfriend (27F, and the maid of honor) is taking her side.

The thing is that everything that could be possibly booked, reserved, or rented has already been taken care of.  As far as I know, the only thing being tackled tomorrow is them making DIY centerpieces out of candles, glass bowls, and fake flowers.  And if we were there, we'd end up being in the way or ""not doing it right"" and shooed off to the den after an hour, where we'd end up watching the game on TV anyway.

My bf got this as well and it cost an extra $6 on top of the $18 it was for the ice cream. He paid for it as his treat, even though I think he didn’t expect it to be so expensive. When I started to eat I realised it was bits of peanut. I’m not allergic but I don’t really like nuts that much, especially on sweet ice cream when the flavours don’t match up. 

I started to try to pick off the nuts, but most of them were stuck on pretty hard. I eventually just ripped off the entire chocolate part of the cone and threw it in the bin. I didn’t notice my bf at first but about 30 seconds later he stormed off, and I could see he was crying, something I haven’t seen him do ever before. 

I chased after him and asked him what was wrong and he yelled at me for being ungrateful, and for ‘making him literally throw away his money for no reason’. This made me very upset as well, and I started crying too. He calmed down and comforted me after this, but never properly apologised. 

For some additional context, earlier that day we went to my favourite fast food place, and I picked out something that I hadn’t tried before rather than my regular. He paid for it but I didn’t end up eating it because I didn’t really like it, so I let him have it. I felt hungry after that and after I told him he took me to get ice cream. 

Since I got home that day he hasn’t messaged me back at all, and I’m started to get worried. AITA?

Tldr: I threw out the chocolate/nuts part of the ice cream my bf got for me, and he yelled at me.

We’re only just finishing the first trimester, and recently I received a text from a family acquaintance congratulating us—turns out they’d run into my MIL that morning, and she’d shared the news. This isn’t the first time she’s gone against our wishes. Around six weeks, we learned she’d told an extended family member, even though we had specifically said we weren’t ready to make it public and wanted to tell people ourselves when we felt comfortable.

I feel hurt and frustrated that she’s not respecting our wishes. I made it clear that I wasn’t ready for this to be public knowledge, especially given my anxiety surrounding this pregnancy. I think I have a right to decide who I tell and when, especially with something so sensitive.

My husband is also frustrated by his mom’s actions and understands why this is so upsetting for me. However, he’s hesitant to actually confront her about it. He feels that saying something would make her uncomfortable and potentially strain their relationship. He told me that if I feel strongly about it, I should be the one to address it with her directly.

He just returned from a family cruise, and we hadn’t been able to talk for several days. The night he got back, I started getting emotional. It hit me hard that the main reason he lives so far from his family, especially now when they might need him, is because of me.

When we went to bed, I tried to brush it off, but I couldn’t, and I ended up crying. He noticed and asked what was wrong, so I told him. He got frustrated and said I always find random things to get upset about. I admit that I’m a pretty sensitive person, but I was just feeling guilty. I know he could get a job close to his family, and he’s even mentioned before that he sometimes regrets not staying in that town.

When I tried to talk it out and apologize, he only got more annoyed. Now I’m wondering if I’m the AH for bringing this up and being so emotional about it.

His dad's wife discovered this and wanted to be the one walking him down the aisle and dancing with him. But my fiancé, and both of his sisters actually, have not got the best relationship with this woman. While their relationship with their dad is pretty okay. Not very close but not super distant either. But his wife is another story. My fiancé first met her when he was 10 and his sisters were 13 and 15. Their mom died a year earlier, which their dad's decision to remarry that fast did add some strain to their relationship because they don't feel like he considered them at all. When my fiancé met her he thought she was okay but by the time the wedding was approaching he realized she wanted to be more of a mother to him She wanted the girls as her bridesmaids and my fiancé ""her son"" to walk her down the aisle. None of them wanted to do this. After the wedding, when she wanted my fiancé to allow her to step into the role of mother for him, it grew more tense and unfriendly. My fiancé felt like she forced the issue too much. She felt like he should have been more accepting of a second mother in his life. The tension grew when she realized she was truly not even seen as second best by him but was not seen as anything beyond his dad's wife.

His dad's wife already asked requested he let her walk him and dance. He clearly said no. There was a fight over her feeling like his mother and him laying down the fact he has never considered her to be anything of a mother to him. When she couldn't get through to him, she tried to go through me. Using the fact I was adopted and my parents adopted me to do this. She told me I know all about blood not meaning parent. Which is true, I do. My fiancé doesn't feel this way because his mom was biologically related to him. But because she was there for to him and she was the one who raised him. Which is how I feel about my parents and it's a whole thing. I told her it was my fiancé's decision and I would not force him to do anything he doesn't want to. She told me for the future of my future family I must and I should as a woman who has no genetic family. This got under my skin and I told her that she is not winning any points with me by talking to me like that and that I would never betray my fiancé for her. I also told her she needed to back off and accept that she does not have a place in their hearts and forcing herself onto them will not help. She was furious with me and called me a bad daughter in-law. Then she texted me about it afterward and told me I owe her an apology.

I 17F am turning 18 in a couple days. I’ve been having a lot of medical issues the last couple months. Don’t know if anyone knows what this is but I’ve had cellulitis twice in the last 4 months and over 25 abscess’s a lot of which I’ve had to get lanced. Anyways, if you don’t know what that is you can google it but the point is that I’ve been miserable and in a lot of pain for a while now to the point where I can barely walk let alone go to school.

And my dad calls me up today and informs me that he went behind my back (after I told him days prior that I was having a bad flare up and haven’t been able to leave my bed for days because I was in so much pain and that I wouldn’t be able to celebrate my birthday) that he booked a reservation at a fancy restaurant for me and my entire family to go to tomorrow to celebrate my birthday. He also knows I fucking hate the food at this restaurant lol.

I asked him if we could reschedule for next week and reminded him of what I had told him a few days prior and that I would just be in pain the entire dinner if I went and wouldn’t be able to wear the appropriate clothes to a place like that because I can’t wear anything but baggy clothes right now because of pressure on the abscesses really hurts me. He told me that he didn’t care and I would have to suck it up and go because he put a deposit down. 

I went to my mom and started crying that I didn’t think I could go because of how much pain I was in and she said that it’s just a couple hours and I should just go so his money he put down on the deposit doesn’t go to waste and that I was being selfish which just made me feel even shittier than I already do.

Problems are arising. At night, she gets to decide when I get off my computer. If she wants to go to sleep, even if it's 12AM on the weekend, I have to get off my computer for the night (note, I rarely have time to play on week-days because I'm so busy from school/other work). However, I find this unfair. My brothers, they can stay up however long they'd like. If I even argue with my sister, she goes and tells my mom, who becomes angry with me. Because of this, I'm unable to play with my friends who live across the globe and are only available during these hours. There's no warning either. If she wants to go to bed, I have to get off then and there. This isn't the only issue, either. It's pretty obvious that I'm very introverted, and prefer not talking to anyone. My family knows this, yet my sister doesn't seem to care. She will try to make useless conversation with me whenever. And if I tell her to shut up or stop talking, straight to mom she goes. Basically, my life has become a living hell. No privacy (which I would really like!), unfair rules, and overall just annoying behavior has suddenly come into my life. Because of this, I have become increasingly bitter towards my family. I'm irritable, will often get into arguments, and it's getting worse by the day. Anything my sister says, goes, because ""she's an adult"" (the reason given by my mom). Not too long ago, she came up and told me to get off my computer mid-game because she wanted to sleep. I said no. Of course, she went and woke my mom up. I was called over to my moms room, and we had an argument about my privacy and how this is unfair. Now, arguments like these have become really common. In the past, during arguments, I've told my mom that a ""failure of a person"" (words like this are what I think could make me the AH) should not dictate my lifestyle. I told her that I ""can't wait to get out of this idiot household"" because she refuses to adknowledge the points I make. I've said things like ""a hardworking and stressed student should not have to go by the rules of a lousy dropout who spent all this money on college for nothing and can barely even get a job"". I've tried telling my mom how I feel about this, but she always pushes me away and tells me that we will ""talk later"", and that I should not argue with her.

So, my mom has told me that I'm becoming a ""bully"" for the way I've been acting. I feel like there can be a debate on this when you really look at both sides.

To give some context, my friend comes from a very controlling family. They’ve always done everything for her, to the point where she struggles with even basic tasks on her own. When she moved out for college, she found it overwhelming and had a tough time adjusting. She’s grown more independent since then, graduating college and completing a master’s degree. But the family dynamic hasn’t changed.

One thing about her is that she’s nonconfrontational—she avoids upsetting others, even when they treat her poorly. This is especially true with her family, who often gang up on her when she doesn’t meet their expectations or do things their way. Recently, she got a job as a cashier at an electronics store. Her family was unhappy about it, criticizing her for taking a “low” job with her master’s degree. She’s working there temporarily to save up money until she can find something more aligned with her field, which I think is completely reasonable.

The problem started when her family began pressuring her to quit. She became frustrated with the job and started venting to me. On her first day, she complained that her coworkers weren’t constantly beside her, and she was assigned actual tasks. She also criticized her schedule, which is tough: two 12-hour shifts followed by two days off. I understand it’s exhausting, but I couldn’t help feeling frustrated by her constant complaining.

Here’s where I might have messed up. I recently started a new job at a bank, and the training has been very draining. One day, I came home wanting to rest, but she continued to vent about her job without asking how mine was going. She also mentioned feeling sick after dressing too lightly in cold weather. At that point, I snapped a little and told her that if she hated the job so much, she should quit.

This morning, things escalated when she told me her mom had asked how work was going and added, “I hope you know how dangerous it is to work as a cashier.” My friend agreed with her mom, and that’s when I lost my patience. I told her I was tired of how coddled she was by her family, and that she needed to stop letting them treat her like a child. I said she’s 24 years old and needs to start acting like an adult because no job is problem-free. I also told her she needed to talk to her family about it, because it wasn’t my place to keep “parenting” her.

She didn’t get upset, but I felt guilty afterward. I don’t usually snap at her like that, and I know I was mentally exhausted from my own work stress. Still, I’m wondering if I overstepped. I didn’t yell or get aggressive, but I feel like I may not have given her the support she needed. Should I apologize?

I have been paying the interest for the money I lent him because of the nature of business we have. 

Regardless of how much of a scumbag he has been and how much he has been lying and deceiving me, I have still been kind and respectful towards him despite him being on a much lower post than I am. 

More times than not I have gotten fed up of asking him back my money. Due to circumstances, I had been posted on duty in some other place now and the guy will not receive my phone call once his duty hours are over and also is being a scum bag by being arrogant at times with his tone and attitude. 

As a fair warning, I had even taken away his phone once for a couple days which I returned back to him by making him promise me to return back my money which he has taken. But he still has not. 

He is least bothered. Goes on trips, uses Facebook, Instagram, puts up WhatsApp status about humanity and shit every day but won’t receive my calls. He even has good clothing and accessories. Uses a fairly good phone for his standards and also has purchased a new bike recently.

That’s why I again confiscated his phone but my conscience says I’m not that kind of person. I even went through his phone to check his bank balance and his transactions and find out his other nuances which he has been lying to me about. So AITH for doing this to him?

Basically , my boyfriend and I live in an ADU with my mom and grandma. My aunts father owns this house. He has always seemed to have a problem with us living here. He married my grandmas sister and my grandma is currently in critical condition and is 94 years old. My grandma is really the only reason why they offered to rent us this home at a ""cheap price"". The owner of the house has always made comments to other people in the family saying he is loosing out on a lot of money by having us live here. 
Not only that but, my boyfriend happpens to work for the husband of one of their cousins. They seem to have some issues with the husband. I don't know exactly why but to me, it seems like it's pure envy. 
Now as to how this beef started... one day one of my aunts shows up and parks her car in the property and then comes to ask if my boyfriend can park his car out on the street so he won't be blocking the people who live in the main house if they want to get out. This seems reasonable however, she was the one who was blocking because she parked her car right in front of the gap we use to exit the driveway. Whatever, we choose to ignore it and we move the car but, I called my mom and told her what happened. My aunt said not to worry, it was just for today. 
Next day, the aunt comes back. We had our front door open so she just comes in and peeks her head through. She continues to tell me that she told me my boyfriends car had to be parked outside and suddenly she says there is rule that only allows us to have 2 cars parked in our driveway. This rule NEVER existed before. She gives me attitude so I tell her that I will move the car but anything that has to do with the house rules, she needs to talk to my mom about because I can't get involved. She finds this offensive someway and continues to say ""I am telling you NOW, it is only 2 cars"". Extremely rude tone and all. I don't want any problems so I say okay and go move the car. 
Before I can even tell my mom what happens she calls my mom and tells her herself. She tells my mom many nasty things about me and says that she never agreed to have my boyfriend and I live here. Mind you , I am here to help my mom care for my sick grandma. My mom tells her that she can't expect her to kick out her own daughter and the aunt continues to say ""She's not the problem. Her boyfriend is."". From here, I know she told my mom many nasty things about me but my mom just doesn't want to tell me. The aunt and my mom are not on good terms right now. 

My sisters baby shower is now coming up and those 2 aunts have already RSVP. I don't feel comfortable going but, I also do not want to hurt my sisters feelings.

I went to the residential team. I reported that my things had been getting stolen, and that the kitchen at that point was a sate due to the mould festering in the bins and in the sink. We got threatened with a fine. This is the only time that everyone in the flat has bothered cleaning up. There was also shit on the bathroom wall.

The cleanliness has been brought up several times. The only reason why I use the kitchen was to cook. I've asked people to clean up, as the sinks and bins were coated in mould, and I had to bin things from the fridge due to the mould. There were other maintenance issues, which all got brought up. There is also a fire door in between my flat block and another, and people had been using it to get in between the flats. Maintenance sent in cleaners, cleaned the mould, and fixed the door.

I will put my hands up and say I have been an AH due to my things being stolen- in the heat of anger, and due to my family suggesting it, i did buy some fibre powder, and put it into my squash so that the people who were taking it would have to put up with a very gritty gelatine. I did check the labels and that it wouldn't be dangerous - it was literally just powdered fibre. I ended up binning it and apologised. 

The interconnecting door got kicked in, and people put things under it so it wouldn't shut. Maintenance found out when they checked on the mould in the shower, and we got threatened with discipline and it got fixed once more. Things kicked off, and I got threatened and blamed for it, even though I have got proof that it was not me, and at the time I was bedridden.

A couple of nights ago, I made a few Tiktoks, taking the piss about the state of the flat. I had thought my account was private - I bounce between it being public and private - and posted them. I put as one of the captions 'i live with a bunch of skanks', which is a very strong choice of word, and at the time I was very angry, but I will say it was a dick move to use that word specifically. I woke up yesterday to the entire flat kicking off to me because they saw it, and it turns out I had made my account public and had forgotten about it, and this led to them seeing it.

I have been in a relationship with my bf since January 2024. Both have kiddos middle school aged, and live 1.5 hours away from each other. 

He has two friends that he has known since grade school. They both live in florida and live significantly different lives then he does. One of the friends (R) is a wealthy attorney, and the other (J) is a dental surgeon of sorts. I have not met them. 

Estranged for a number of years, he reconnected with them about 5 years ago and has met up with them a couple times in the hometown he grew up in and talk every day via group text. Since the beginning of a relationship, my boyfriend has told me many things about these two and the group chat. Specifically both of these individuals are divorced- (R) is in and out with his ex and baby mom while dating and seeing women on the side- and then (J) just recently asked for a divorce and has a hidden life of having orgies on boats in florida with p*** stars and paid escorts. A lot of which he shares in the group text. Pictures of the women and them having s*×, sharing intimate details about the acts. All of which were hidden by his wife. My boyfriend says he doesn't encourage it, but it's J's life and he can't do anything about it despite trying to have conversations with him about how it's inappropriate and he should lead a better life. 

Because these guys share so much intimate information, I worry that my personal details have also been shared. Well I know they have because while my boyfriend was showing me a text. He sent to the guys.He forgot that he included: 

""My P*$$y is coming over tonight"" at the end of the text he sent. To which I took GREAT concern. 

He says it was ""guy talk"".

He told me the other day the guys and him are planning to meet up soon at a place like Cabo for a week. He says I have nothing to worry about. I told him I'm not comfortable with him going, especially since those guys have a reputation. He exclaimed he shouldn't have even told me about their lives and that it was wrong of him to share it. He also said I have nothing to worry about because he's with me and wants to be with me and no one else. I caught him on fb dating some time ago- of course denied it- and I like a fool put it to the side. 

I told him I didn't want him to go and that if he went, I would not communicate with him while he was there and my values don't line up with that behavior. I think it may cause a breakup if he goes- yes, despite them being close friends since childhood.

Original post:

My wife (57F) and I (55M) have been together for a long time. I have never been a fan of my in-laws. Over the years, they have become increasingly openly racist. Whenever they said something awful in the past, I would just go for a walk. Then our children came along, and nothing changed. We would still attend holiday gatherings, but when the in-laws would start behaving badly, we would leave. I was blamed for cutting things short and asked to apologize. I never did, and my wife never explained that we did not want our children around such hateful behavior.

When our children’s neurodiversity became obvious, and I recognized my own, things got worse. Thanksgiving dinner devolved into the grandparents repeatedly telling our children to stop small things like anxious hair twirling and tics that they could not control. The last time we were at a holiday gathering, my children were clearly uncomfortable with the way they were being treated. We started to leave but then the kids felt bad because they love their grandparents. I ended up leaving by myself. I stopped going to these events, but I did not stop anyone else from doing the same.

Over the past few years, their talk has even worn my wife down. She doesn’t even like talking to them on the phone. Well, on a recent phone call, she laid into them about how awful the things they say are. They were shocked that she had such a low opinion of them. There was no apology, just lame excuses and rationalizations that my wife accepted. They were on speakerphone and I heard everything.

After that, we were asked to join Thanksgiving dinner again as they are getting old and have medical issues. I agreed because I heard them make a serious attempt to look better to my wife. Well, it has been a week and they are back saying horrible things. My wife asked me to keep quiet when we go. I told her I was quiet for years and I won't do it again. She has decided we should not go (kids included) and is upset with me. TBH our holiday dinners have been so quiet and relaxing just on our own for the past few years that I don't mind. At the same time, I was an orphan and do not have any real attachment to anyone but my kids. Right now there is no argument and the plans seem final. WIBTA for letting the plan stand and my wife not seeing her elderly parents because they cannot keep things civil?

ETA: The kids are 17 and 22. They can make their own choices. Plus spelling and grammar errors. 

ETA 2: Timeline and filling in more blanks. For a decade I put up with it. When the kids were older, I did become more and more vocal about it. I left there screaming more than once over the next decade. And then decided to just stop going and didn't for a decade. We did Thanksgiving at home for years. Covid helped. The main excuse to go over the past few years for my family is they are old and don't know what they are saying. I have spent the past few holidays alone at home and I've been fine with that. The only reason I am considering this is a sudden decline in health for one of the grandparents.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-09,"WIBTA for accepting my SO's final say on Thanksgiving plans this year?

The first time we had an issue was when she answered the phone for him one night. I work late nights so I walk myself back to my dorm. I make a point to be on the phone with my mom or my bf as a precaution. My bf knows this and typically answers the phone when I call. That night, my bf was at her house, so when she saw my name pop up on the screen she took the phone from his hand and answered. When I heard her voice I didn’t know it was her so I kept saying hello bc I thought I called someone else. She didn’t hear me and said “You know it’s rude not to answer.” I replied “Sorry I was just trying to call Matt.” She replied that he’s busy. I was annoyed and just wanted to get back to my dorm so I told him that I’ll talk to him later.
For context, my bf and I had only started dating atp so to me it seemed like a one off thing. Until, my bf’s mom bought him tickets for a ball down at the church where his family attends. At first everything was going good. My bf had told me that his cousin isn’t coming to the event so I wasn’t expecting her. About 40 mins after we arrived, his cousin came in looking high and drunk. She came up to our table and spoke to everyone except me. Once she was done talking she came up to me and started bringing up the night of the phone call and how rude I was for “ignoring her” and “talking to her crazy.” I apologized to her. She ignored it and started going on a rant about how she’s the most important person in his (my bf’s) life and how she’s like a second mother to him. While this was happening everyone at the table except my bf didn’t hear what she said to me bc of the loud music. After her rant she started hugging me for like 2 minutes, then gave me a “do you understand, pookie?” and went off to the dance floor.

I instantly felt like shit, and was mostly upset that my bf or my grandma didn’t stand up for me at that moment. My feelings got hurt more bc she made a comment about my weight to my bf’s mother and they both laughed. After dinner I went to the bathroom to cry without making a scene and it took one of the ladies from my bf’s church to comfort me before I came out. 

After the ball, my mom picked me up and I called my bf to tell him how I felt. He told me that she was just being overprotective of him and that she was high.He also stated that she’s the closest person to him in his family, which makes it tougher to call her out. My bf says that I should try to apologize to her and be amicable so we can build a relationship but I don’t want to. I told him I want him to confront his cousin and set boundaries with her so this doesn’t happen again. He says I’m being over dramatic.AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-09,"AITA for wanting my bf to stand up to his cousin?

The breakup was for the best. He was kind of a good person but not what I needed to as a future father and husband. My best friend (33M), who’s known me since childhood, disliked my ex for various/valid reasons and was glad when we split. Now, two years later, I’m engaged to a wonderful man who has been incredibly supportive as my health declined, including a recent cancer diagnosis. My fiancé is well-off and covering our wedding and house, but I still wanted to at least buy my own wedding dress without help. I mentioned this to my best friend. He wanted to pitch in but I didn't want to be a burden and said I'd figure it out (I can't work).

Soon after, I got an email from my ex, saying he didn’t have the money yet and still owed his dad. Turns out my best friend sent him a message on my behalf, asking for repayment, saying my fiancé was uncomfortable with an unpaid loan from my ex. When I confronted my best friend, he admitted to sending it out of frustration and wanting to support me.

Then I received an angry voice note from my ex, berating me for demanding money he didn’t have, and calling me mentally slow for trying to respond to him after saying he'd pay me back like he promised but never wants to hear from me again. I only responded out of panic since I had no idea what was going on. I didn't want to blame my best friend in case he didn't believe me. He told me I shouldn’t be marrying if I’m “crying over a couple hundred dollars.” These comments stung, especially since he knew about my health issues from when we were together. Hurt, I told him I didn’t want the money and blocked him. Apparently he still owed his dad thousands of dollars.

When my best friend arrived and I was on a call, he sent another message to my ex from my email, explaining that I had cancer and was just trying to help my fiancé with wedding expenses even though he's well off to pay for it, clarifying I wasn't marrying a broke man like him, I just wanted to help to feel less of a burden. He said I’d lost respect for him because of his angry and hurtful response. My friends support what my best friend did, but one said he crossed a boundary by using my phone without permission and that I should cut him off. I understand my best friend was only trying to help me, but I’m conflicted about whether he went too far. They think I'm in the wrong because now he might do this to other people and possibly me as well?

>>>>>>> aaed1e67341ffdd97f5b4d6357238b5d09399ca9

**Background:**

* On Sunday afternoon (before Sofia asked me if I was okay), I texted her about opening the blinds in our room and asked if anyone could see in (we live on the third floor).
* On Monday night, I came in late and was mumbling to myself about the mess in the apartment. My roommates hadn’t cleaned the stove, and the dishes had piled up. I sometimes mumble when I’m stressed.

**The Situation:** On Wednesday, the resident director (RD) came to check on me after receiving a report that I wasn’t doing well. I was confused, so I explained to him that Sofia had asked about me being stalked and that I wasn’t. I also mentioned this to another roommate, Leah. Later, I got an email saying the RD was coming over to discuss our roommate agreement, which I thought was going to be about cleanliness, so I was relieved.

When the meeting began, Leah and the others shared that they wanted the apartment to feel like a safe space for open communication. Then, Sofia said she heard me on the phone with the police saying I was being stalked. She also brought up the text I sent about the blinds and mentioned seeing me mumbling to myself. She said she was concerned for me.

**Here’s where Sofia thinks I’m TA:**  
I apologized for causing concern, but I explained again that I wasn’t stalked. I showed everyone my phone to prove I didn’t make any calls. Sofia said that wasn’t fair—how would I feel if I saw something and the other person dismissed it as a dream? She insisted I must have called someone on another platform, dismissing my proof.

Some people think Sofia may have had an auditory hallucination, some think she had a bad dream, and some think she’s lying to get me in trouble.

I needed to go to the store today. I was alone and I’m far too proud to use a scooter, because 1). I’m very young and don’t look old enough to use one and 2). I’ve put on a good bit of weight from the steroids that were part of my chemo regimen, so I feel embarrassed using a scooter or really any type of mobility aid because I know it just makes it seem like I’m too lazy to walk. So I powered through and walked. I’m still in the process of getting a handicap placard, and there were no parking spaces close to the store, so I had to park a good ways away. By the time I got inside, I was already exhausted and also needed to pee, so I headed to the bathroom and into the disabled stall because it had  railings to hold on to whereas the “regular” stalls did not. When I finished, I opened the door only to see a woman in a wheelchair sitting there, waiting to use it. She gave me a really dirty look, rolled her eyes, and wheeled into the stall. I didn’t say anything, but it left me wondering if I was in the wrong.

I told my parents that i want to study abroad, and the first thing my dad tells me is no because its too far, unsafe, and i 'dont have that right' and its 'not normal' and i should follow what my other family members do lol...

anyways i ask my mom and she says i would only be allowed to go if she went with me😭 thats honestly just so ridiculous and so embarrassing. this whole thing is so frustrating. no matter what i do, how i try to convince them and talk through the whole program with them, they wont listen. Another thing that doesnt help is that earlier this year, my sister left with no trace, so now theyre even MORE cautious with the things i do (wonder why she left huh😏)

i know what youre probably thinking, im a full adult and i shouldnt need their approval and i should go regardless of their words, but my family is arab and very communal and an option like that is so hard to achieve especially in the long term. its so frustrating and everytime i bring it up they scream and say its too far and unsafe and stupid.

i know logically what im saying isnt crazy, but i start to feel bad overall but its like im literally an adult...

they then started saying im going to do what my sister did and leave the family and that this is just an excuse (like ok not like this makes me want to stay with yall😛) and when i told them they were being ridiculous they started saying that i have too much american influence... boy.

so AITA for wanting to study abroad and NOT take my MOTHE with me? 😍

Anyhow, last week my mother texted me asking if I could come by to get my birthday gift. I was alil confused as to why she couldn’t give it to me on my birthday as she was gonna see me anyway and I asked what was up. She said…”May not be able to lots of Dr appointments this month do you want to come here or not?” This made me annoyed but wasn’t surprising. I told her I was busy and couldn’t come til the weekend to which she said she was busy and that was a no go. 

I let it go. Haven’t even picked up my gift yet. She texted me today asking if I still got off work early on my birthday and if I wanted to go to lunch. I said no. She asked why and I simply said I made other plans. (I didn’t) and she responded with..”ok I guess”.

I’ve always been the person that’s way to kind and generous to others and I applied that same energy from the day I met my in-laws to the moment I decided to invite them to my babyshower, even after all the wrongs they have done to me. 
SIL has called me names, made post about me on fb, told me lies about my bf and his friends/ex girlfriends and even conspired to get my bf to cheat on me. She’s invited my bfs exs over knowing that he is coming over to her and his brothers house and has even went as far as getting his own mother and siblings involved in the affairs. I have been overly kind to her, tried to invited her to do things with me so we can at least try to be friends, and even bought her 300$ worth of baby/mommy items when she had her firstborn. I could really go on for DAYS about how much I’ve done for her and how little she treats me in return. 
Fast forward to today. I get a call from my bfs Stepmother who is planning my babyshower, and she tells me some woman called our venue from a blocked number and requested to cancel the whole event. The only reason the venue knew somthing was wrong was because the mystery caller used step mother’s married name instead of the name she used to book the date.  Friends and family were invited and none of them have ever had a problem with me except SIL and BIL. I didn’t invite my bfs mother or younger siblings because they have their own event planned for me and can’t get along with step mother long enough to be involved with the babyshower. The event is also private to anyone not invited. I have reason to believe SIL tried to cancel my babyshower out of complete hatred towards me or that she told her friend (one of the girls she tried to set my bf up with a few months ago) and they both conspired against me. 
The babyshower is still on, and booked under a complete different name that I don’t even know, but it is still a mystery who tried to cancel. I just know the facts and I’m worried someone will try to ruin my day again very soon, once they realize they failed at canceling the event.

>>>>>>> aaed1e67341ffdd97f5b4d6357238b5d09399ca9

   This all started back in September my husband went to a regular physician and they found a strange lump on his neck. 3 weeks since the first appointment my husband's lump got bigger so we had to go to the ER because he was having issues breathing. 6 hours in ER later he gets tests done and we get news that it's pushing on his Trachea and it is a lump on his Thyroid. Gets towards the end of the ER visit and the doctor was saying he was going to have to be admitted into a town 1 hour over, we panic and call close family and the news was upsetting for me but I calm down eventually. The ER doctor makes a few calls and a specialist says they will see husband tomorrow but due to some testing he can breathe and doesn't need to be admitted. ( this is important i promise.) 

  Enter with telling MIL: She is hysterical and insists on coming to hospital, we tell her that he is being discharged. Caledm her down  and she wants to go to appointment with specialist the next day and we all go to get diagnosis not a big deal.

We ended up getting Thyroid diagnosis and have a few appointments for husband. Get biopsies done ( due to inconclusive data). Eventually we come to a few days ago. My husband gets results from doctor and is told he has a malignant tumor with cancer cells so he needs it expedited. We have had surgeon consultation for him. He wanted it to just be me and him since his mom has been at every appointment and has been getting overwhelmed by her presence. 

  After talking it back and forth I am trying to make my husband as comfortable as possible. He has had a hard time with stuff physically and emotionally but has been keeping strong front for me. I don't communicate with his mom often because we have a negative history during this time that doesn't matter to me and we have been civil and get along.
  
After a talk this morning we had, I told his mom that it would just me and him for his surgery I would take him for the surgery just me and him. There would be overnight recovery and I would stay with him all night.
 
  She asked why she couldn't go, she was upset and got mad when I told her she couldn't go. 

   I get where she is coming from wanting to be there the day of the surgery but my husband has been juggling it back and forth having her there makes him stress.

 She brought up some past stuff that we still have issues. However I feel bad for making the situation worse on my husband because she blames me for not allowing her to go. I have communication with husband about his wishes since this is his surgery and he's the one dealing with this medical issues it's his choice if he wants to allow her. 

 I just want to know am I the asshole for telling her she can't go? I feel like isn't about me or her. It should be setting aside our issues and doing what's best for him. 

I just need to vent and would love input.

Best Friend and Sister say they hold no hard feelings toward Jake. I’ve started getting closer to him as a friend myself. We even made plans to cosplay together at an upcoming convention. After the breakup, he checked in with me about still doing it, and I told him I’d be interested since my friendship with him hasn’t changed.

For years, we’d all had a holiday gingerbread party hosted by Sister, with Jake and Sister’s friends in attendance. This year, since they broke up, Jake decided to host his own party, mainly inviting his own friends. He invited me but didn’t mention Best Friend, so I asked if he was planning to invite her. He told me I could tell her I was going, but didn’t indicate he’d invite her too.

When I told Best Friend, she was hurt. She’s always felt Jake excluded her, even when he was dating her sister. I suggested that maybe he felt uncomfortable inviting her because she’s close to his ex, but she pointed out that he’s invited other mutual friends close to her sister, so she doesn’t believe that’s the real reason.

We agreed that I would directly ask Jake if she could come, which I did, but he said he wasn’t ready to invite her yet. Best Friend was disappointed, saying that he just doesn’t want her there but isn’t willing to admit it. She asked me to think about it from a “moral” perspective, saying that if a mutual friend repeatedly excluded her, would I still go to their event?

While Best Friend told me she wouldn’t stop me from going, I can tell she’d feel hurt if I attended without her. I don’t want to dismiss her feelings, but I also value my friendship with Jake and want to go.

So, WIBTA if I went to Jake’s party anyway?

EDIT: reddit told me to use a fake name instead of a letter in place of the name, so i changed ""J"" to ""Jake"".

He was in a kinda tricky living situation, and told me he'd go to the social services the coming monday to get some accomodations. Monday never came, and all of a sudden i was living with my 10yo in my tiny room for half a year.

Everything started to smell. A rotten smell. Brother has some health conditions, so I figured that must have been the reason. And his skin sheds alot, so crumbles of skin were everywhere. We had to start wearing shoes inside. I was vaccuming at least twice a day. He did nothing. He was sitting behind the computer all night, yelling and swearing. Scraping his skin off and brushing it to the floor.

Everytime i cleaned the house it looked like shit within an hour. He never cleaned after himself. He kept taking food that was earmarked for kiddo's school lunches, so i had to hide the food in my bedroom closet. He took the food I was buying for my family.

He always asked to borrow money. He has more money than me and was living for free at my house. He's been borrowing money every other day from people.

He'd get into fits of anger by far right bull he was reading online. People stopped visiting, as they found it uncomfortable and disgusting to be near him. Ge started criticizing kiddo and my ability as a mother. Kiddo has ADHD. My brother chose to scream ""mongolid"" at him. A word I hate.

He kept going into rages about our mother, as she wasn't in a financial situation to keep lending him money. Calling her aweful things. When i tired of his tirades, I told him to give her some slack bc of her situation atm. He got angry and roared on.

He finally got an appartment, but had to wait to move as the previous renters had months left on their lease. I figured, how much worse can it get?

The place was a pigstye. It felt like a never ending cleaning job. I found out the smell was coming from his clothes, his body, used plates that was staling, and icecream boxes that he left there to rot for months. My mental and physical health was taking a toll, and at times I just wanted everything to end. If kiddo was gonna eat I had to skip meals some days. When I tried to say something about sleep and the food, he went off and kept going.

Moving day came. I was told someone would come and get his stuff, but they didn't come that day. The weather was bad, so I understood. But the next day I put his furniture in a tarp outside. I was told it was getting picked up. Had no room as kiddo's room had to be sterilized after my brother. Scrubbing the floors on our knees to get ingrown skins and dust off. Things were broken, and the room stunk. Every single little toy and crate, furniture, mattresses, curtains had to be cleaned. It took me and a cousin 48h. I let the stuff be. Didn't hear a word from him.

Now he's pissed off, saying I am ruining his furniture outside in fluctuating weather. Basically threatening me.
