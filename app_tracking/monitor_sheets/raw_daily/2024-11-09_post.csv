0,1gn7mqk,AITA for blowing up on my husband after our son came out as trans to him?,"
I'm using a throwaway because my husband has reddit.

Some backstory: I(39F) and my husband(43M) have been married for 17 years now and we've never had an argument this big. Our son (19M) has recently come out to me, as I work in a pediatric hospital with kids apart of the lgbtqia+ community. 

So, after my son came out to me with his new name(let's call him ethan), I asked if he had spoke to his father about it since he has an older mindset and isn't quite up to date with the new terms and labels. After ethan said no, I told him we could go out for a family dinner with us, his father and his sister(14F) to tell them about it. He agreed to this so I set up a date for the dinner.
On the day of the dinner, I had picked one of the fancy restaurants in the town and sat down with everyone.

Here is a rough transcript of what happened. E- ethan, M- me, A- andrew(my husband), G- Georgia(my daughter)

M-"" Listen everyone, I've decided to take us all out this evening for a special reason. Tonight is quite nerve racking for some people but with the right support, I believe we can help them.""

A-"" Don't tell me I've forgotten our anniversary.""

M-""No baby, it's something different. Would you care to take over, ethan?""

Andrew looked around confused until my son started talking.

E-""I just want to say thay I haven't been feeling comfortable in my own body recently. What I've done is some research on different sexual orientations and I figured out in trans. I no longer would like to go by *deadname*, and prefer that name ethan.""

G-"" Wow. Okay. Is there any chance you could explain things further? What made you think this?""

E-"" Just I dont really feel like my true self in certain items of clothing like dresses, skirts, skinny jeans, and that sort of thing. I've found out the term for what I'm feeling is dysphoria.""

A-"" Listen, *deadname*, I dont know what kind of  person put a spell on you but you're not ethan. you're *deadname* and always will be *deadname*. I can't believe this.""

After this interaction, my husband got up to leave but I dragged him back down into his seat and tried to explain things more clearly for him.

After he still wansnt getting what any of us were saying he left the restaurant and took the car home, leaving us stranded. Lucky for me, my sister lived nearby so I just asked her to pick us up and drop her off at her house. I left the kids there and took a taxi home, where I saw my husband in ethans room, taking out all of the 'masculine' clothes, as he called them, and taking some of Georgia's dresses and putting them in his wardrobe.

I confronted him and it lead to one of the biggest arguments we've has. At one point, he said the f slur which tilted me off the edge since he knew i was bisexual. It ended up with him leaving to his parents house and saying he doesn't know if he'll be back. I'm worried and don't know what to do now so can i get some help? I've told my kids to say at their aunties house for the night. AITA?",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-11-09,"AITA for blowing up on my husband after our son came out as trans to him?
