0,1goed3m,AITA for unintentionally hurting my roommate's feelings by focusing on my relationship and career?,"I (22M) live with my roommate (24M, bi), whom I’ve known for three years. He admitted he still has feelings for me and feels resentful. This isn’t the first time—he confessed two years ago, and I turned him down. Although our friendship initially strained, we rebuilt it, and this year decided to be roommates from September to May. Since then nothing hinting at his feelings came up. In Feb I started dating my girlfriend (21F), and he seemed supportive. I was in another state for an internship when I met her, so we’re now in a long-distance relationship.

The issues began two weeks ago when my girlfriend visited. On the first night, we were intimate, and he overheard us. The next night, he unexpectedly left for his hometown, canceling brunch plans with us. He said it was last minute to see a friend he hasn't seen in a long time. He ended up staying for over a week, which was unusual, especially since he had planned to drop me off at the airport. I figured he might be struggling (he recently quit a job he disliked and has been job hunting without success), so I supported his decision.

After I returned from a week-long conference, my roommate told me he’s questioning our friendship. He said his feelings for me resurfaced and hearing me with my girlfriend was difficult. He also mentioned that he feels we’ve drifted apart, saying I’ve changed and that all I do is focus on work. He expressed resentment over my new job offer, my fitness (I run and have lost weight), and my relationship, feeling that I make more time for my girlfriend than for him or our friends. He even said that if we met today, we wouldn’t be friends, adding that he’s always been there for me, yet I can’t do the same. He’s now set boundaries: my girlfriend can’t stay over, I can’t discuss her or my work around him, and we’re no longer sharing certain items like some utilities and food. If our friendship doesn't improve he'll move out (he would still pay his rent) and we will cut each other off.

For context, I’m now in a master’s program, working part-time, and interviewing for full-time roles despite already having an offer, as I’m concerned about the economy. I know I’m busy, and both my friends and girlfriend have suggested I find more balance. Despite my workload, I make time for him and others when I can, getting lunch or dinner. I am always working on something or working out.Even when my gf was visiting I spent most time with her still working, she is not clingy and never has demanded my attention away from my friends. She even would ask how my roommate is doing.The feelings issue never came up when I dated other people before my current girlfriend. We were never physically close, I never led him on, I made it clear I only saw him as a friend. I assumed his recent behavior was due to struggles with his job situation and mental health, not me. If I knew he still had feelings I would not have roomed with him.

1,1goe949,AITA for putting my sister and her boyfriend out of my house and would IBTA for keeping my nephew with me when that happened but getting ready to tell them they have to come get my nephew?,"
I (25F) put my sister (30F) and her boyfriend (39M) of 6/7 years out of my place. For context, Me and my fiance went through something this year and were not together for most of the year so I was. For over a year, l've been asking my sister to bring my nephew here so they could live with me. I asked that because they live in a really small town, so small that most of the people there we are kin to. I just wanted better opportunities for my sister and nephew and to show them that there's more than that small town. Her and her boyfriend showed up at my house at 3 AM randomly and said they were coming to stay with me for a little to find jobs before school started. Her boyfriend has 8 kids. She has 1 (my nephew). 

To be clear she showed up WITH her boyfriend and WITHOUT my nephew. She had left my nephew down in the small town with a friend of hers. It was summer time so he didn't have school.
Her boyfriend has custody of his 3 oldest children.
He left them down with his parents. To make it short, her boyfriend didn't find a job, she did. Her boyfriend would sit at my house all day and play games on his phone. He would leave full bags of trash in my dining room for a week and I would have to ask him to take them out(which I shouldn't have to even ask). He didn't clean up. He would go and buy something to smoke everyday. They weren't helping me with any bills. I would pay for their things and stuff because they helped me with my baby when he wasn't in daycare and I had to work. Th would use some of their foodstamps to put fool the house, that's it. 

Her boyfriend got into a wreck in my car and didn't even tell me before I let him
drive it that ha didn't have a anodlicenco Ha didn'tcall in a police report for the hit and run for that reason and they just kept going as if it didn't happen. So my car ended up being towed by the company that I was financing it through. I was using their car for a while. So I would put gas in it and I brought two new tires for it. They went and got my nephew when school started. Me and my fiance ended up getting back together. He came back to the house and he got into it with her boyfriend because the boyfriend had fried himself 4 porkchops and didn't give my nephew any or ask if he was hungry and told my nephew to warm up a pot pie out of the freezer. My fiance also offered for her boyfriend to come with him to get a job at a temp agency. He didn't go, he stayed home and played on his phone instead. 

I ended up getting evicted because of course i was paying bills with extra people in my house so l my bills became more. We moved into a new place and they didn’t help with fees. There dog would sit in a messed up cage all day while they were in bed. He and my fiance got into it again and I put them out. I did tell her how i felt and how i didn’t want him in my house but her and my nephew could stay. She didn’t relay that to him and kept him there. So i had to put her out with her boyfriend.

2,1goe4im,WIBTA for asking my roomate's friend to leave,"I (21 female) and my roomate (20) just moved in as randomly assigned roomate's this August. For the most part things have been fine and then she went MIA for a solid month. When she came back she didn't come alone and has had her friend with her for almost 3 weeks now. I'm not close with my roomate so I'm not sure how to approach the situation. While they haven't caused any major issued yet, it's still annoying coming home from work and having someone else in the house.

I'm just really weird about my space and who's in it, so for I guess no explicit reason it just makes me uncomfortable she's here all the time. And sometimes even here without my roomate.

When we moved in I had also asked my roomate to just send me a text letting me know if she was going to have anyone spending the night and I'd do the same so we wouldn't get jump scared by a random person in the apartment and she agreed. She did communicate with me her friend was going to be staying here but only the first two nights she was here and I haven't heard a word from her since.

I talked to the front desk and they said if she had been there for more than 4 days consecutively, and over 12 days in a calendar month that it was a breach of the lease and I could email them for them to deal with. I don't want any drama though and I don't want to be mean about it but I really want this other girl out of my space.

They also don't really clean, either of them, so when I go into the kitchen sometimes theres things crusted on the counter, they left a pot of rice and sausage out for over a week, and I feel like I'm the only one who actually cleans the floors.

They also are very loud and it's just the two of them. Our walls aren't very thick and I do my best to be respectful about it but I feel they don't do the same. I guess I sometimes may play music a little loudly but I try to do it when she isn't home and I told her when we moved in if I was ever being too loud to let me know and I'd turn it down and she's never said anything so I assume it hasn't been a problem on her end.

Also while this doesn't necessarily affect me personally in anyway, I will share out of annoyance. The friend smokes cigarettes and when I came home from a weekend trip there were cigarette butts in the water under our apartment (we live in a little house outside of the actual development over what is essentially a little pond), and the fact that she doesn't even live here and is going to litter is crazy. So i put out am old candle that I had been using for my own ashes and I told them they could use it too, after a couple dats I went back out there and the candle was almost full to the top with cigarettes and I had to empty it even though she was the only one contributing to the pile.

He later got a girlfriend and assured me from now on everything was platonic (never made any advances previously). When he was drunk he confessed, that nothing had changed and begged to kiss me, which I refused. Then the jealousy of his girlfriend led to him ghosting me. In the meantime I got a boyfriend and he broke up with her and now has a new girlfriend and a much more healthy relationship.

On a mutual friends birthday we reconnected and he initiated a conversation about wanting to get in contact again, how sorry he was and assured me how this was nothing like last time and he harbored no feelings for me anymore. I really missed him (platonically) but the problem is how jealous my boyfriend is of him.

He hates former best friend. In his mind his friendship never was and never will be platonic and the only thing he's after is having sex with me. That is why I refrain from mentioning him or even attempting to rebuild a friendship with him again. I would love to have him around like the way it used to be, but nor do I want to upset my boyfriend and neither do I want to give him false hope yet again. Of course everything I would tell or do with fbf I could and always will with my bf, but it's not the same. I just want my old friend back.


So would I be the asshole for reaching out to fbf and arranging a hang out, despite knowing my boyfriend will be afraid of something happening between us? Am I selfish for wanting him back as my bsf, even though I know there's a possibility of history repeating itself? I don't want to be a homewrecker.

5,1god61z,AITA for reporting my science group to my teacher?,"(English is not my native language, so forgive my bad grammar)
Yesterday I had a science fair in my school, lots of groups from all school made projects and displayed them for other students and their parents, but my group had some problems.

My group had five people, me, three boys (I'll call the principal ones G and M) and a girl, along the project of the fair I also had another project involving helping to build a small playground on school (the whole class was supposed to help, but just me and M helped to actually build it, the others only painted it after everything was done). During the building of our project for the fair a lot of problems happened, which was the project not working and half of the group doing nothing to help with it, only me and M built it (it was a mini thermoelectric industry), so in 4 hours we did something that could be done in 1, the rest only did a poster and a plaque to decorate the table. I obviously reported that to the teacher that was responsible for us, that made him send an audio in our groupchat about it, that made my group furious because ""that's just a division of tasks"" and how they had to take care of the playground too (all they did was make a painting on a wall which I had to finish too), I just ignored the texts and audios because I was busy trying to make the project work all by myself in my home (which sadly failed), but I still got mad because they kept sending things like ""I hope you all can respond"" all the time instead of talking to me directly about the issue (yes, they knew it was me).

In the day of the fair we had an argument about it, G was pissed because I reported what was happening to the teacher and kept asking of I wanted our project to be ugly and saying how he also was working on the playground, I replied saying that I also worked there and even more because he was not there to help when it was built, only me and M were, then he kept saying that it was something all class should do, so I replied that it has nothing to do with our project and it's their problem (I can explain it better in the replies if you don't understand what it means). The discussion ended with most of the group thinking I'm an asshole for complaining.

I thought this whole thing ended, but it just got worse, the teacher responsible for the playground project changed who was going to present it last minute without telling me (I was the one who would do that, but she put G in my place, and it was for nothing because ot rained that day). I stood in the same place for 3 HOURS presenting the project because my group was nowhere to be found (except, again, M), naturally I asked him to look for them, and guess what? They refused to come present ""our"" project, so I only had few minutes to see other projects. Luckily M told our teacher that when I was away.

But it all got me wondering if I'm really an asshole for that or just wanted some fair justice, mostly because after our fight G had a panick attack.

6,1goclap,AITA for not telling my friend I was going to a concert?,"A little over a month ago, my friend that I’ll call T (32F), and I (29F), went to a concert in Chicago and didn’t tell our friend, that I’ll call A (29F), and now she won’t talk to us.

 Back in June, T bought herself and I tickets to a concert in Sept. in Chicago for an artist that all three of us happen to like. T didn’t think to buy a ticket for A because she knows A doesn’t have the money to pay her back for a ticket or the travel, because A doesn’t work.

We knew A would be upset because not only were we going to see an artist she also likes, but she has talked about wanting to visit Chicago, but this artist wasn’t going to be visiting a closer city, so we didn’t really have a choice. A also experiences FOMO quite a lot and complains all the time that no one ever invites her to things, or she blows up at us when she finds out we did something without her. Even though we invite A to everything we do that is either free or is within her means.

Over the months we tried to figure out a way to break the news to A gently so that maybe she wouldn’t get angry and yell at us like she has in the past. Unfortunately, every time we planned to tell her, something would get in the way. Either our plans to see A would get canceled, or something emotionally distressing would happen in A’s life that made us feel bad about potentially upsetting her.

It started getting close to the concert and my people pleasing tendencies and anxiety had me in a chokehold over the situation. T kept talking about just ripping the bandage off and telling A through text but I’d start to panic at the idea of upsetting A so she never would go through with it. 

We ended up not saying anything, coming to the conclusion that we didn’t really need to “get permission” to do whatever we wanted with our time and money, but agreed that we would talk to A about everything after the concert.

Well, A found out we were in Chicago for the concert due to instagram stories that T had posted that I thought weren’t going to be posted until later after talking to A. She didn’t say anything, but we know A saw the stories. 

We weren’t able to reach out to A until the day after we got back home because our trip was a “get in, get out” type of visit just to see the concert and then leave.

So, I reached out first. I started by apologizing for not telling her about us going to the concert but that every time we had tried, something held us back and eventually I just became so anxious about potentially upsetting her that I froze up. But I didn’t feel the need to apologize for going to the concert because I’m not sorry for going. I told her that I understand if she was still mad at us but I hoped we could have a discussion about it.

A has not talked to us since then. I’ve had a few people tell me that I need to reach out and apologize again, but I really don’t want to do that as I feel like I left the ball in A’s court and she should be able to reach back out to us so we can talk about all of this.

7,1goci6a,AITA for not caring if my mother is allergic to cats?,"I (27F) have a mom (53F) who’s severely allergic to cats and has asthma, which cat dander makes worse. My husband (32M) and I moved across the country a few years ago—from the East Coast to the West Coast—and since then, we’ve built our little fur family with two dogs. Now, we’ve been wanting to add a cat to the mix for a while, and we’re financially stable and not allergic ourselves.

A couple of months ago, I mentioned this to my mom, and her response was, in a snarky tone, “Well, just know the rest of your family and I will never visit you, but if that’s what you want, then fine.” It stung a bit to hear that, but honestly, she’s only visited us once in the years since we moved. I feel like we should be able to make decisions about our own home without her allergies being a factor, especially since she rarely visits anyway.

8,1gocemb,AITA for cooking pizza,"So literally 10-15 min ago my mom blew up about the fact I’m selfish for only making food for myself, which to be clear, this time I wasn’t even making it for just myself. We had 2 store bought pizza doughs and would make 2 different pizzas. I wanted a Margherita and she wanted one with lots of onions, so I made the first one and to my fault me and my brother did eat the majority of it, cuz we were paying attention to the ongoing soccer match and kinda zoned out so I bear some fault there. She came in and flipped out that the pizza was nearly gone and went on the whole “you can’t cook unless you cook for all of us” tirade despite the fact I was about to start making the second pizza. I was, in fact, preparing all the food and doing the subsequent cleaning. 

She then complained and said she’s not even going to eat anymore and wants to go out with my dad despite an entire other pizza being mad(the one she wanted) but before that she kept complaining about how I prepare my meals at different times of the day (most of the time hours before anyone else is home) and how when she cooks she cooks for everyone so I should be doing the same thing despite the fact my mom cooks once a week MAYBE and is not home for 80% of the day due to being at work.

She now wants to assert I can’t cook at all unless it’s for everyone and this also means I can’t make anything even if it’s hours before anyone else is home. To give you an idea, say there is some ground beef in the fridge, by what she says I cannot portion half of the ground beef for my lunch or whatever and if I’m hungry she says to just eat snacks or whatever or wait until everyone is home and be expected to cook for everyone.

She also threatened to kick me out for this and was upset about feeling like we live as roommates. This is the way it is because she works all day for one but more importantly she was just an emotionally immature parent with control issues that thought providing the basic legal necessities were enough and once I stopped letting her get her way with me and letting her control my life by standing up to her and putting emotional distance between us she’s now upset of the consequences of her actions. Though she’ll likely never admit she did wrong and continue to think I’m some selfish pos and being unreasonable irdc at this point given the status of the nonexistent relationship we have emotionally speaking.

16,1go7vlg,WIBTAH if I told my mom that her dad might not be getting better?,"So, for context, my grandpa(68-69?) had an injury last year that gave him a concussion, which wasn’t treated correctly. This led to him having Vascular Dementia. 

It’s been awful for him the last year or so. He bought multiple cars and ended up bankrupting himself, which led to him losing all of the cars and his house, and was put in a nursing home that he used to work in(if he didn’t live a state over, he would be living with me and my mom).

He’s been having trouble doing basic things, holding conversations, etc. He can’t do much on his own anymore because he’ll forget what he’s doing halfway through.

Now, I know that there’s a thing where people with dementia can have a long period of lucidity before they start to get really bad, especially towards the end of life. My mom does not seem to know this, and this is what I think is going on.

So, WIBTAH?",Asshole,2024-11-10,"WIBTAH if I told my mom that her dad might not be getting better? So, for context, my grandpa(68-69?) had an injury last year that gave him a concussion, which wasn’t treated correctly. This led to him having Vascular Dementia. 

It’s been awful for him the last year or so. He bought multiple cars and ended up bankrupting himself, which led to him losing all of the cars and his house, and was put in a nursing home that he used to work in(if he didn’t live a state over, he would be living with me and my mom).

He’s been having trouble doing basic things, holding conversations, etc. He can’t do much on his own anymore because he’ll forget what he’s doing halfway through.

I (23F) invited a college friend (30F) to join my Halloween plans, and she asked if she could stay at my place for 1-2 days. I agreed, thinking it’d be a short visit.

Once she arrived, she was already tired and immediately needed help with errands—Halloween costume shopping, bottled water, etc.—even though I’d taken PTO to explore my new city. I tried to be a good host, but the two days turned into an unplanned week. She hinted she’d be working from my place all week, which I never agreed to, and treated my apartment like her own, even doing my laundry five times a day to ‘get rid of dust and wrinkles’ (something she never does at home).

After Halloween, she caught a cold, and I tried to take care of her while working from home, but she mostly ignored me, focused on her phone, and made plans with other friends in the area. She then suggested extending her stay even longer so we could go to the beach after a music festival we’d planned, but by that point, I was feeling so used that I wanted her to leave. I finally canceled the festival, saying my parents were visiting, which I thought would let her down easy.

When I told her, she got furious, accusing me of lying and insulting her. I tried to apologize and smooth things over since I was scared she knew where I lived, but she ended up leaving, sending me $300 for ‘rent,’ and then blocking me on social media.  The chain of fights could be a separate post itself.

All of us, including me, had an underlying condition that made the virus a death sentence, so beyond grocery stores, I really didn’t go anywhere. College was a time of great growth for me as I made a lot of self improvement from weight to friendships, and it all went 180 during the pandemic. I never saw my friends, I was putting on weight, and despite this dark time of my life, my family, my uncle specifically, had the nerve to tell me “I wasn’t worth 10 cents”. Everyone laughed it up like it was a joke, but with everything going on it cut right through me. 

Cut to 2022. I had just got back from a trip to Disney World, where out of nowhere, my aunt from another part of my state called me out of nowhere for $200. She has a gambling addiction and even told me to not tell anyone she was at the casino. I didn’t give her the money but I felt disrespected being seen as nothing but a piggy bank.

2023 saw minor instances of family not respecting my time, even when I already have plans. Going to the gym for your personal training session? No, gotta turn around even when you’re in the parking lot to get someone some gumbo. Having a happy hour with your coworkers you enjoy spending time with? No, gotta go leave early and pick up medicine which could wait till the next day. Wanna have a relaxing beach day? No, gotta be interrupted to buy someone a pizza with MY money and have it delivered to thier house. You see where this is going.

2024 has been a rough year. I got laid off in May and have yet to find work since.

Ten days after losing said job my mom told me I was a mistake and the only reason she didn’t abort me is because she was too far along in the pregnancy. She no joke told me this and that I was a selfish bastard because I forgot to put lettuce on a Chipotle bowl. I’ve let all of this stuff simmer inside me, as I’m the designated family peacekeeper and can’t get mad, but over the past couple of days something snapped in me. Maybe it’s the election, I don’t know, but I’ve been calling everyone out. I’ve told my aunt either she gets help for her gambling addiction or I’m cutting her out of my life.

19,1go7g86,WIBTA if I didn't mail my late family dog's ashes to my brother?,"Little bit of back story before we begin; I, 22F, had been taking care of the family dog for about 4 years, I want to make it known that I would've gone to the moon and back for her if it kept her alive a little longer. She had literally just turned 9 before she passed in July (her birth month).

Okay, back on track, my brother has never taken care of her at all since she was brought home. I mean never, didn't feed, give water, walk her, nothing. So I moved out of state a couple years back and took her with me, our mom was upset she couldn't keep her at the time, I was the best fit because of my job and what I could give her. During her final week I kept everybody up to date and informed about her health. It was really hard, she was/is literally my best friend and we did absolutely everything together. I took her for car rides, snuck her fast food sometimes. On her last day I made sure everybody that wanted to facetime with her or talk to her got to do so. He tried telling me I wasn't allowed in the room with her when she was euthanized, I shut him down, there was no way I was going to abandon her in her time of need. (This is important)

Fast forward, I receive her ashes in a beautiful box. I ask each family member what they would like to have in her memory, jewelry, her sqeaker toys, etc., I made a pocket on her little lamb chop toy for ashes. She has two lambs that she carried everywhere with her. An entire week of texts and calls go by, I finally had to have two other people ask him what he wanted before I got an answer. I made the lamb, added some love to it and asked where he wanted it sent. It's been days and again I had to reach out to two other people to even get an answer and it wasn't from him.

I understand he has to work and he is probably busy, but it feels like he just does not care whatsoever. It makes me so mad that I have to reach out to other people before I get an answer and it never comes from him. Would I be the asshole if I didn't send him any ashes until I heard from him directly or not send them at all?

  
UPDATE: So, five people had reached out to him after hearing about my attempts and he has continued to ignore them all. Apparently I should've known already per his words even though I just found out he moved a couple months ago. I still haven't heard from him directly either, just through one mutual friend and that friend couldn't even say because he refuses to speak about it. Talk about caring.

23,1go6cn9,AITA for not helping my mom that much with cooking after I already told her I don't really enjoy it?,"Hi, I (22f) live with both my parents (48f and 50m). Before I start, I would like to say that English is not my first language, and I’ll try to add as much detail as I can to the story, so I’m sorry if it turns out a bit long. I come from a ""traditional"" African household, meaning that us, women, are expected to do most of the chores and take care of the household.

I don’t really enjoy cooking, and I’m not very good at it. Growing up, when it was time for me to learn, my mom was always impatient and stressed, making the experience feel traumatic to the point where I started avoiding being in the kitchen with her. When I was around 14, my dad enrolled me in a cooking school because I asked, and I would come home excited to try new recipes. While some attempts didn’t go as expected, my dad was always supportive, encouraging me to keep trying and offering tips. My mom, on the other hand, would harshly criticize my cooking, saying I was wasting ingredients and using up her groceries just to make “bad” food.

Now, as you might imagine, I don’t really enjoy cooking, especially when my mom is around. I know how to cook and follow recipes, and while my food may not be chef-quality, it’s still tasty. During the weekdays, no one’s home due to work and college, so we have someone who cooks for us. On weekends, when we’re all home, I’m usually responsible for cooking both Saturday and Sunday. However, for the past weeks, I’ve been cooking less, as it’s a really stressful experience when she’s around. She interferes constantly, especially because of our different cooking styles and preferences. Everything has to be done exactly the way she insists, and I can’t even suggest doing things differently.

On top of that, my mental health has been challenging lately; I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety (both diagnosed), which makes it hard for me to engage in tasks—from getting out of bed to keeping my room organized, doing my hair, or feeling motivated to help around the house. My mom has noticed, but instead of talking to me, she yells and complains that I’m lazy, messy, don’t listen, and don’t take care of myself. She also says that if I don’t change, I won’t find a husband because I don’t cook , and that if I do, he’ll end up leaving me,  or that my house will be a mess, and my future kids won’t know how to cook because I won’t.

To avoid more stress, I’ve been staying out of the kitchen when we’re together to protect my well-being. I’ve even told her a couple times that I don’t enjoy cooking and only do it because I need to eat, explaining that I avoid cooking around her because of her attitude when I was growing up. She responded by calling me lazy. Since I came back, she’s been coming to my room after meals to complain that the food is bad, that I don’t put effort into it, and that I need to change. Is it wrong for a woman to dislike cooking? Am I wrong for not helping with cooking as much lately or avoiding it when she’s around?

Many years ago, when I was a few weeks shy of being 10, my sister ended up twisting her knee. For some reason I found this funny, and continually teased her about it. Eventually I stopped but I still made jokes about it from time to time until I was about 11.

Just a few days ago, I ended up twisting my knee. It was painful, and I was stuck on the floor of the house for a solid 10 minutes, not being able to do anything. I would have asked my mother to help me, but she was in the shower. So I call out for my sister, who walks up to me...and proceeds to laugh in my face. She just continually teases me until she goes back to her room, leaving me there unable to walk or move at all really.

Eventually I was able to get up, but only after about 30 minutes.

Am I still the asshole here?

EDIT: I am now 17, and she is 22. I know I was an asshole for teasing her, but that was seven years ago. She's in college by now and I apologised to her when I stopped.

26,1go5p9d,AITA for asking my sister to replace my jellybeans after her son ate them?,"
So, I (25M) recently invited my family over for dinner at my new condo. I’m really proud of this place—it took years of saving, hard work, and sacrifice to get here. It’s small, but it’s mine, and I wanted to celebrate with a nice family dinner.

I decided to make homemade spaghetti carbonara. I spent hours on it: crisped pancetta, freshly grated Parmesan, whisked with eggs and pasta water for a perfect, silky sauce. Carbonara is all about timing and texture, so I was in the kitchen paying close attention to every step. I added garlic bread, salad, and even made a cheesecake for dessert. It was a big effort, and I wanted the evening to feel special.

Now, I keep a big jar of jellybeans on my coffee table as a treat. I love picking out a few here and there, and I always save the Cream Soda ones for last—they’re my favorite. The jar has lasted a long time, and it’s something I enjoy after a long day.

My sister Laura (35F) brought her 7-year-old son, who’s honestly a bit of a handful. He’s not used to hearing “no” and thinks every space is his to do what he wants. My sister has never set limits with him, and growing up, our parents spoiled her too.

While I was busy in the kitchen, my nephew found the jellybean jar. I didn’t notice at first because I was trying to get the carbonara just right. After dinner, I went to grab a handful of jellybeans and realized that almost all the Cream Soda ones were gone. My nephew had picked them out, leaving a mess of crumbs and broken bits.

I pulled Laura aside and mentioned it, asking if she’d noticed. She just shrugged and said, “Oh, he only likes the Cream Soda ones, so he picked those out. No big deal.” I tried to be polite, but I told her that those were my favorites and asked if she could replace them, or at least get me some more of the Cream Soda flavor.

She got annoyed and snapped, “He’s just a kid. You’re seriously this worked up over some jellybeans?” I told her it wasn’t about the jellybeans, but that it would’ve been nice if she’d kept an eye on him or taught him to ask. Laura rolled her eyes and said, “Then don’t leave temptations out if you don’t want kids touching them.”

I asked her one more time to either replace the jar or just the Cream Soda ones, but she refused, calling me “petty” and saying I was blowing things out of proportion. My parents jumped in to back her up, telling me to “drop it” and that I should “know better than to have temptations out around kids.”

But it’s not just about the money—it’s about respect and boundaries. I put a lot into that dinner, and her response was to let her son treat my place like his personal candy store. Now my family thinks I’m overreacting, but to me, this is about respecting boundaries.

AITA for asking my sister to replace the Cream Soda jellybeans her son ate?

Edit:

I’ll accept my verdict since apparently it is normal these days to allow a child to root through a jar of jellybeans like a hog looking for truffles.

What I won’t accept, what I won’t tolerate, is the insults about my competency as a home chef.

Let me walk you through it, so you understand why real carbonara takes time and why cutting corners would be a disgrace.

First, I went to this authentic Italian market with shelves stacked high with imported goods, where the scent of cured meats fills the air. They carry real pancetta, flown in weekly, and I spent ages with the owner, Domenico, who handpicked the perfect wedge of Parmigiano-Reggiano for me—a rich, nutty block that was almost too beautiful to grate.

Next, I stopped at this tiny, family-owned shop that specializes in fresh farm eggs and produce. Carla, the owner, gets these eggs from a nearby farm, and each one is an intense, deep golden color, perfect for a creamy, rich sauce. 

Finally, I swung by a Salumeria for semolina flour. It sounds dramatic, but that’s the lengths I go for traditional pasta. The place feels like a rustic old-world bakery, with walls lined in wooden shelves and burlap sacks stacked high. Their semolina flour has a texture and richness that just doesn’t compare—ideal for handmade pasta that holds up with the perfect al dente bite.

Back home, I crafted the pasta from scratch. Flour piled on the counter, eggs nestled into a well, kneading it with care until the dough was soft and elastic, a process that took a solid 15 minutes of arm work. Then, I let the dough rest before rolling it into long ribbons, each one dusted lightly with flour, like fresh snow.

Finally, I crisped the pancetta, grated the cheese by hand, and whisked the eggs to the perfect consistency. The sauce had to be watched like a hawk—just enough heat to turn it creamy without scrambling, with careful additions of pasta water to reach that glossy, silken texture.

So yes, it took hours. And I’m not ashamed to say that.",Asshole,2024-11-10,"AITA for asking my sister to replace my jellybeans after her son ate them?

27,1go5owy,"AITA for referring to my aunt as ""my uncle's wife""?","I (22F) moved to the big city for school and my dad made arrangements for me to stay with my aunt and uncle for the first year because we're tight on money after my mom passed away. Everything was okay in the beginning and we all got along great. Total house head ended up being 5: aunt (34), uncle (45), me (22), cousin(F21) and youngest cousin (6) their child.

The problems came up when I would not cook dinner on certain nights but instead my cousin would. This was because I had late classes on Mondays so my cousin and I switched she would cook on Mondays and I would cook on Tuesdays. Or she would find something in the fridge like a broken egg and be on our cases. She calls me out of name, ask me who raised me, wouldn't even talk to me if I spoke to her and tells me I'm a nobody and that I am in no way special.

There was a time she went to the neighbours house and before she left she told me to give their daughter a bath and so I did. When I was done, I realised that I didn't bring along her towel so I looked for it but I couldn't find. So I went over next door to ask if she'd seen the towel. She literally told me to leave without helping so I left. I used the little ones washcloth to dry her off and we finished the night time routine and went to bed. The next morning she was so angry and asked why I went to go ask for a towel while she was busy with the neighbour. It looked like I was eavesdropping and that she was so disgusted with me and that she regrets bringing me in her home because it's like getting close to a snake that's poised and ready to strike. She asked why I didn't use my towel and I said it's because I don't like sharing towels with anyone and mind you this child has eczema.

She called my dad and he called me and he assured me that he didn't believe a word she said and he will talk to my uncle. She is only my ant through marriage. 

Last week we had visitors and she introduced me as ""this is my husband's niece"". Okay I saw that she was distancing herself from because she would introduce me her niece usually. 

My friend came over today but we were outside and she found us by the gate and she asked why we don't go sit in the house and I told her it's because her dad will be here in a few minutes so we'll just wait. My friend looks at me and asks to be introduced so I introduce my friend as such and her as my uncle's wife. After that her dad pulls up and they drive off so my aunt and I go in the house and she asks why I introduced her like that and I told her, ""You are his wife, are you not?"" 

She then goes on about how I don't appreciate her and how I was to compete with her in her own house.

I'm just happy that I'm finishing with exams in two weeks so I can leave and when I come back next year, I will be living on campus.

28,1go4we3,AITA for not throwing something out?,"I (30) was clearing my old things from our family house. I had this airsoft pistol that i was going to throw out, but my gf (28yrs old) decided agaisnt throwing it out and she wanted to bring it to her place and just play with it etc. it doest work it needs gas to operate. 

Today shes moving to a new apartment and her parents found the airsoft pistol in one of the boxes. it is metal build so can be mistaken for the real thing. 

anyways gf called me on the phone really angry saying her parents found the airsoft pistol and I should take resposiblity for it being at her place and her parents doesnt want me round anymore, theyve called me and shouted abuse, (they've never liked me) i didnt even get to explain or have a word in and they just hanged up.

I explained to my gf that she might have forgotten but it was her who wanted to bring it to her place, and she kept saying ""it doesnt matter you need to take resposibility because its yours""

Im not gonna fight this one because I think they've already won made their minds decided and how my gf reacted and handled the situation was poor.  This is not the first time something like this happened, there were occasions where I would stand up for her against her parents but my gf would still take their side of the arguement. 

she (gf) rely too much on her parents, they even make decisions for her at 29. 

I think Im done with them all tbh. 

(just fyi this is in the UK and we've been together for 2 and a half bumpy years)
