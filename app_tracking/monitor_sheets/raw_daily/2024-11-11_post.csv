0,1gp74wq,AITA for Not Letting My Brother Stay at My House?,"I'm a 23-year-old single mom going through a divorce, and as you can imagine, it's been a really stressful time. I haven't shared much about the divorce with my family because they didn’t support my decision to leave, thinking I was foolish for walking away from a financially stable marriage. But honestly, there was more to it than just money, and I made the choice for my well-being and my child’s.

Now, my older brother (28M) has been struggling with alcohol for a while. Every time he drinks, things spiral out of control. He’s lost several jobs because he often won’t show up after a night of drinking, and whenever he has money, it goes straight to alcohol. Sadly, he also ends up in bar fights or other reckless situations. Over the past few years, we’ve had to cover damages, hospital bills, and even bribe officials to get him out of trouble, all without him facing much consequence. When I try to talk to him about it, he brushes me off, saying I’m too young to understand the stress he’s under. My family usually takes his side, saying I’m being too pushy and that I should let him deal with things his way.

Recently, he got into another fight, and my sister called me, saying he’d been reported to the police because the other person was injured and pressed charges. They wanted me to let him stay at my house so he could lay low for a while. I couldn’t believe it!! they were expecting me to open my home, with my young son and everything else I’m handling right now!! When I told them that I just couldn’t do it, my mom said I was heartless, that I’d rather see him rot in jail than offer help.

I tried to explain that, with my son, my work, and the emotional toll of the divorce, I have too much going on to take responsibility for him too. I truly believe my brother needs to face the consequences of his actions, not just keep relying on us to bail him out. I told my mom that he’s a grown man, and if I’m ""too young to understand,"" then maybe it’s time the ""adults"" handle it. She didn’t take that well, and now my family is angry with me.

So, AITA for not letting my brother stay with me, knowing it might mean he faces some real consequences for his behavior? 

I'll keep y'all updated on whether he ends up in jail coz he is lucky I didn't call the police myself.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-11,"AITA for Not Letting My Brother Stay at My House?

1,1gp72de,AITA for refusing to let my boyfriend take a photo of me?,"Am I the asshole for refusing to let me boyfriend take a photo of me? For context… today is a stat holiday so my boyfriend and I, (33M and 28F) decide to go hike a trail together. A few minutes into the trail, I pulled my phone out to take a photo because the sun was peaking through the forestscape in a very photogenic way. My boyfriend, who very very rarely attempts to or offers to take photos of me, asks if I want a photo. I gratefully accept and walk 10 feet up the trail and turn to face him, he laughs and goes “aww a good one” and turns around my phone to show he had 10X zoomed in on my front lower torso. I gave him a choked out “ha ha very funny” as he insists he’ll take a serious one. I turn back around and walk 10 feet again and turn around, smile, pause. He paces towards me and goes “another good one” and turns the phone to show me another zoomed in photo of my crotch.

At this point, my patience for this “joke” has very much passed but he won’t hand me my phone and insists he will take a serious one but as I turn to walk away I see him zooming in again so I try to pull my jacket over my backside (I’m wearing leggings) because I feel that that’ll be the next victim of the 10X zoom. As I walk away he tries to show me the hilarious zoomed in photo of me trying to pull my jacket over myself. I begin to walk away again after putting out my hand so he can give me my phone, he refuses and insists that he’s going to do a serious one, I say “no thanks” and start to walk away which is when he begins verbally berating me for trying to ruin a fun time and that he’s “just being goofy.” 

For nearly the first 45 minutes of the trail we didn’t speak and then when we finally did we never discussed it.

Am I overreacting, am I enabling him by laughing the first time? I’m aware he is into immature humour (he consumes a lot of Kill Tony etc) and I try not to be judgemental but that type of humour just isn’t personally for me. Also, later in the hike he offered to take more photos of me but I declined (I hold a grudge, bite me).

Last weekend we got into a unrelated heated argument about how a “joke” he made upset me and while trying to explain why it was upsetting, he cut me off and in an aggressive tone, suggested I post an Am I The A**hole to resolve the matter…. so help me out folks…

2,1gp6pd7,AITA for telling my close friend that my parents were “unenthusiastic and unsupportive” of my recent job opportunity?,"Hi there! A few weeks ago during school I applied to different job applications online because I was bored. I'm 15 F, and haven't really done anything with extracurriculars before. I have plenty of spare time apart from school which made me want to get a job for some spending money. I end up hearing back from one job and I schedule an interview, I then tell my parents and they're fine with it and take me to it the next day. It goes really well, with my interviewer telling me at the end that I should, ""Go home and think about it, and if you want to work here let me know and I could get you started next Tuesday."" Of course I was so happy about this and after the interview rushed out to tell my parents. I was very happy talking about it but wavered after a while because of their reactions. It was like they didn't even have one, yk? When I brought this up my mother brushed it off and told me to continue talking, so I did. And still no reaction. I had been keeping my childhood friend of 7 years informed about it so he texted me right after the interview. I told him it went well, he congratulated me, and we talked a bit before he asked about my parents reaction. I texted back saying, ""very unenthusiastic and unsupportive"". My mother was looking over my shoulder reading when I sent him this and immediately gasped. Surprised that I had told him that. She told my father and he proceeded to get mad. I explained my side of it to my mother saying that I was really disappointed because they're usually very congratulatory about things like this. And I thought they would be so happy that I nailed my very first job interview. She then accepted it hearing my side and I went over to explain the same to my dad. My father tends to retract away from others and then explode when angry and he was doing the same thing now. We were in public so I kept my voice low and calm, refusing to be swept away in an argument like my mother and father frequently do. After a very long time he just went completely quiet and wasn't talking to me, I guess because I wasn't letting myself get angry and giving him the reaction he wanted. The next day he avoided me, and he kept ignoring me for a while before going back to acting like nothing had happened. I believe that entire argument happened only because my mother and father didn't want someone outside the family to see us as imperfect. My father has been a lead pastor at our church for 10 years, this is the same church that my childhood friend goes to, and his dad is the youth pastor at pur church. I sort of grew up with the ""your the pastors daughter. You must act like it."" type thing, even when he wasn't a pastor he still had a position in the church. I've grown up always fake smiling to church members, exchanging fake pleasantries and just being the perfect daughter. (My childhood friend actually busted out laughing at me once when my smile instantly dropped and my rbf returned after a church member who was talking to me finally left). I say all this just to show my reasoning behind why that argument happened, not because they were upset I saw them that way, but mad that someone else would see them that way. Someone else that was important in our church. This is now my 6th week working at my job and the only person who has congratulated me on it has been my childhood friend.

4,1gp68yl,AITA for wanting my coffee maker turned off when not in use?,"i (23m) have a coffee maker. it's a little old, but works fine. the only thing is that the ""auto off"" feature no longer works. it would, as expected, turn off after making a cup. i used to use it, but eventually it just stopped working. don't know why. after a couple months of it not working, i just turned the feature off.

i don't mind if anyone else uses my coffee maker (why would i?), i usually just ask new people to please turn it off when they're done.

my family however seem to have an issue? i *have* explained more than once that it *does not work,* i have even *demonstrated* to my parents that it will stay on. but every time i am met with the *same* answer- ""there's an auto off feature, just turn it on"". i then re-tell them it stopped working so i turned it off. then the conversation either turns cyclical, or they just get sort of...weird, shut down or completely change the subject? it's largely my parents, though others do it too. i have ***never*** raised my voice or been aggressive about it. it's a fucking *coffee maker,* i *know* it's not that big of a deal.

...but it makes me feel like i'm fucking crazy. the way that the conversation goes the same way *every* time. the fact that both of my parents have *seen* it not shut off when the feature is *visibly turned on*. but it always just goes back to them pretending i never said anything *immediately.* this is not a new thing- it has been an occasional happening for *years.* it's not every day, but i've noticed it happening a bit more frequently as of late. i almost feel like i'm being fucking gaslit.

i know there will be one question asked- there's 2 reasons i would like it turned off:

\- it's not good for electronics to be left on all the time. my dad in particular *knows* this- he built *computers* for a living and has worked with technology his entire life.

*-* a relevant quirk of our house is that small kitchen appliances cannot be used at the same time or it blows a fuse- microwave, coffee maker, etc. on their own? fine, but for example you can't run a kettle and coffee maker simultaneously. it's the heat that causes it. so a coffee maker that's *constantly* on, heating water, is gonna cause an issue sooner or later.

here's why i might be TA:

\- i *know* it's a super small thing. my coffee maker will not explode and stop working if it's left on for a bit. i just want to preserve it as best i can. but i might be making a mountain out of a molehill and should just shut up and turn it off without saying a word.

\- i know it's hitting personal wounds. i've been infantilized, treated like i don't know anything, like i'm stupid, irrational, and unreasonable by an overwhelming majority of people in my life. not my sisters- i'm really close to them, and i feel like they're the only ones that *get* me. but parents, other family members, ex friends/partners, even teachers and school staff. feeling not listened to is hitting sensitive nerves, and i know that might be why i feel like this.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-11,"AITA for wanting my coffee maker turned off when not in use? i (23m) have a coffee maker. it's a little old, but works fine. the only thing is that the ""auto off"" feature no longer works. it would, as expected, turn off after making a cup. i used to use it, but eventually it just stopped working. don't know why. after a couple months of it not working, i just turned the feature off.

5,1gp62ys,AITA for not obeying my mother (47F) when she wants me (19M) to wear certain clothes outside due to the temperature?,"Hello. My mother and I have had numerous disagreements, and one that pops up quite frequently has to do with her not wanting me to wear too little clothing according to what season it is. An example of this is how, today, I walked to my uni (30 min away) wearing shorts and a coat. When I came back, it was around 9 degrees celsius outside. 
For context, I often wear less clothes than what I assumed most people think is appropriate for the current temperature and season, with me easily feeling too warm. I also feel more comfortable in shorts than in pants.
She was surprised when she saw me arrive home wearing cargo shorts. A bit later, she got mad at me for this, saying that she doesn't want me to look weird, that me looking weird for this and not caring could harm my future employment, that ""are you seeing anyone dress like this?"", and that, considering that it is autumn, I should dress appropriately ""for this time of year"" and ""for this temperature"" to not get bad looks from other people. She said she wondered if she has to take away my shorts so that I don't do this anymore. We had a 'shouting match' because of this, neither of us conceding.

7,1gp5241,WIBTA: If I don't use my new keypad in my raid group tonight?,"Hello,

I have been gaming on a Logitech G13 for just about every game I use, including World of Warcraft. I love that thing to death, but it has an issue that occurs every so often - once in a rare while, if I'm pushing the keys too fast, the device won't accept any key inputs until I double tap the ctrl keys on my regular keyboard, whereupon it works like normal. Most of the time, this isn't an issue, but I'm one of my guild's main tanks this tier. While we were doing a side activity as a guild (M+, for those in the know) I mentioned this bug off-hand, and my guild leader told me that I should get that fixed or replaced. I told him I would replace it if I could, but 1) I was unemployed at the time (though I was getting ready to start a new job soon), 2) the G13 is like 500 bucks second-hand, and 3) the G13 was discontinued years ago, with no good replacement. My guild leader decided to fix all three by just getting a Razer Tartarus and having it mailed to me (seriously, stand-up move from him, holy crud) and I got it in the mail yesterday. Hooray, I thought! I can get this set up in time for raid tonight! Now I DEFINITELY won't get the rare bug!

Now for the WIBTA. This thing is TINY. The G13 was big enough to accommodate my hands and be able to push every button comfortably, but I can't do that on the Tartarus. Either my big gorilla mitts take up too much of the keypad and I can only push a handful of buttons, or I can reach every button and my hand is cramping within 5 minutes. Even if I can reach every button, my muscle memory means I'm fatfingering every other key press I touch. I took it to a low level key with some other guild members, and I wanted to punt the damn thing by the end of the run.

I just want to switch back to my old keypad, but there are a few things keeping me from doing so. 1) My guild leader did get this for me, which, again, really appreciate him for doing that, I want to be totally crystal clear here. 2). The aforementioned bug, which isn't often an issue (most nights, it doesn't even occur) but it can sometimes crop up. I feel a little guilty about wanting to just. Use the old keypad for a while, but if I have to use the new one for raid tonight, I'm gonna have to extract it from a wall at this rate. Help?

EDIT: I sent a message to my guild leader to the effect of ""Hey, I've been really struggling to get used to this new keypad, I'm going to use the old one for our raids, but I'll keep experimenting with the new one to see if I can figure out a way to use it without killing every tendon in my hand"".

I told him I would replace it if I could, but 1) I was unemployed at the time (though I was getting ready to start a new job soon), 2) the G13 is like 500 bucks second-hand, and 3) the G13 was discontinued years ago, with no good replacement. My guild leader decided to fix all three by just getting a Razer Tartarus and having it mailed to me (seriously, stand-up move from him, holy crud) and I got it in the mail yesterday. Hooray, I thought! I can get this set up in time for raid tonight! Now I DEFINITELY won't get the rare bug!

Now for the WIBTA. This thing is TINY. The G13 was big enough to accommodate my hands and be able to push every button comfortably, but I can't do that on the Tartarus. Either my big gorilla mitts take up too much of the keypad and I can only push a handful of buttons, or I can reach every button and my hand is cramping within 5 minutes. Even if I can reach every button, my muscle memory means I'm fatfingering every other key press I touch. I took it to a low level key with some other guild members, and I wanted to punt the damn thing by the end of the run.

I just want to switch back to my old keypad, but there are a few things keeping me from doing so. 1) My guild leader did get this for me, which, again, really appreciate him for doing that, I want to be totally crystal clear here. 2). The aforementioned bug, which isn't often an issue (most nights, it doesn't even occur) but it can sometimes crop up. I feel a little guilty about wanting to just. Use the old keypad for a while, but if I have to use the new one for raid tonight, I'm gonna have to extract it from a wall at this rate. Help?

EDIT: I sent a message to my guild leader to the effect of ""Hey, I've been really struggling to get used to this new keypad, I'm going to use the old one for our raids, but I'll keep experimenting with the new one to see if I can figure out a way to use it without killing every tendon in my hand"".

8,1gp347g,AITA for jokingly telling my friend i don’t like her?,"I (F14 at the time) had a friend called L (F15 at the time). We had been friends for a few years, and during those years we had bantered a lot. We are british, and it is normal for friendships to banter. 

It all started when she did something, i can’t remember what as it was a few years ago and i said in a joking way, “I can’t believe this, I hate you!” and she replied back “Well I hate you.” or something along those lines, (this was normal as we had said this multiple times before, and if she had said she was uncomfortable i would have stopped). L acted normal and we went on about our day.

Weeks later, at lunch some younger years started screeching like a moneky, and so i said “omg is there a monkey”, and I was looking at L when I said that. A separate incident, I was asking her about her religion as she had said she was a buddhist, and so I asked her what was the difference between that religion and hinduism as i was young naive and in a predominantly white, christian area and so uneducated. She shrugged me off and I said i was sorry as I thought i offended her.

L then sent a text to the friend groupchat, accusing me of being racist towards her, reffering to the monkey incident (she is white), and to me disrespecting her religion. She also said that I was bullying one of her friends who I have never spoken to in my like, and she also said that i was spreading rumors about her and that i hated her. I was confused, and my friends took her side.

I was walking home from school the next day and these two older girls (16 or 17?) cornered me and started shouting at me about slagging off L. Me being a sensitive 14 year old, i start crying at run off. Near to my home, another girl corners me (17) and says the same thing. I felt unsafe, i knew these girls were best friends with L and had a history of fights and so once again i ran off. 

L started talking shit about me to everyone, and so I am now in a new friend group. She never confronted me personally, and so i have never gotten clarity if I am in the wrong? I might ask some of my friends from back then, as I know that they arent friends with L anymore. AITA? 

UPDATE: i asked around with Ls personal friends, and she is now christian— apparently she just says it was a phase. im not sure how true this is but i did ask some of our mutual friends and they all told me the same thing. as for the entire situation, apparently she had been shit talking me years before this even happened. this is probably all petty drama, but it really did a number on my highschool years.",Everyone Sucks,2024-11-11,"AITA for jokingly telling my friend i don’t like her?

9,1gp31jc,AITA for Refusing to Cover My Friend's Rent After She’s Been Paying for Our Roommate’s Share for 2 Months?,"Alright, here’s the deal: I (22F) have been living with my best friend (23F) and two other roommates for about a year now. Everything started out fine, but it’s all gotten a bit messy lately. 

One of our roommates (24M) lost his job about two months ago. He’s still been looking for work, but he’s been getting by by asking my best friend to cover his portion of the rent and utilities. She has a full-time job and could technically afford to do this for a while, but she’s still been asking me and the other roommate to help with our share of things too, as she can’t pay the full rent on her own.

 I totally get that people go through tough times, and I get that he’s trying to find work—but here’s where it starts to feel off: He’s not really doing enough to help himself. He’s been taking casual gigs here and there, but it’s not like he’s putting in the kind of effort needed to really get a stable job. He’s been living off the generosity of my best friend, and honestly, it’s starting to feel like she’s enabling him rather than him actually trying to get his life together.

 I've talked to her about it, and she says it’s not a big deal because he’s her friend, and she doesn’t mind helping him out. But I told her that I’m not comfortable with her paying for someone’s rent who isn’t making enough of an effort to help themselves. I also told her that I can’t keep carrying the extra weight if things don’t change, because I’m already struggling to make ends meet, too.

 Last night, I told her that I’m done contributing to this situation. If he doesn’t start pitching in for rent soon, then I think he should move out. It’s not my responsibility to pick up the slack just because he’s a ‘friend’ of hers, especially if he’s not taking steps to improve his situation. I told her that I can’t help her cover for someone who isn’t showing any signs of working toward a solution.

 She was devastated. She said I was being cold-hearted and that I was being selfish. She told me I’m acting like I don’t care about him and that true friends support each other, even when it’s hard. Now, some of our mutual friends are backing her up, saying that I’m being too harsh and that I’m not being a good friend by not helping out.

 I’m really torn because I want to support my best friend, but I also don’t think it’s my responsibility to keep this going. Am I being unreasonable?

11,1gp2klx,"WIBTA If I start asking my financially struggling friend for ""gas"" money to drive her around in my EV?","Hello, I have recently connected with a old friend I haven't talked to in about 10 years. She lives in a town 30 minutes away, while I live in the city. I found out she doesn't have a car, nor her license or permit, so I have to drive us to places. Most times I just drive 30 minutes to and from her place, to my place to hang out, since that is a free option.  But it has gotten to a point where I may have to put down boundaries, as I'm getting tired taking a minimum 2 hours of my time just driving around for us to hang out. (1 hour to and from her place, 1 hour from to my place.)

But I drive an electric car, so technically im not using gas, so I feel like asking for ""gas"" money in this sense would be wrong, but I am still paying for ""fuel"" regardless. 

The other day we were talking on the phone, and while talking about what we were doing next, she told me that ""When I need to go grocery shopping, Ill just call you, because you have a car!"" Which irked me, but as long as its on a day we planned to hang out, its whatever.  THEN she asked ""When are you going to pick up more weed? You could drive us to x state for us to pick up weed"" Which is a 3 hour drive one way from my place. It was my mistake to give her some of my stash, now she wants some of her own.

I got irritated when she asked, but I just told her ""It may be a while, I have to budget this month"" Which eventually lead to ""my boyfriend can come too and pick stuff out!"" And at this point, I feel like I should ask for gas money for a road trip, ESPECIALLY with another tagging along, on this 3 hour road trip when supercharging.  But she doesn't have much money, she has been calling me telling me she has no money for groceries, bills, or rent. So it feeds into me feeling like an asshole if I asked her for ""gas"" money.

So, Would I Be The Asshole If I asked my low income/poor friend for ""gas"" money, to drive her around, despite her spending money on things she shouldn't be spending it on?

12,1gp2f6m,AITA for hating my fiancés cat,"My fiancée (28m) who i’ve been with for 2 and a half years has this cat whom he LOVES. he found the cat right after his dad died when he was 18 and they have been homeless together, traveled across country together, been through a lot together. he had this cat when he didn’t have anything else, he says he’s his “soul cat”. Since then he had bought a house, got another cat, and adopted a dog. when i eventually moved in with him i brought my dog, so together we have two dogs and two cats. 
Now, my dog is trained and behaved, he begs a lot but that’s just because i’ve spoiled him over the years. My fiancés dog, however, is not trained, not behaved, and pees and poops in the house and tears into the garbage and just makes a mess. we had to get completely new carpet through the whole house because of her. I’ve put up with it because I am an animal lover and i’d rather put the work into re-training her than just rehome her (she’s 10 btw). Since getting a crate and crate training her it’s been much better. 

However, after 2 years of putting up with that, his cat is driving me insane. He doesn’t shut up, like i grew up with cats but NOTHING compares to how much this cat meows. I’m a sucker for a cute little meow but he’s going off ALL THE TIME, wakes us up in the middle of the nigh which has been horrible since having our son 3 months ago, so when we’re not being woken up by a crying baby, we’re being woken up by a cat that wants food. He recently got into our pantry and pooped in it, everywhere. He peed on our bathroom floor twice which he has never done before. he threw up on the carpet and ruined it, the NEW carpet that went on my credit that i’ve been paying off the 1000’s of dollars. He gets into our food and eats it off the counters even tho we’ve trained him to stay off the counters (i know we have bc he only goes up there when no one is around now, so he knows he’s not supposed to). We’ve even taken him to the vet because of the peeing outside his litter box and throwing up but no, nothings wrong. 

Like i said, i grew up with cats. I’m an animal lover. but this cat has really been annoying me. Since my fiance has such a connection with the cat, it’s made him sad that i’m so annoyed by him, he annoys my fiance too, but not to the same extent.

First of all the context. I (23F) am currently working through a masters program to become a licensed counselor. My grandmother has always been a touchy subject for me. She has always had favorites, my uncle over my dad, and has never really liked my mother because my mother doesn’t take anyone’s crap. 

Some instances when I was 3 I asked her to come spend Easter with my parents and I (we’ve always lived in another state but they do visit often) in this instance she told me “I can’t I’m going to spend it with my grandchildren” firstly ouch but this was only the start. She regularly compares me to my cousins when I got all A’s I was compared to my cousin who got A’s and B’s. She’s compared me to a niece who’s also a therapist and told me we could discuss it. (She’s a physical therapist. I’m doing mental health work). And never wants to go do anything with me when they come down and even tried to get out of going to my 21st birthday dinner and did not interact with me at my bachelors graduation party. There’s so much more but I can’t go into all that now. 

The recent thing is she’s been helping out her siblings who have gotten older. But she goes to all their appointments and drives them everywhere only to complain about it to everyone else saying it’s so hard and she doesn’t want to. 
Side note: they have a family friend who has offered to take them for just gas money in return. 
When she’s confronted with this fact she says that’s what you do for family even though when someone has a difference in opinion than her and stands their ground she cuts them off. I.e. my cousin whom she hasn’t spoke to in about three years. 

On to the issue. My grandparents visit for three months every year and live in the house with me and my parents (it’s a lot). She complains about problems she makes for herself. The thing is I’ve learned ways to confront people in a way that’s polite, nonjudgmental and opens people up to their own contradictions through school. I’m starting to think that maybe talking to her this way will at least ease some of the conflict. 

To be clear I have considered cutting contact however that would be hard on my dad and I would no longer be able to see my grandfather who has always been amazing to me. My grandmother is vindictive and does not like being stood up to and will refuse to contact me like she has my cousin. I live states away and my cousin in an hour WITH the first great grandkid and they still do not see her. 

TL:DR: my grandmother drives us crazy and I’ve started to consider talking to her like I would a client in therapy so that maybe the tension and aggression goes away.

On to the issue. My grandparents visit for three months every year and live in the house with me and my parents (it’s a lot). She complains about problems she makes for herself. The thing is I’ve learned ways to confront people in a way that’s polite, nonjudgmental and opens people up to their own contradictions through school. I’m starting to think that maybe talking to her this way will at least ease some of the conflict. 

To be clear I have considered cutting contact however that would be hard on my dad and I would no longer be able to see my grandfather who has always been amazing to me. My grandmother is vindictive and does not like being stood up to and will refuse to contact me like she has my cousin. I live states away and my cousin in an hour WITH the first great grandkid and they still do not see her. 

TL:DR: my grandmother drives us crazy and I’ve started to consider talking to her like I would a client in therapy so that maybe the tension and aggression goes away. ",4.0,-0.000746432,0,0

16,1gp0bxs,WIBTA if I don’t go to my boyfriend’s family home for Christmas?,"I (28F) am not close with my parents (long story short, they’re not exactly good people), but I’m always cordial with them and have always come home for Christmas. 


Last year, I invited my boyfriend (28M) to come if he wanted (after asking my parents—they were fine with it), and he came and we had a good time. 


This year, he’s inviting me to come to his parents’ house for Christmas. I like his parents, but I must admit I don’t really want to go because (this may be shallow) I don’t think it will be as fun. My parents, for all their flaws, like to have a good time—there’s always lots of alcohol, great food, and general festivity at their house over the holidays. Even more importantly, Christmas week has always been a time for me and my sister (who live in different cities) to hang out and have fun. 


My boyfriend’s parents don’t drink, they don’t do anything special for holiday meals, and they live in a suburb far from fun activities. His sister and her husband have a just-turned-one-year-old, so the chances that we’re going to be able to go out and have fun with them are somewhat slim. More than anything, I’ll miss my sister. However, if she goes back to her city for New Year’s Eve, I may visit and see her then. 


Re: my boyfriend’s situation: he’s not particularly close with his family either, but I think he feels he should come see them this year since he was with my family last year. I think he wants me to come both because, of course, it’s nice to be together over the holidays, and because my being there will make things more fun for him. He says he’ll try his best to make things fun, and I believe him. 


Re: my sister: I’ve talked with her, and while she’d like to see me over Christmas, she’s says she’s okay with my going to my boyfriend’s parents’ if it’s what I want to do, especially since we might see each other over New Year’s.

17,1gozgwq,AITA for calling out my grandparents for stuff they said to my mom in front of their friends and extended family?,"My parents and I (16f) spent Saturday with my dad's family. So when my mom went MIA for a bit longer than usual I went looking for her and found her upset. She said nothing was wrong. But an hour later I heard my grandparents call her a bad mom and I stopped and admittedly I eavesdropped on what they were saying. They were saying mom should be ashamed for crying where I could see and how did my dad ever let her raise me with him when she abandoned me when I was a baby for weeks and didn't even care about me back then. They said mom was a lunatic and should be ashamed of herself for ruining my life.

The context to that is my mom had PPP (post-partum psychosis) after I was born. She got really sick and spent 11 weeks in a hospital/treatment center to help her because she was really at risk. My dad tried to get her help but a lot of people dismissed him. I was maybe 8 or 9 weeks old before someone took him seriously and helped him with mom and got her the help she needed. The experience left them both with trauma and it took mom a long time to recover fully. But when she had, they were afraid to risk more kids and so they decided they were one and done with me. I've always been aware of this.

So hearing my grandparents speak to mom like that was awful. Mom left them while I was still eavesdropping and she pulled me away and said it was okay. A while later a group of us were in the kitchen eating and my grandparents were making comments about how lucky some people were to have lots of grandkids and how much it helps when each kid has more than one. My dad was like wtf at them. That's when I brought up how shitty they were to make more digs at more. I called them out on it. I said it was disgusting and mom didn't deserve the shit they said. My grandparents told me that I didn't understand and I know they love me. I said they sure didn't talk like that. I said calling my mom a lunatic and rubbing it in her face that she only had me and no more with dad, when they know she was sick after me, made it seem like they I wasn't enough for them. I also said it was shitty to shame a woman who made the safest choice for her family. My dad was furious with his parents and asked what the hell was going on. They slipped up and basically confessed that they'd been saying shit to mom since I was a baby and always went behind everyone's backs so we wouldn't know.

They tried to lecture me about calling them out but dad shut it down and asked me and mom to wait in the car. Apparently some of the extended family are anti-me now for calling out my grandparents in front of others and my grandparents are also saying how disrespectful I am. Dad raged at anyone who blamed me. But I do wonder if I should have handled it more privately? Like telling dad instead of calling them out like that.

I (31F) am have a bad relationship (that deteriorated through time) with my aunt and my cousins (26F)(30M).

I'll try be as brief as possible but giving all backgroud details. 

I used to work in their restaurant around 10 years ago, as waitress, and for that year it felt like everything was good with my relatives.
Mid september of that year I found out I was pregnant.l was having some issues that may have lead to abortion so I've decided to tell them in order to avoid doing heavy jobs etc. In that moment her reply was literally ""Don't you worry, we already wanted to find someone else"" . I felt terrible
out for family's sake i kept quiet and moved on. 

I had my beautiful baby boy and she was coming to see him, literally placing herself in my living room and watching the little one sleeping. She also would leave without even saying anything to me, just exchanging few words with my mom if she was present. 

Forward jump to 4 years ago where we did not talk at all (no aunt nor cousins): i had a baby girl but this time i got no messages no congratulations,
nothing. I send invites for baptism but did not got replies if not through my grandma that they all couldn't attend


Last year my cousin (30M) announced his wedding to my mother and grandma but somehow forgot to tell me. Since i am straight forward when we had opportunity to see each other for grandpa's bday i went to them and congratulate because i really was happy for them. He then said if we wanted we could attend their wedding. I had to think on it and decided few weeks later to attend only
the ceremony because it's still my cousin and i love him.

That day my aunt greeted my mother, my grandparents but not me who i was sitting close. That was kind of the final straw. Not even my cousins went to greet me. I made my congratulations to the beautiful bride but kept the money pocket i wanted to gift them and just returned home.

Since then i feel sad if i think about it and i have no idea how to address the matter or how to ask them what's their issue with me.
 

AITA for keeping those money? 
If so please, help me understand how to saw the relationship.

We have two cats, one being a kitten so they play a lot together and sometimes get the zoomies and run through the apartment back and forth. Lately our neighbors downstairs have been banging on their ceiling when the cats run.

I try to be understanding with it in some instances like if it’s late at night or if our bedroom door is open, considering their bedroom is underneath ours. So I’ll try and close the door to that room. But lately they have been doing it during the day, such as around 11am-3pm. Or sometimes around 7pm. This frustrates me as it’s not even quiet hours, and my cats cannot go outside to play, they’re inside and don’t have a choice but to stay inside. They need time to run and exercise. 

I’ve talked to people around me about this situation and they told me it isn’t my problem and I should ignore it because they chose their apartment knowing they’d have upstairs neighbors. And I understand that but I feel guilty or anxiety with the cats just running now because of the loud banging.

There are mutual friends between my husband and close friend, so I made sure to tell her first so she didn’t find out from anyone else. I also had a miscarriage earlier in the year (which I honestly hate talking about out) but I told her about that with the pregnancy news. She congratulated me and gave condolences about my miscarriage, but also slipped in a few passive aggressive comments about how she was so out of the loop and how I could have just told her sooner. I looked past the comments to not create any drama. 

A week later she sent me a very long text about how hurt she is that I didn’t tell her sooner but I told our other friend and that she feels like I don’t trust her. She also said it put her in an unfair position because our mutual friends would bug her asking if I was pregnant and it sucked not to know I actually was. She said she’s been crying over this with how hurt she is and that me not telling her about my miscarriage sooner is even more hurtful that I left her out of the loop. 

I’m a pretty reserved person and don’t get all mushy with baby stuff. It took us almost a year to finally get pregnant and I had a lot of spotting with the first. I didn’t want to tell anyone early (besides my other friend who had been through it) in case it was a miscarriage (which it was) because then it’s so uncomfortable to have to go back and tell people jk I’m not pregnant. It was overall a very stressful and frustrating experience trying to conceive and with the second pregnancy, again I didn’t want to start telling people until we had all the tests come back as low risk. 

I understand that my friend might be upset feeling I don’t trust her, but that’s not it at all and honestly this just has nothing to do with her. I like privacy and really hate talking about my miscarriage and I wish she would just respect that instead of being hurt by it. Her feelings are valid but I wish she had vented to a friend about it instead of me. It’s put a rain cloud on announcing it and the more I think about it, the more annoyed I get that she’s made my pregnancy about her. Am I being unreasonable?

Every time I see them at a family gathering I get stuck watching their four kids. Recently I was invited to Mary’s birthday, I wasn’t going to go but my girlfriend convinced me to go because I haven’t seen my extended family since the last family barbecue in 2022. 

A soon as we got to the party, Mary immediately told me the kids missed me so much and I should go play with them. I politely refused and made my way out to the backyard where everybody was. 

Mary followed behind me and she kept trying to convince me to go up to the kids room. I refused every time and she eventually dropped it and returned to her sister. 

I sat down and my aunt, Beth made a snarky comment about how I was so mean to the kids. I brushed it off and grabbed a glass of wine and some food at the bar, as I sat down to eat I took a big gulp of wine. Mary spotted me and freaked out, yelling at me for being irresponsible, immature and petty then she told me to get out immediately.

Sara and my Beth glared at me and whispered to each other while I grabbed my stuff and left. At home I was bombarded with texts from my aunt and cousins, calling me vindictive, cruel and some other racial slurs I dont wish to repeat here, I ended up blocking them. 

later found out I was only invited to the party to be the babysitter while everyone else enjoyed the party and me drinking wine ruined her plan. Most of my extended family is saying I should have just sucked it up and watched the kids so Mary could enjoy her party. So, AITA?

When he asked this, my heart started beating so fast, I immediately assumed he was saying ""fake proposal"" as a ruse for a real proposal, which is not something we have talked about yet.

I said that I wasn't really interested in a fake proposal picture and that I thought it was weird that he would suggest that. We moved on pretty quickly and went to dinner. 

When we got back to our hotel that evening I asked him about it, since it had been on my mind and I could tell that I had actually really upset him. I asked him explicitly ""were you planning on actually proposing to me and I ruined it?"" and he said no, that he doesn't think we are ready for that step (and for the record, I agree.

31,1gosxj8,AITA for refusing to be excited for my sister (29f) about her pregnancy when she has never met my (26f) children (3M) (2M)? ,"My sister (29F) and I (26F) have always had a troubled relationship and have never seen eye to eye. However we do love each other and would hang out and get along as best as we could when we were younger. 

The problems all started when I got married to my husband (30M) five years ago and had two children shortly after. Throughout my pregnancy my sister didn’t bother to check on me and completely took herself out of my life. I just assumed she was jealous or had some type of issue with me being pregnant.

I was not prepared for what would happen after my first son (3M) was born. She asked me for a picture of him shortly after he was born when we had not spoken the whole time I had been pregnant. I thought that maybe this was a turning point for us and we could finally get along. 

I was very wrong. She has never met either of my sons. I have offered to bring them to see her numerous times but there was always an excuse. She never asked me how they were doing or showed any interest in them. My sister has even boasted about other kids that are her friends children but seems to hate her own nephews. 

I am so confused. The problem has now got even more complicated now that she has announced she is pregnant. I am happy for her but I am still hurt with how she has treated my children and how she treated me during my pregnancy. 

My mum (65F) says I’m being selfish and to just let it go and be excited for her but I’m finding it difficult. I am super excited for her to be a mum but I can’t just forget how she treated me. I want to have a relationship with my niece or nephew but I also don’t know how possible that would be. 

I have reached out to my sister to resolve the issues we have but she is genuinely not interested in resolving anything. She has only got in contact because she is now pregnant. 

Also my mum has tried to talk to her but she isn’t interested and doesn’t give her a reason why she doesn’t want to see my kids either. I do think it’s important to note that my mum wasn’t happy about my pregnancies either and has not made an effort either. 

 I was 23 when I had my first baby and my mum thought I was too young and refused to be supportive through my pregnancy and did it again with my second. 

A little bit more context I am a people pleaser I have always just apologised and let things slide in the past even if they really hurt me.

So AITA?

Small update : I’ve spoken to my mum and I’ve set a boundary with her that she needs to stop pushing me to talk to my sister. I have asked that she apologise for how she treated me during my pregnancy and after and if she can do that then we can work on our relationship. - spent a few hours chatting and she doesn’t see what she did wrong and so low contact for a while. 

My sister is continuing to contact me asking me to plan a baby shower and I have as of now not responded.  


Update on sister : has been blowing up my phone ever since she asked for a baby shower, I’ve muted her on everything, she is adamant that I need to plan this baby shower and be involved and to not ruin her special moment. She’s also using the we are adopted card and saying how I’m her only real sister but where has she been when I needed her? 

I will be speaking to my sister soon as soon as I’m sure I know what to say. She makes me nervous and I don’t want to get sidetracked with what I want to say. 

Update - I have spoken to my sister and told her I will not be planning her baby shower, the reaction was pretty volatile, yelling and cursing. She said I have never been happy for her and that I should be more mature. 

I addressed the fact that she hurt me when she didn’t have contact with my children or even seemed to care about them. She openly responded that she doesn’t care about my ‘brats’ and that her child will be better off than mine are. I told her she can’t pick me up and drop me when she feels like it.

I congratulated her and ended the call soon after this as I didn’t want to hear anymore from her. She did admit to the fact that my mum has been feeding her information about my children whenever she asks which makes me angry. I do not know how I will proceed from here. ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-11,"AITA for refusing to be excited for my sister (29f) about her pregnancy when she has never met my (26f) children (3M) (2M)?  My sister (29F) and I (26F) have always had a troubled relationship and have never seen eye to eye. However we do love each other and would hang out and get along as best as we could when we were younger. 

The problems all started when I got married to my husband (30M) five years ago and had two children shortly after. Throughout my pregnancy my sister didn’t bother to check on me and completely took herself out of my life. I just assumed she was jealous or had some type of issue with me being pregnant.

I was not prepared for what would happen after my first son (3M) was born. She asked me for a picture of him shortly after he was born when we had not spoken the whole time I had been pregnant. I thought that maybe this was a turning point for us and we could finally get along. 

I was very wrong. She has never met either of my sons. I have offered to bring them to see her numerous times but there was always an excuse. She never asked me how they were doing or showed any interest in them. My sister has even boasted about other kids that are her friends children but seems to hate her own nephews.

32,1gost0r,AITA for not spending my son’s birthday with him?,"I 51(F) have one son, I’ll call him Dave for now. Dave is from my previous marriage. My ex husband and I broke up because we were young and inexperienced. Either way after a long period of not talking at all we slowly repaired our relationship and remained friendly for Dave’s sake. 
Both me and my ex husband are remarried. And as odd as it sounds - we all get along. Me, my ex husband, his wife and my husband. They also have two more kids now and I regularly give the older one guitar lessons. 

Dave moved away after deciding to go to Uni when he was 19, and after graduating he decided to continue living further away from us. We still keep in contact - but I’d say I see him a lot less often than I see my ex husbands children. 

Dave’s birthday is on the 26th of December and up until he was 22 we usually got together and celebrated at my house. When he turned 22 - he had a bad allergic reaction to something and the evening was pretty much over - after that he had no interest to celebrate with us again. And for this year he announced as well that he’s not going to celebrate his birthday. Even though it is more significant since he’s turning 25. 

I still am getting him a present and all but I respect that he wishes to spend his day alone or with friends. He then asked me what I would’ve planned for that day since it’s still a holiday and I explained that his dad and his new wife would be coming over with the kids and we would have a little get together. 
I joked that we would be drinking champagne in his name and maybe even bake a cake. He didn’t take that well. He didn’t yell or got loud on the phone but I could hear him mumble something along the lines of “of course you are” and then audibly just said “okay, have fun mom.” 

That was two weeks ago. I haven’t heard from him since and going this long without contact from him is weird, even if it is just a text or a phone call. Every time I tried to call him it goes to voice message and it auto replies with “I’m busy”. 

His dad hasn’t heard anything either but their relationship has been strained for a while. He hasn’t texted his siblings either. I don’t see how I’m in the wrong here since he openly stated he didn’t want to celebrate his birthday. But I would like to hear some opinions. 

Edit: My son’s allergic reaction came from mine and my ex husbands dogs but he knew about them and never once told us to get rid of them 

Edit 2: I think I’ve explained everything in the comments so I have nothing more to say. If someone has genuine advice to offer - thank you.

We spoke about it awhile ago, but of course she gets it. I still planned on coming to the bachelorette party though. 

That is until the date got closer, I started my own business and I just started making money (a salary above the poverty line) like yesterday. I need to throw a shower, get the house ready, do a lot of things that require money and time - it's my first baby.

In addition, her bachelorette is Thanksgiving weekend, and I'm meeting my husband's parents for the first time cause they live far away and we don't have a lot of opportunities to meet. 

I've been super optimistic about doing it all, but it's difficult. I'm 28 weeks pregnant, the bachelorette is in 3 weeks and it's gonna be a 3 days of celebrating that I have so much fomo about, but will also be a lot of drinking based activities too. 

Lastly just the funds, almost $400 for the stay not including food drink and other excursions. I feel like I should be prepared to spend $700 at least. 

I told my friend just today that I don't think I can make it. I felt so bad she sounded disappointed. It was via phone and she was in person with her other friends who were planning the whole thing. She said I should've told her earlier and I agree. It was shitty for me to wait so late I was just really optimistic. I'm also missing her wedding too...

Anyway, am I the asshole? I feel like the asshole.

34,1gos35n,AITA for not putting any effort into a birthday card and gift for my grandmother?,"My grandmother turned 70 two weeks ago. Her kids had a birthday party for her and they got the whole family together to celebrate her. I (16f) didn't make any effort for this. My parents got the card and gift on my behalf and I just signed my name in the card. That was all. My mom tried encouraging me to do more but I had no love or anything to share. At the party when she was opening stuff up I was asked what I got her and I tried to play it off as a wait and see, because I didn't know what my parents got, but someone said surely I could give a hint and I just said it would be something she should like. It ended up being something she didn't like and it caused a lot of controversy and then people figured out that I hadn't chosen it as a gift and my parents did. Which opened up a shitshow.

The reason I didn't make an effort for her is because I mean nothing to her and she expresses it every time our family gets together, which is frequently, and I'm not going to care more than she does.

My grandma was one of those boy moms you know about today. She had five kids, four were boys, my mom, the youngest, was the only girl. I'm also the only granddaughter. She has all grandsons except for me and I'm my parents only child. Grandma still loves on her sons and is always slipping them money and nice gifts. Mom gets shit. With the grandkids? It shows even worse. She will cuddle with, have the boys on her lap, will take them for ice cream, drops lots of money on gifts and not just for birthdays/Christmas but just because. She tells them she loves them every time. Kisses them on the cheek. All that kind of thing.

She has never kissed me, she has never said she loves me, she has never welcomed me into her space for a hug or to sit on her lap. I saw a home video once where they wanted a photo of her and all her grandkids. I was the youngest at the time and a baby. She refused to hold me for the photo and said she wanted the two youngest boys at the time in her arms/on her lap instead. Even made a comment about ""you can just take her out completely"". We did a repeat a few years later that I can remember and I'm the only one who didn't get a turn being hugged or next to her. If I'm lucky I get some kiddy books at Christmas. Like bargain books that you'd get for a couple of dollars each. She never sends me anything for my birthday or even remembers. She never gave me a just because gift. Half the time she doesn't even remember my name. She has no sweet nickname for me. My cousins are all ""lovey"" and I'm not. Oh, and the other thing is she always saves a seat next to her for grandkids to take turns sitting next to her. I never had a turn and was turned away when I tried to sit with her before. 

Even though all of this is open, it's known, and nobody would deny it, I was called out for not putting an effort in. Even mom complained to me on the way home and for a couple of days after.

For reference she is around my height, 5'7 and average weight. She doesn't look fat or chubby at all but she's always saying she looks fat or her brother/ sister said she looks fat. She has said before that she wants to try to loose 10kg even though she is the average weight of a 17 year old girl of her height.

My bsf has had a crush on this guy (18M) for a year now. He is two grades above us and she has never once spoken to him. It's an average crush, y'know, eye contact in the hallway, getting upset when he has a buzzcut etc. She is quite obsessed with him, she knows his birthday, how many siblings he has, where he's from etc. She follows him on Instagram, where he sometimes posts stories of him at the gym and she'll show me them. 

Today, in class, she wrote a note saying ""I will start my fitness journey bc (crush's name) is loosing weight"". I asked her to explain what she's planning and she said she will work out a lot and have a ""very strict diet"". I asked her if she's joking because sometimes she jokes around about things. She said no and that she will start today. I got slightly mad and told her that's very stupid and unhealthy. She laughed.

She then showed me photos of her crush from like 6 months ago and recently telling me he looks so different after going to the gym. No. No he does not. He just got a buzzcut. He does not look skinnier, if anything he looks buff.

Conversation followed the meal when my father asks me to take off my jacket so he can see my chest(I’m a dude). I was uncomfortable with the request at the time so I declined. There were other people around too. Whatever the reason, I said no.

He kept going at it trying to get me to take it off when I would repeatedly say no. Maybe 3 times. At that point he started getting a little angry and I don’t remember what he was saying but I remember pleading, “please stop”, and “I don’t want to fight”. 

It didn’t work as he was totally in the mode to fight for some reason. I asserted that I’m allowed to say no and that he should just drop it. Then, I forgot what he said, but he said something in a way that there was no turning back. Like, “drop what?!” Which just totally conveyed the fact that he was acting on rage and ready to fight at a restaurant. 

Faced with this ridiculous situation, I muttered that I needed to go and left. I’m proud of myself for that. If I was younger I definitely would have fought there. 

When I saw them again, somehow my father talked my mother into saying that I ruined dinner. That me walking away was the ultimate wrong. I countered by saying that my father is the one who gave me no choice but to leave. I saw two options: fight or leave and I wasn’t going to fight at a restaurant. 

My father blames me and says that I ruined dinner and that I could have stayed and ignored him or suggested wrapping up dinner due to the sour mood but that sounds like a load of bs victim blaming to me.

If he wanted to enjoy dinner he could have just taken no for an answer.

When informing my father of this, he calls Dr. Greg a joke and essentially fires him.

37,1goqgfw,AITAH for telling my brother not to make himself a sandwich while my girlfriend cleans the kitchen? ,"Throw away because my girlfriend wouldn't want me to post this under my real username.

My girlfriend (35F) and I (36M) are hosting my brother (34M) for two weeks, because he has a training in our city. It's the first time we've hosted him for this long (usually he comes visit for just a weekend), and for such a long stay, differences in eating habits, cleanliness, helpfulness with chores, etc. are starting to clash (politely, but still).

My girlfriend and I spend a few hours on Saturdays cleaning our apartment and cooking for the next few days. I was hopping my brother would at least propose to help but he hasn't, he went for a walk when we started, came back later and stayed on his laptop, then took a nape. At 4pm he was hungry (he had snaked on a hot dog in town during his walk instead of coming back to eat with us for lunch), so he asked me if he can make himself a sandwich. I said ""sure but if \[my girlfriend\] is cleaning the kitchen, you should wait, or eat a banana or an apple"". I know that my girlfriend doesn't want anyone in the way when she's cleaning a room. She is using that time to call her family. Besides, I was already a bit annoyed that my brother hadn't proposed to help, so to go as far as sitting in the kitchen eating a sandwich while she is cleaning, I found this rude.

He doesn't want a banana and would like bread and ham. I said ""ask \[girlfriend\] if you can, but don't be surprised if she says no"". He went in the kitchen to ask. She was cleaning and calling her mom. The kitchen table was full of stuff (blender, soap, etc.) that she had just put aside, she would have needed to move them to make space for him, or let him use the counter, which she was cleaning. She pointed him to the fruit basket and, just like I did, told him he can have a fruit. He didn't take anything. He came back to me and complained that we are ""extreme"" for not letting him have a sandwich, that he has never seen that anywhere, and that anyone would find it abnormal. I had no response. To me it sounded absolutely normal that if you are invited in someone's home, especially for such a long stay, you don't get in their way when they are busy cleaning. But my girlfriend's mother had overheard on the phone when he had come into the kitchen, and told my girlfriend ""come on, let him have his sandwich, the poor thing will starve"", so she came out and told him he could have it. Now I'm not sure whether we are the AH for telling him no in the first place?

EDIT to make it extra clear: I'm not expecting him to deep-clean our house. I'm expecting him to do the minimum (like putting his cup in the dishwasher, not making a mess that we have to clean after, etc.), I'm a bit annoyed that he doesn't naturally chip in to help when he can, but mostly because that's what I do when I'm invited somewhere (including his place). I see my host doing dishes? I'll take a dishcloth and start drying them, for instance. Or if I'm staying several days, I'll offer to cook a couple of meals. But my post was more about the specific situation of asking him not to go in the kitchen while my girlfriend was cleaning, v.s. my brother thinking he should be able to make himself a sandwich whenever he feels like (and I'm not even strict on that, he made himself a sandwich in the middle of the night, I have no issues with it).",Not the A-hole,2024-11-11,"AITAH for telling my brother not to make himself a sandwich while my girlfriend cleans the kitchen?

My girlfriend (35F) and I (36M) are hosting my brother (34M) for two weeks, because he has a training in our city. It's the first time we've hosted him for this long (usually he comes visit for just a weekend), and for such a long stay, differences in eating habits, cleanliness, helpfulness with chores, etc. are starting to clash (politely, but still).

38,1gopnk3,AITA if I help my BF to add other expenses to the bills so that our roommate's contribute and help?,"My bf(m30) and I(f31) have been together for 3yrs and for the past 2yrs I have been living with him. The home is his parents 3rd home they flip houses. The rent is $900 and we split it between his brother(m28), his bestfriend(m26) and his best friends gf(f20). We all get along great. His brother(Alen) is an introvert and games everyday  and gets paid for it. His best friend(David) and gf(Name her kelly), they both work at restaurants and get paid good. I have my own business and make good money. My bf works in the medical field and makes very good money.

We have a group message where my bf sends reminders about rent bills or any other expenses that are due and how much it is for everyone's portion. Bills are split 5 ways. Normally, everyone pays my bf rent and bills through paypal then sends the rent to his dad. The brother sends it directly to the dad but all other bills to my bf. So bf pays all the bills BUT the two boys pay my bf whenever they can or remember to pay him. Myself and Kelly pay my bf the same day he asks for any bill money and pay rent before he even asks.

So the dilemma is my bf is getting tired of paying the bills and waiting for the others to send him $. Plus he pays for any yard work, house fixing, HOA, helps his best friend with expenses if he needs help, and will eat some of the bill money to pay his best friends bills until he has money to pay back. So after some months of my bf venting to me, stressing out, and being worried about his dad getting upset about late rent...he's starting to get fed up.

So, me being protector of my bf because now I am upset FOR him, i am going to start making some changes to the bill dates. Instead of them paying whenever the bills that need to be paid the first half of the month AND INCLUDE rent, WILL BE PAID on the first. NO LATER than 3 days. Then, the other half of bills will be paid the second half of the month. This will include divided upkeep of the yard, ADDED home repair fee of $6 from EVERYONE incase of any upkeep or emergency, contribute $20 to $30 bucks of grocery money because the kitchen is community property in the house. Everyone f\*\*ken eats everything, plus when I cook ALL THE TIME too and I cook FOR EVERYONE. And most of all, his brother Alen HAS TO PAY some gas, car repairs, and will be added and pay a portion of the insurance. His car broke down 6 months ago BUT big bro has to take him to his work meetings, events, gaming tournaments ect, every month.

We all pay under $260 total with bills split and everything EACH. My bf pays for yard maintenance, home repairs and replaces all AC filters every 2 months.

So, AITA for putting my foot down for my bf and helping him? Am I going a bit too far or too harsh?

Edit to Add: I have yet to address it to everyone in the house. I already had told my BF about all this and he is setting up a meeting today once everyone gets home. He let me know that I helped him get the push he needed to make all this happen. So, we shall what happened. I can update later.

I recently took a gap year from studying and I've been home this year. We have 4 dogs and 3 are great danes, 2 of which are puppies. I take care of them 24/7 without her help. E.g. poop clean, training, feeding, cooking, grooming, etc. I also do all the repairs around the house. E.g. broken taps, pool maintenance, etc.

On top of that I have to take care of her. I have to cook for her, clean the house and pick up after her when she leaves her stuff all over the house.

The other day I managed to do a thorough clean and that's the nicest and most appreciative she's been of me. The next day, I didn't get the chance and I got what I always get. She was annoyed and scolded me for not cleaning when she asked me to. She accused me of sleeping all day and getting nothing done.

I feel like I'm only appreciated when I clean. Maybe she thinks she doesn't have to do anything because she's the one that works. But I know she wouldn't last a second doing what I do. When she's home alone with the dogs, she calls me incessantly asked when I'm coming home and how unhappy she is.

41,1goo0fu,AITAH if I don't want to pay for my friends and want to be informed earlier?,"Every few weeks, my friends and I go out to eat on Sundays. We usually split the bill equally, but if someone doesn’t have enough, they pay what they can, and the rest of us cover it. I always pay my share fully. Recently, two of my friends have been going out without inviting me. Half the time, I’m not included, even when I’m free, because they don’t bother to mention it. Last week, I found out they went out without me, even though they knew I would’ve joined if invited.

Our schools closed recently due to environmental pollution, and we shifted to online classes. I’m serious about my studies and never miss any class, but those two often skip them. Last week, my family went out of town for two days to visit relatives. On Saturday, one of my friends called, saying they were coming over to my house the next day and that we were going out. They also said I should bring extra money because they had already spent all theirs. They had run out of their allowance, which they spent earlier on an occasion I wasn’t even invited to. My allowance is smaller than theirs, and what seems like a reasonable amount to them is a lot for me. My parents don’t give extra money easily, and they’re not even fond of me going out.

I told my friend they should’ve saved and waited until they had enough. I also said they should’ve let me know earlier, at least a day or two before planning. They didn’t even ask if I was okay with their plan. They just said, “We’ll be at your house, and be ready to go, and bring extra money.” I wasn’t happy with that. I told them I wasn’t in town and wouldn’t be back until Monday morning. He called again next night and repeated the same thing. The next morning, I told them to wait until I confirmed. I got delayed because of road closures and smog, and when I finally got home, I found they had been waiting outside my house for an hour. I told him, “Who told you to wait outside? I messaged you to wait.” But still, they waited.

He said to get tomorrow I repeated everything. I felt like I wasn’t being treated fairly. They were acting like I was obligated to go, pay more than usual, and sacrifice my studies.

He didn't make too big a deal of it and it seems like it was something that he could live with but recent problems make me think otherwise.

Over the time I've lived with him he has made it pretty clear that he's not very fond of animals and has even told me to my face that he hates having my cat around and only a few days after that even suggested selling all 4 pigs, simply saying 'bro I'm over these animals. What if we sell the pigs?' referring not just too his pigs but mine too.

44,1gommim,AITA for picking a fight with my bipolar friend?,"My (26 F) best friend (25 F) is diagnosed bipolar (I'm not sure which version, my understanding of the disease is limited to some online research and what little she'll disclose to me when I inquire) and certainly experiences the mood swings indicative of the illness. Throughout our friendship, there have been numerous interactions where she responded in a way that I would not have expected, whether it be intense anger or sadness or glee. While this does come with the package deal of bipolar disorder, I'm not always sure how to respond. 

Recently, she has been experiencing a more depressive period, and as such has been more prone to what she labels ""bipolar rage"" episodes. There's no telling what can set it off, and today it was a trivial disagreement that, had she been at her baseline, would have barely been an argument worthy of a response. Today however, it triggered a bipolar rage, and she responded rudely and hurtfully. She did not call me names, curse me out, or have any sort of extreme response, but for lack of a better term: was a bitch to me. I understand that this was her maintaining self control and inhibiting the true emotions she was feeling in the moment, but for some reason my patience ran out. I responded emotionally in turn, whether it be out of pettiness, exhaustion, or some other unknown force wanting to lean into a fight, and we had a huge argument, the biggest argument we've ever had in our friendship full of swearing, sarcastic comments, and rude remarks. Afterward, she apologized and sent a few articles relating to bipolar disorder that could help me understand why she responded the way she did. I have not typed a response to her apology or the resources she has sent besides a ""thank you"" text. I am very remorseful of the things I said while responding emotionally and am appalled that I could even be as bitchy and petty as I was in that moment. I am unsure if I should respond with my own apology, though I am sorry for what I said, if my apology will just enable these interactions to continue.   
  
I don't know how to be a better friend for her in those moments besides laying down and being a doormat for her to stomp on when her mental illness deems me the enemy, and it is taking a toll on me.

47,1golvod,AITA for leaving my housemates at Universal Studios?,"
Here’s the situation: My housemate (A) was going on a family trip to Universal Studios and was really anxious about driving alone because she hates driving long distances. She even calls people to keep her company on long drives. She was especially nervous because she had to meet her dad’s mistress for the first time. Me and another housemate (B) jokingly offered to go with her, and she got excited, asking if we were serious. We said yes but made it clear we wouldn’t intrude on her family trip, and we’d cover our expenses and sleep in the car if necessary. The hotel ended up being a suite, so we got a twin room.

Before agreeing, I told A I had work at 8 AM the next day, but she reassured me it would be fine. We could leave Thursday night or early Friday morning, and I wouldn’t miss work. I kept checking to make sure it wouldn’t be an inconvenience, and she said it was fine.

A few days before the trip, A asked if I’d ever driven in LA. I told her no, since I’m an inexperienced driver with bad driving anxiety. She asked if I’d be willing to drive back if she couldn’t. I immediately said no, and if that was the case, I’d rather not go. She reassured me it would be fine, and I wouldn’t have to drive.

After a long day at the park, A and C (my roommate who also decided to join the trip) came back to the room. A said, “I’m not driving you home. I’m too tired.” C then said, “If you’re not driving, you need to call out of work.” I was stunned. I reminded them I’d set a boundary about not driving, and they laughed it off like it was a joke, which really upset me.

At this point, I didn’t argue. I just started looking for other options. I found a $180 Uber home. I didn’t want to make a scene, so I accepted it, even though I was upset.

For someone with driving anxiety, especially in LA, asking me to drive was a huge ask. I’ve never driven there, and I’m not comfortable in other people’s cars. It was too much for me, and they kept dismissing it.

So, I asked B if she wanted to leave with me, and we booked an Uber at midnight. We didn’t tell A or C we were leaving because I was too upset. We arrived home around 2 AM, thinking they’d find out in the morning.
Now they’re mad at us for leaving without saying anything. They say we’re the assholes for not checking in or letting them know we were leaving. They heard us leave but didn’t check on us.

After everything, I’ve been distancing myself from A and C because I realized if they’re not even concerned about my well-being enough to check on me when I leave, they’re not really my friends. They think they did nothing wrong and said if I needed to get home so badly, I should’ve driven myself.

49,1gol3i0,AITA for distancing my son from family until I get an apology from them?,"I (26F) and my 7 year old son live about 5 hours away out of state from my family. With us living out of state, the last 2 summers since he’s started school my parents have asked to have him spend the summer with them since they don’t get to see him during the school year except when we visit together for major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. While there have been some things they’ve said or done to him as “discipline” that I don’t agree with and have verbally expressed that to them, he loves them and from what I can tell, has a very good relationship with them. 

At the beginning of this summer, I planned out what days I’d take off work to drive him over and spend a few days with my family before leaving him there and heading back home. I had planned on staying from Thursday night through Monday morning. Since I only see my parents a few times a year due to the distance, I was happy to be home and talk to them about my son’s progress in school and what summer project plans I had for my house while he would be away. One of the summer projects I had for this year was to upgrade his room from a younger child’s room (ages 4-6), to a room that’s more fitting for his age (8+). This would involve changing out some of the furniture, upgrading his bed, donating old toys, and painting the walls a different color. Before we had left, I asked him what color he wanted his room to be. His favorite color is black, so naturally he said he wanted it to be painted black. This is where the problem starts.

I wasn’t totally comfortable with painting his entire room black, but I did want to paint at least some of it the color he wanted. I thought of a compromise by deciding to paint 2 walls black and having those be outer space themed, and then painting the other 2 walls a different color to compliment that. I was having trouble deciding what the other color should be, so I asked my mom what she thought would be a good color to go with the black in his room.

She ended up flat out telling me that I wasn’t going to paint his room black, to which I responded that I was and just wanted to know what might be a good color to go with it. She went on to repeat several times that I wasn’t going to paint it black, escalating it into an argument as I stood my ground. She said I “obviously don’t care about him” if I was going to paint his room such a depressing color, and that I was a bad mom for just giving in to what he wants instead of doing what’s best for him. She then started crying out of frustration because I refused to budge on changing the colors. Once it hit that point, I just dropped the conversation and left the room. 

All of that happened on the Saturday I was there, and I had told my dad about it that same night so he would have a heads up as to why she was acting the way she was afterwards. By that I mean, my mom is the type that will give the silent treatment for months if she feels the need to. She’ll avoid you and act like you don’t exist even if you’re in the same room as her, which in my opinion just causes unnecessary and unwanted tension and awkwardness. Because of that, I decided to ease the tension and make the situation less uncomfortable for everyone by opting to leave Sunday morning instead of Monday as planned.

 As I was packing my stuff up on Sunday and bringing it down to the front door, my mom and dad were both in the kitchen and my dad asked me if I was leaving. When I told him I was, he commented that he thought I was leaving Monday but I explained how there was no point in staying if she was going to be in the mood she was in for the remainder of my time there. He started to try to say I was leaving impulsively and that it wasn’t right to do, then went on to say something along the lines of “Now I know you think you had a terrible childhood and all we did was beat you and your sister, but…” which immediately triggered me to be completely over anything that he was about to say next. Not once have I ever said that, implied that, or even made it seem like I had a terrible childhood. Yes my parents used physical punishment as their way of discipline and there were times where I felt like it was completely unjustified or overdone even to this day, but I do think my childhood in general was good despite the negatives. I had responded by saying “Here you go”, and rolled my eyes because of the overwhelming amount of frustration I feel every time this line gets used against me. 

Well my dad being how he is with his short temper, jumped up and got in my face to yell at me to go fuck myself and get out of his house then. He grabbed some of my stuff, tossed it at the door while using his body to push me towards it, repeatedly asking me to get out. All I said in response was, “Yep, that’s what I was doing,” while getting my things and casually moving to the door. As I was trying to see myself out, he continued to cuss me out and threw my prior financial situation in my face (I got laid off 2 summers ago and had put my pride aside to ask them for help during the transition period between jobs) saying that I couldn’t even take care of my own household and “shouldn’t bite the hand that feeds you”. 

I left, and have barely spoken to them since. The only time I called them that summer was to talk to my son. The only texts that have been sent between us were about arranging pickup at the end of summer for him and any pictures they took of what he did while he was there. I did wish my dad a happy birthday through text in September after debating whether or not to. He gave a heartfelt reply about how he was happy to hear that from me. But other than that, I refuse to have any other conversation with them and just have my son talk to them when they call. 

I personally feel like they both owe me an apology for what they said and did. My sister visited in October to hang out with me and my son during his fall break (she currently lives about 20 minutes away from our parents). She knows about the situation and is the only other person that would know how my parents are since she grew up with them too, and agrees that they should apologize. She called me a few days ago to tell me my mom was asking her if she knew whether or not I’d be coming over for the holidays, and my sister told her I wasn’t planning on it because I want them to apologize first. She said my mom laughed at her and said they have nothing to apologize for, then dropped the conversation completely. Hearing this hurt me deeply and has made me want to completely distance myself from them until I get that. However, with Thanksgiving and Christmas right around the corner, I know my mom will probably ask me if my son can come over even if I don’t. I don’t want to spend the holidays away from my son and would like to spend it as a family, but if I’m going to be disrespected the way I was and told I don’t deserve an apology for it, then I’d rather keep our lives separated from theirs.",TL;DR,2024-11-11,"AITA for distancing my son from family until I get an apology from them?

One of the summer projects I had for this year was to upgrade his room from a younger child’s room (ages 4-6), to a room that’s more fitting for his age (8+). This would involve changing out some of the furniture, upgrading his bed, donating old toys, and painting the walls a different color. Before we had left, I asked him what color he wanted his room to be. His favorite color is black, so naturally he said he wanted it to be painted black. This is where the problem starts.

I wasn’t totally comfortable with painting his entire room black, but I did want to paint at least some of it the color he wanted. I thought of a compromise by deciding to paint 2 walls black and having those be outer space themed, and then painting the other 2 walls a different color to compliment that. I was having trouble deciding what the other color should be, so I asked my mom what she thought would be a good color to go with the black in his room.

She ended up flat out telling me that I wasn’t going to paint his room black, to which I responded that I was and just wanted to know what might be a good color to go with it. She went on to repeat several times that I wasn’t going to paint it black, escalating it into an argument as I stood my ground. She said I “obviously don’t care about him” if I was going to paint his room such a depressing color, and that I was a bad mom for just giving in to what he wants instead of doing what’s best for him. She then started crying out of frustration because I refused to budge on changing the colors. Once it hit that point, I just dropped the conversation and left the room. 

All of that happened on the Saturday I was there, and I had told my dad about it that same night so he would have a heads up as to why she was acting the way she was afterwards. By that I mean, my mom is the type that will give the silent treatment for months if she feels the need to. She’ll avoid you and act like you don’t exist even if you’re in the same room as her, which in my opinion just causes unnecessary and unwanted tension and awkwardness. Because of that, I decided to ease the tension and make the situation less uncomfortable for everyone by opting to leave Sunday morning instead of Monday as planned.

 As I was packing my stuff up on Sunday and bringing it down to the front door, my mom and dad were both in the kitchen and my dad asked me if I was leaving. When I told him I was, he commented that he thought I was leaving Monday but I explained how there was no point in staying if she was going to be in the mood she was in for the remainder of my time there. He started to try to say I was leaving impulsively and that it wasn’t right to do, then went on to say something along the lines of “Now I know you think you had a terrible childhood and all we did was beat you and your sister, but…” which immediately triggered me to be completely over anything that he was about to say next. Not once have I ever said that, implied that, or even made it seem like I had a terrible childhood. Yes my parents used physical punishment as their way of discipline and there were times where I felt like it was completely unjustified or overdone even to this day, but I do think my childhood in general was good despite the negatives. I had responded by saying “Here you go”, and rolled my eyes because of the overwhelming amount of frustration I feel every time this line gets used against me. 

Well my dad being how he is with his short temper, jumped up and got in my face to yell at me to go fuck myself and get out of his house then. He grabbed some of my stuff, tossed it at the door while using his body to push me towards it, repeatedly asking me to get out. All I said in response was, “Yep, that’s what I was doing,” while getting my things and casually moving to the door. As I was trying to see myself out, he continued to cuss me out and threw my prior financial situation in my face (I got laid off 2 summers ago and had put my pride aside to ask them for help during the transition period between jobs) saying that I couldn’t even take care of my own household and “shouldn’t bite the hand that feeds you”. 

I left, and have barely spoken to them since. The only time I called them that summer was to talk to my son. The only texts that have been sent between us were about arranging pickup at the end of summer for him and any pictures they took of what he did while he was there. I did wish my dad a happy birthday through text in September after debating whether or not to. He gave a heartfelt reply about how he was happy to hear that from me. But other than that, I refuse to have any other conversation with them and just have my son talk to them when they call. 

I personally feel like they both owe me an apology for what they said and did. My sister visited in October to hang out with me and my son during his fall break (she currently lives about 20 minutes away from our parents). She knows about the situation and is the only other person that would know how my parents are since she grew up with them too, and agrees that they should apologize. She called me a few days ago to tell me my mom was asking her if she knew whether or not I’d be coming over for the holidays, and my sister told her I wasn’t planning on it because I want them to apologize first. She said my mom laughed at her and said they have nothing to apologize for, then dropped the conversation completely. Hearing this hurt me deeply and has made me want to completely distance myself from them until I get that. However, with Thanksgiving and Christmas right around the corner, I know my mom will probably ask me if my son can come over even if I don’t. I don’t want to spend the holidays away from my son and would like to spend it as a family, but if I’m going to be disrespected the way I was and told I don’t deserve an apology for it, then I’d rather keep our lives separated from theirs.",,0.010648405,0,0

All of my kids are currently living at home with me and my husband for various reasons. Sam's girlfriend Tori 21 and Will's girlfriend Mary 18 also lives with us full time, and Jack GF stays over a lot.

We have a pretty good relationship with all the kids, we don't charge them rent but everyone contribute to the household. We have a couple basic rules-input on utilities, maintain the common areas, etc but one of the rules is no babies, we don't expect our kids to celibate. But we do expect them to be careful. 

On Friday, I found a receipt and saw someone brought a pregnancy test. I immediately took a picture of the receipt and put in the family group chat, I figured the culprit would out themselves. No one confessed, so I said that all girls that live in or visited are taking a pregnancy test because I suspect someone is pregnant. They pretty much lost their minds and told me no and messaged that I was being weird and invasive.

 That is when I got upset and said that if anyone refused a test, they would have to move out. Everyone freaked out and told me that I'm  being emotional and crazy. They decide no one would take a test. I think they assume I will not kick everyone out, but I will because I feel like I'm being gaslit. My youngest Iris is the only one I don't suspect because she is gay, not openly, but I know. I have given everyone the entire weekend to calm down because everyone has been avoiding me and giving me the cold shoulder. I have tried to discuss the situation repeatedly but I have been ignored in person and over phone. 

At this point, I am ready to evict everyone  because someone is blatantly lying and all of the others are backing a lie while living stress free in my house. My husband thinks I should let it go for now because the test might have been negative and if someoneis pregnant we will know soon. But I feel it a larger issue now of my kids disrespecting me by lying to me.

53,1gojsnv,AITA for shutting down an olive branch?,"My older sister 42f (OS) and I (38f) have had a rough relationship since puberty.  She stopped wanting me around and has always made insensitive or rude comments to get under my skin. Last Thanksgiving my younger sister (33f) (YS) and I tried to talk to her about some drama surrounding her visit home and how we felt and it didn't go well. We tried to work on the relationship until around January when YS and I both went no contact. 

The reason for going no contact is because OS was angry we ""ganged up"" on her, that we said what state she could visit, counted my calls versus her calls to each other and then complained to my mother, blamed me for putting it all into YS head that OS was the issue, ect. YS and I had tried to have a reasonable conversation,  YS yelled back at OS after she started yelling, I asked her if she wanted to visit our parents and me not be included, I would stay away. Please just have someone let me know the dates. YS used to be a peacemaker, but is tired of it and has started speaking up when she feels hurt. I had already lowered my contact because of the stress of OS phone calls would cause (about a year or two before) so valid point there. OS had flipped who was yelling in her retelling. I didn't raise my voice once and YS yelled back at OS but OS stood up to yell at me and told YS to stop talking and kept yelling at me. YS then got more aggressive.
Not going to lie, it has been the most peaceful year for me with the no contact. 

This past weekend OS text YS and I stating the following: 'I hate the distance. I wish you guys could see the support I need and I could offer the support you guys need. This is my olive branch. My expectation is you guys can work on building a bridge if so desired. I'm exhausted of trying to build all the bridges in my life'.

YS and I both responded not kindly and OS was apparently drinking (YS and I were unaware). From there OS sent numerous text and then tried calling, which were ignores.

I love her, but her life has been one issue after the other for the last 6-7 years. It started with a bad home life, her parents were constantly fighting/drinking and abusing her. From there, she’s been in multiple toxic relationships with different boyfriends who she’s lived with to avoid going home to her parents. I’ve been encouraging her for years to get her own place so she can have her own safe haven and not have to worry about being kicked out, or abused by anyone but she’s never been ambitious about the idea and has only ever lived at her parents house or the abusive boyfriends places. I’ve been a major support in her life during all these years, endless hours of talking, venting and advice giving, I always try to uplift her spirits and remind her that she can do better for herself, given her a place to do her laundry, shower, etc. I’ve also been trying to connect her with my friend who’s looking to get out of her lease in the hopes that she’ll take it over.

Currently, she is living out of a garage with her current fiancé, theyve been together for about 6 months but they got engaged after being together for 3 weeks. This gave me bad vibes from the very beginning obviously + I hadn’t even met the guy at that point. Come to find out that they have been doing drugs constantly together since the beginning. They were living together at the mom’s house but about 2 months ago, my friend officially cut her mom off and therefore had nowhere to live other than with her fiancé in his garage. She told me they recently decided to stop doing drugs which is great but I guess the honeymoon phase has ended because he does not want to be with her anymore and is treating her very poorly and showing early signs of becoming another toxic abusive idiot. 

She’s been sleeping in her car for the past few days and recently we spoke about her living situation. I moved into my first house with my fiancé about a year ago, we are lucky enough to have a spare room and a decent-sized home. But because of this extra space, she is wanting to live with me and doesn’t understand why i haven’t offered this as an option. Also she does have a job and her own income so she would be capable of at least renting a room somewhere.

56,1goiwna,AITA for ignoring texts that have greatly inconvenienced me?,"
I recently had a frustrating experience with a friend who invited me out for lunch. The day of, I rushed myself and my mom out of the house to make sure I wouldn’t be late. But when I arrived, he told me he was too busy to meet up. Since he was the one who’d invited me, I was already a bit annoyed, but I tried to let it slide—sometimes plans just change. What really bothered me was his lack of accountability or any sign of remorse; instead, he asked me to connect with someone else he’d invited, another friend.

Things only got worse from there. This other friend asked me to check out a specific cafe nearby to see how crowded it was. I told him it was packed, but he kept asking for more details, like whether anyone was leaving soon. When I repeated that it was too crowded, he then asked me to suggest an alternative.

By then, I was already frustrated. Why was I suddenly in charge of scouting locations and planning everything last minute? Eventually, he told me to go to a different cafe nearby, so I walked over—only for him to text that we’d actually be meeting back at the first place.

At this point, I’d had enough. I ignored his messages. It was ridiculous to be sent back and forth, given last-minute responsibilities, and to feel like my time wasn’t valued.

I would like to add that I did not block them on any messaging platform I simply didn’t read any new text they sent, 

After this event they began to use passive aggressive messages which make me think I was indeed the asshole, 

Last night I was invited out for lunch today. I said I wasn’t free as I want to avoid a new occurrence of such an event. They are both pressuring me to join them anyway, should I go?

AITAH? My half-sister sent a message in our families group chat to let us know that my niece would be having her baptism this weekend. She said, “if you want to go, let me know”. I didn’t respond right away and then forgot about it. I am not religious, I believe in things but I don’t believe in organized religion. She knows this about me. She also knows that I work every weekend. I really didn’t place it as something that was of high priority and my adhd brain said, out of sight out of mind. I should also mention that when I looked back at the message to confirm the invitation, my SIL was the only family member that responded she was going. So why am I getting singled out? Also her other half sisters weren’t there and she wasn’t mad that they couldn’t come because one had school. 

Today my mom told me that my sister was complaining that I wasn’t there and that she was really hurt I wasn’t there. My sister has a way of making everything more dramatic than it needs to be, her nickname growing up was DQ. I have gained some really good boundaries and part of that is not being a people pleaser and constantly apologizing for things. I really didn’t feel like I needed to apologize because she knows I work so wouldn’t it be obvious that is where I was? 

I love my niece very much, and of course I want to be there for the big things when I can, but I didn’t realize baptism was such a big deal? I wasn’t raised to go to them, and didn’t spend time in churches growing up. 

Now the sisters are mad at me because I didn’t go and I didn’t RSVP. So, AITAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-11,"AITAH for missing my nieces baptism

59,1goi5oe,AITA for having an emotional reaction against the negativity that my mother breeds into the house? ,"We are a quiet kind of a family set in our routine. There's not much fun and excitement or activity or interaction.

Recently to change things, I decided to make breakfast for my parents and spend some good morning time together. Technically I was trying to build this routine for dad and me. I asked my mum - should I make breakfast for you as well? I was not sure because she finds ways to avoid eating what I cook. She said yes that day. We had a happy breakfast.
The next day, while dad and I were in the kitchen she announced from the bedroom that she has a toothache and won't eat what I'm making. 
It was what I expected. I ignored this.
Dad and I went on to have a good breakfast. But my dad wanting to involved her called her to join us. She came with great reluctance. Dad offered her a byte of what we were eating and she refused many times untill it was uncomfortable. And it felt as though she was humiliation both the food and me. 
I was irritated. I went to the kitchen to wash my plate and found something really silly that pushed me into a fit of rage.

There is a cloth we keep on the counter to rest wet dishes on. I've told mum many time - please keep it horizontally because it holds more dishes. But she doesn't, not even accidentally. So basically I had washed dishes in one hand dripping water while I had to rearrange the cloth on the counter, removing the other dishes already resting on it - all with one hand. It was a small thing. But it just felt like such a futile excercise. It's not as though it would take her a lot of time to keep the cloth that way. why not do it? Is it ego? Is it insecurity that I will take over her way of keeping the house? 

I lashed out at her. I called her immature and said she was playing mind games and has an attitude problem. 

And as I anticipated the breakfast routine is gone and life is back to routine.  When I called her out - she said ""so yes I forgot to keep the cloth a certain way. Say I'll forget again. What will you do? You'll scream at me? If this is how you handle situations you won't be able to do anything in life""
True. Just that I'm already unable to do manythings in life. 

I feel my mother hasn't been able to offer me the space to express my individuality in the house. 
For eg:
1. if I keep the spoons in a specific way in the kitchen I know she will change it back. 
2. If I move the pots in the garden then I know she will put them back the way she wants to keep them. 
3. The eggs in the fridge. I have an organised way of picking them out for use while mum does it randomly so I always rearrange them only to find randomness has been restrored.
4. If I cook something, mum will not eat it nor serve it to my dad. Instead she will push it at the bottom shelf and leave it there to be forgotten.",Asshole,2024-11-11,"AITA for having an emotional reaction against the negativity that my mother breeds into the house?

He thought I had a crush on him and rejected me repeatedly, even though I kept telling him I didn’t like him that way. I dated his best friend for a few months, and he got mad, saying I was “taking” his best friend from him.

After that, we got closer, but he kept accusing me of liking him and wouldn’t let it go. I told him it made me uncomfortable, and after years of him pestering me about it, I finally snapped and told him I didn’t like him because he’s fat, and I don’t want to date someone who’s fat.

I’ve been apologizing for months, and he said he forgave me, but he’s now distant and mean.

62,1gogw26,AITA for making family wait to visit newborn,"My wife and I [35m] just had our first baby. My brother[40m], didn’t ask but told me he was going to come and stay with me for a week to visit his new niece. He’s an overall huge inconvenience but I try to keep it together for the sake of family. 

My thoughts were I’m having a baby, and you want to stay at my house for a week after I come back from the hospital? I told my brother I couldn’t accommodate him, and I wouldn’t be ready for visitors. He objected saying he wants to see his niece as she will be growing fast. I told him how about he visit during Christmas, this way we would be adjusted to parenting and also to allow baby’s immune system to be stronger as it would be cold and flu season. 

He didnt reoly and had family guilt trip me. My mom and my dad were both calling me asking why I wasn’t allowing brother to visit his niece.

Fast forward, we are at the hospital and I find out my brother flew in anyways and is staying with a friend. My parents continue to force me to allow him to see the baby. I explain it’s not my fault he came anyways but I told him in advanced we weren’t planning to have any visitors let alone someone who is coming from airport to airport visiting my newborn.

My parents were both upset at me. This affected the visits from my parents as well as the topic obviously came up and they weren’t happy. It escalated after an unfortunate turn where my wife as admitted to the ER post pregnancy. We were there for about 5 hours until they told us my wife would have to stay overnight. I updated my parents and let them know I’ll be coming home and will have to come back to see her tomorrow. 

Before I left I checked the security cameras to see how baby was doing. The moment I tuned in, my mom and dad were talking about a plan to have my brother hide somewhere nearby, then once I would leave to visit my wife the next day that they would have my brother come over so he could also see the baby.

I was shocked lol. I started shaking. They were not concerned for me and my wife. They saw this as an opportunity to go behind my back. The only visitors we allowed as parents, were our own parents who are all local. I don’t feel like my wishes were unreasonable but they were made out to be. 

Tldr; had a newborn and brother wanted to crash for a week to visit. Told him it wasn’t convenient and asked he come two months later. He came anyways and started a guilt trip which lead up to a plan to sneak into my house while I was gone to visit. Lol.

I’m very lucky to have a close relationship with my family, immediate and extended. My grandma has been one of my biggest advocates and a dear friend and I love her very much. I’m also close with my cousins and I don’t want to be the only one who doesn’t show up to her funeral.

My family all lives relatively near to each other, and they’re all planning to come to her funeral, but it’s a little harder with me. For starters, I’m really poor right now, and last minute flights into my city are VERY expensive (I’m talking $800+) which I dont even have in my bank account nor would my parents be able to foot the bill. Also, I wouldn’t be able to take much time from work or school to go home, and it’s about a day of travel both ways (AKA, I’d be spending close to $1K to be home for a day).

My family, however close we may be, can also be very judgemental. I know there would be a lot of questions and anger if I was the only one of the family that didn’t show up. My family is big on honor and duty, no matter what. They’re fiercely loyal and protective and want everyone to be as such.

Also, (I hope I don’t sound like a jerk here) I don’t necessarily feel a need to be there, seeing as I’ve already had a chance for closure. My grandma had dementia and stopped recognizing me years ago. I lost my grandma long before I lost her physically. I’m also a Christian, so I believe I’ll see her in Heaven and that brings me a lot of comfort.

65,1gogkev,AITA for going on a trip with my ex while dating another girl?,"Hi,

I (27F) have been dating a girl, Abby (27F) for 6 months. I am Bi but fully committed to my relationship with Abby. Before this, I dated my ex (28M) for 3 years. We broke up amicably when he moved to another country for work and we've remained good friends since. We still maintain contact but the feelings aren't there anymore.

I went to China with my ex for a week. We climbed the Great Wall and explored Beijing. We had a great time, and nothing happened between us. Abby was unhappy about this trip but we had planned it before I met her. The issue now is that my ex has suggested another trip to Mongolia for horse riding, visiting a national park, and staying in a Mongolian yurt. I told him I would think about it but Abby is upset that I even considered going. 

I am excited about the Mongolia trip because it seems like a once in a lifetime opportunity. Abby said most people wouldn't be comfortable with their partner going on a solo trip with someone of the gender they're attracted to. In my case, everyone since I am Bi. She also mentioned that the only way she'd be okay with me going on a solo trip is if it were with a married man. I explained that nothing happened during my China trip, and he didn't make any advances. Despite this, she is still unhappy and asked me to make this post.

66,1gogkae,AITA for not going to dinner at my dads one evening?,"My dad (42M) and I (19F) have had a difficult relationship since I was 16. My parents are divorced and really don't get along when it comes to co-parenting, which made most of growing up difficult. When I was 16 I decided to stay full time with my mother for various reasons, non of them being I like her more then my father. To be honest a lot of it had to do with the fact that my dad moved a lot farther away from my high school at the time and he had moved in with his now fiancé and her children (who I do like by the way no problems there) . After I decided this, my dad became really angry with me and we would often get into arguments about how much I will regret choosing to stay with my mother instead of him. This tension has continued to this day, because we would often argue which made seeing him very undesirable and complicated. I do agree that not seeing him much when I was still a minor was not great for our relationship and I wish my choice was taken better and we didn't fight as much, but now that I am an adult I am very busy and often have to plan going to see him around many other things happening in my life like pets, hobbies, work and school.

The main reason I am making this reddit post is because of the recent argument I had with my dad. Things had gotten better recently and I was going to call and chat with him when instead, he phoned me and asked me to come over tonight for dinner because he was about to start working night shifts and would be very busy. I had just gotten home from staying a few nights at my boyfriends house and was feeling really tired and socially drained. I had also had some project work I wanted to finish that night and in general, was not feeling up to it. As I tried to explain this to him he snapped and got very angry with me. He told me ""my priorities were messed up"" and that he was ""very disappointed in me."" He then said I might want to apologize and come over. I was very shocked by this and felt very hurt by his reaction. I tried to explain to him that my priorities are to my own happiness and emotions and that I love him very much and want to find time to see him and he should tell me when he has some free time in the future. He didn't take that well and instead told me that ""I should be able to drop everything to see him,"" and ""You would be so much happier if you were staying with me."" He then finished by saying, ""You will regret this when you are older.""

I haven't responded because I don't know what else to say to make this situation better. I have good people around me like my boyfriend and friends who reassure me that I am not in the wrong, but I can't help but feel like they are bias, and I could still be the asshole. Maybe I should be trying to see him more, I'm not sure.

If there's any advice or reassurance I would appreciate it, thank you.

68,1gog6mf,AITA for taking a few seconds to come up with an opinion and being honest?,"Sorry if my English is a bit odd—it’s not my native language.

I’m (M28) living with a friend (F29) rent-free because I don’t have anywhere else to go right now. She’s incredible: funny, magnetic, and always the life of the party. We’ve been friends for over 10 years, and she’s been incredibly generous by letting me stay. However, being together so much has led to some conflicts.

I’m not the most socially adept person (possibly on the spectrum), so I struggle in certain social situations. My friend often asks for my opinions on things, and while I can't lie and prefer honesty, I'm never mean. Usually, I take a moment to think about my response to avoid sounding negative, as she gets annoyed if she feels criticized, even unintentionally.

We just had an argument because she asked my opinion on an Instagram video she was planning to post about her art. She’s incredibly talented, and I genuinely liked the video, but I thought it showed a bit too much of her work, making it feel repetitive. Before I could even give my feedback, I sighed, anticipating how it might go. That sigh set her off—she said it’s like I’m “speaking” with my sighs and that it’s worse than actually being critical. She wants my response immediately and enthusiastically, and even a pause makes her think I’m not being genuine.

When she started venting, I couldn't interrupt. I often just shut down in these situations, especially since I rely on her support right now. After she finished, I tried laughing a bit to lighten the mood, also bc i find the situation impossible, but that only made things worse, she said i was calling her crazy by laughing and mocking her. Ironically, when she uses humor to diffuse tension, I don’t take offense, but it doesn’t work both ways.

She told me I should just say “yeah, cool” when she asks for my opinion. She admitted that’s what she does if she doesn’t mean it, and she expects me to do the same. But for me, it's hard. I wouldn’t ask for someone’s opinion if I didn’t want an honest answer; if I only wanted compliments, I’d ask for that specifically.

At one point, I tried saying maybe she shouldn't ask for my opinion if she doesn’t want honesty but she didn't like it.

The worst part is she doesn't let me say anything or explain myself because she says anything I say might make things worse, and I don’t know how to respond without risking that. I don’t want to seem ungrateful—I know she’s going above and beyond for me, and I really appreciate her support. Most of the time, our issues are my fault and stem from my own social awkwardness, and I’m trying to be better. She’s an amazing person, probably better than me in many ways, and I don’t want to mess up our friendship.

Then it turned into he doesn’t reach out to us enough and he admitted to pulling back from our family because of personal reasons with my mom (not us).

71,1gog172,AITA for switching hotel rooms last minute after a friend booked one with a bad reputation,"Hey! About a two years ago, my then close friend (23M) who I'll call ""Sam"" booked a hotel room in the city for me (23F) and a group of our friends so we could go to a comic convention nearby over the weekend (from Thursday night - Sunday morning.) He talked about how he had booked the room for remarkably cheap, as it was a very nice hotel. There were five of us in the room, and we all paid him a fifth to room in the suite. 

Early Friday morning, I looked up the hotel on google and found numerous accusations about strange happenings at the location on social media, like staff attempting to break into the rooms, which hit home due to my own personal history. I decided I wanted to leave. I showed it to Sam, who seemed perturbed, but wanted to stay put. We both decided to disclose to the whole group of five what was happening. The verdict was this: I was going to stay (and pay for) a smaller room in the actual hotel where the convention was held, and anyone was free to join me, but they were also were free to stay in Sam's room if they were comfortable. Everyone said they didn't want to split up, and agreed to room in the convention hotel. Sam said he would leave too and ask for a refund for the two nights we would not be staying in his old hotel room.

From my perspective, the actual convention went smoothly, and everyone seemed to have a fun time. Of course I could be biased, because come a few months later, Sam (who had been my friend for five years) stopped responding to me. Over text, I routinely asked why he was ignoring me until he said he wouldn't tell me because he shouldn't have to explain what I did wrong. Our mutual friend convinced him to be forthright, so he then said that what I did at the hotel was rude and domineering, and that he wasn't able to get any reimbursement for his hotel booking. He also said that I owed him money for the entirety of his hotel booking (not just the fifth I initially paid) since I pushed everyone into leaving. I expressed confusion since though I may have overreacted based on emotion, I didn't think I had manipulated/guilted anyone into leaving. 

Sam then said that I did implicitly since I am disabled and an ambulatory wheelchair user (I need a walking aid when I stand or walk for more than a few minutes, so I would be using a chair on the convention floor.) I was confused by him saying that, as I never said or even implied I needed help/couldn't stay in the room independently because of my disability. 

After some back and forth, we agreed to call our friendship quits. I understand that in order for a close friendship to fracture, there likely has to be other factors, but he did not disclose those issues, instead focusing on the monetary aspect.

Well this summer my mom lost her new job (both times due to automation/AI) and still hasn’t found full time work. She’s been feeling really bad about not contributing financially. But then about two months into her unemployment she got caught shoplifting and is now having to go to court and my sister and I had to go and bail her out. She says it’s because she felt so bad about not being able to help provide and so was trying to get us groceries. 

I understand the part about her feeling bad, but honestly I’m having a hard time forgiving her for this. How’s she going to get full time work now that she has a criminal record? Why didn’t she think that we’d keep providing until she got on her feet? And she keeps talking about it in a joking way/as if it’s not a big deal. Which could be self-denial or trying to keep us from worrying, but I also fear she doesn’t fully understand the gravity of the situation. She also has made no effort to get a lawyer and she’s not familiar with court stuff or been researching it. 

I see her trying to get jobs and she’s always on indeed but she was super resistant to letting me help her with her resume. When she finally did I saw that she’d been sending people a huge document of job related stuff with explanations of why she got laid off that didn’t really look like a resume at all. I made a new one for her and idk if she’s using it. She’s gotten a few interviews but hasn’t made it past the interview stage.

I never imagined myself actually making an AITA post but everyone thinks I'm one so here we are. I (38F) am visiting my brother(42M) and his family in NYC, let's call him Jake. Since the exchange rate on my credit card is so expensive I took out a bunch of cash when I got to America (I live in Canada) and decided to just get a MetroCard with $100 on it because I figured we'd be taking the train a lot since Jake doesn't have a car. (FYI I'm staying for 2.5 weeks). Jake found out I put that much money on the card and said that since I probably wouldn't use all of it (I think I will) I should pay for them as well because I don't even live in NYC. I said no, and now Jake won't go anywhere with me and refuses to show me NYC. So reddit, what do you think? AITA?

  
EDIT:

Okay, so I've gotten a lot of comments asking about more specifics. I am staying with Jake but he has been begging me to come to NYC and have him show me around, so I didn't ask.

74,1gof9ib,AITA for wanting to cut contact with my only parent as soon as possible?,"For some background information my Mom has always had a thing for foreigners, anything they wanted she would do it.
When I was 12 I put the pieces together and realised I was only born so my mother could keep one of her foreign men.


When I was growing up she never really seemed interested in me and would always be shouting.
Once when I was 12 (yes 12 again because I was mature for 12) I felt like my moms shouting and abuse threats had impacted me, I called her (since I was out and didn't really want to talk to her face to face about it) and I explained how what she was doing was making my mental health take a serious toll.
She called bullshit and hung up.

Nowadays she doesn't want to do anything for me,even the smallest things like hell me with washing up or looking for something.

All throughout my childhood (and still) it felt like she didn't care about me.

She still is the person that raised me but I'm not sure if I want to be in contact with her when I'm older.

Does this make me an asshole?",TL;DR,2024-11-11,"AITA for wanting to cut contact with my only parent as soon as possible? For some background information my Mom has always had a thing for foreigners, anything they wanted she would do it.

75,1goevak,AITA? Future Mother-in-law & planning our wedding ,"My fiancé (M22) and I (F22) are planning our wedding out and we’ve decided we want to elope then hosting a small wedding reception at our home after. My future mother-in-law is not taking this well. 

I do not have any family left on my side to invite so I feel that having a wedding is honestly just going to make me depressed because it’s not going to be what I dreamt it would be when I was a kid and it’s expensive for something that is not important to us. 
Even the wedding reception would be to appease family and friends who want to be included and celebrate us because it’s also not important to us. I’ve considered after this conversation if I even want to do a reception at all if it’s going to potentially bring drama or bad vibes.

I’ve made sure my fiancé is on the same page as me with everything so I’m not just deciding everything for us both. But, his mother after we hosted dinner at our house, told me she hadn’t met my mother and I was like “yeah…that’s not something that will happen, I don’t have a relationship with her.” And she was like “what? Not at all?? You don’t talk to any of your family?” I then communicated that I didn’t want a ‘wedding’ and would like to just host the reception. Her response was ‘this is her only son’ and I shouldn’t exclude everyone else just because I didn’t have family. She even went as far as to ask if I had friends… (I do have friends however I moved far away from the majority of them to be with my partner.). She then offered to pay for the reception venue in hopes we’d change our minds which I didn’t expect. They also offered to invite their ‘rich’ friends to essentially buy us gifts etc. (this is NOT something we care about in the slightest)

I want to start off having a good relationship with her in our marriage and I know it’s my wedding but am I being selfish to make these calls? Is it exclusive for me to not do an actual wedding or if I do decide no reception either? I’m just kind of torn ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-11,"AITA?
