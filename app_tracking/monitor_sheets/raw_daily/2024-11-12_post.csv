0,1gpy9ae,WIBTA if I went to my ex’s favorite bands show? ,"My ex and I are no contact but we plan on reconnecting in the future, taking this time to figure out our goals and wishes in a relationship. 

One of her favorite artists, who’s from Europe, is coming to LA. Briefly after we broke up she mentioned that maybe we could go together. 

The other day I went and bought myself a ticket. It’s a metal band and although they’re not my fav metal band, I still rock with their music and some of the other artists that will be there.

Because we’re no contact, I’m unsure if she has a ticket or not and am not asking. I fully plan on going alone but I’m experiencing some guilt. This is something she’s been unbelievably excited for, but also there’s a strong chance she forgot about it and hasn’t bought a ticket yet (they may actually be sold out idk).

Would I be the asshole if I went to my ex’s favorite band without her? I know I can do whatever I want, but I worry she’ll find out and feel hurt and offended I went without her. A week or so after the show is scheduled is around the time we agreed one of us can reach out and go from there. ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-12,"WIBTA if I went to my ex’s favorite bands show?

1,1gpxx4x,WIBTA for not letting my young sister’s friend to stay over every night,"Hi im 28F, living with my parents and young sister’s 16F in an apartment that I pay the rent and electric bills. I pay for groceries as well in the point that I dont have any savings for myself. I do chores as well. Parents have work and help as well with our expenses. Sister does not work as she is still studying.

I am ok with myself with this situation as I am single anyway and I feel comfortable living with my parents and sister.

Here is my issue, I dont like when my little sister’s friends stay over. Its a past issue within us last few years ago, she always bring friends over, letting to stay over for friday night till sunday night which I am ok as I think this is normal for a friends stay over but it become like they are also there during school night and literally sleeps over everynight now. It started to affect to myself, like I have let them know that they are noisy, dirty bathroom that I have to share with them, more cleaning to do. I always fight with my sister and she started being disrespectful to me it went to the point that I dont speak to her anymore as I was told by parents that I have to
stop caring.

she got in trouble with this friends of hers and did even go to school as she is concerned about bullying and harassment.

It changes last year as she got a boyfriend that always with her technically live with us too for 9 months, he sleep eats with us for 1 week then they stay over at the boyfriends family for 1 week as well. I am uncomfortable with this but i was told not to stay anything so had to endure this for 9 months.

and now this week, she changed again, broke up with her bf and she became friend again with one of her toxic friends and she started sleeping over since  last thursday. I am ok a bit annoyed, until yesterday, I found out that my sister let her be alone in our apartment use electric and food as she went to school and we work as per usual. I started asking to all of them that if this living situation will become like this and wont change and I told them I dont want to pay for everything if they will let someone live with us. I told them we can half the pay of the apartment. They see me as an ASSHOLE

They told me that the friend , she is not living in our apartment  as she have a very beautiful house compare to our ugly 3 bed room apartment and she is just visiting and she is with us she have a problem with her parents.

my question: is her friend technically living with us if she stay over everynight, eat our food and use everything or just visiting?

For example:

-""Oh my god, you're soooo pretty for a white person""
-Comments about being attracted to every race except white people (this one I don't really care about since it's a personal preference, but it's that kind of stuff)
-Making fun of one of the other white girls in our group behind her back because of how pale her skin is
-They have a group chat that's only POC, which I understand wanting a safe space, but there's only 2 people that aren't POC in the group, including myself, so it just feels really exclusionary
-Other super small jokes about white people. I get that they're jokes, but they don't do this about any other race in our friend group - I mean stuff like ""Oh this is some white people shit"", etc

I bought them gifts for hosting me. We came for Easter. when we were touring the home I noticed his mom had little baskets filled with goodies for everyone in their perspective rooms, including an opera singer they were hosting. Mine had nothing. I brushed it off as they didn’t owe me anything. his mom was upset anytime she saw him doing something for me and insisted I “be more helpful”. His sister was upset b/c we went out & he paid for my food but not hers. she took us to a store she loved, then was upset he bought me gifts (IN SECRECY!!!

6,1gpwuzr,AITA for telling my roommate to use her controllers despite having shared ones?,"I (23F) share a four-bedroom, two-bath apartment with three roommates: including, Taylor (22F). We all get along for the most part, and we share a combined kitchen and living room where we often hang out and game together. Six months ago, Taylor bought a used Nintendo Switch and set it up in the living room, saying we could use it as long as she wasn’t around. It felt like a generous, shared setup, and everyone chipped in a little for games we wanted to play.

Initially, Taylor’s setup included two of the four off-brand Joy-Cons, and she was okay with everyone using her things. She did make a random comment, “if you’re playing, I’m going to want to play” but I didn’t think much of it.  But soon after, she started taking the Switch to her room and would often say “no” when we wanted to play, even when she’d be out for work. This inconsistency was frustrating, especially since it was understood that reserving the living room usually meant hosting game nights with guests. While I respected that it was her console, it was annoying to have her switch between sharing and withholding it unpredictably. Not telling us she didn’t want to share anymore or why she suddenly switched the vibes.

So, I decided to get my own Switch for the living room, complete with two sets of Joy-Cons, a multi-charging console, an SD card, an online membership, and off-brand Pro controllers. When the three of us got back, when Taylor was in her room, we set everything up. When Taylor saw it, she seemed annoyed but said nothing. This new setup seemed like the perfect solution; now, we could game without worrying about Taylor’s availability.

However, things got complicated. I started noticing my Joy-Cons weren’t in the living room. I’d leave them there, but when I wanted to play, they’d be in Taylor’s room. While Taylor has her own blue and red Joy-Cons, I’d bought neon pink and green ones, which should’ve been easy to keep separate. I even marked mine with a small dot to prevent confusion, but I’d still have to track them down.

Taylor would frequently take my controllers and accessories without asking, even bringing them to her aunt’s house. When I confronted her, she claimed mine were “newer and better.” I reminded her that I bought my setup to share in the living room and suggested she use her own controllers before taking mine. She argued that since she shared her Switch initially, it was “only fair” she could use my accessories as she pleased.

Frustrated, I told her she couldn’t use my stuff without asking anymore, especially if it was leaving the house. Now Taylor is upset, claiming I’m selfish and don’t understand “shared space” rules, and she points out that I’d used her Switch for months, wearing down her controllers. However, I only used her setup in the living room and mostly when we were gaming together.

8,1gpwczc,AITA for not accepting when my friend says she's fine? ,"Am i the asshole for not accepting when my friend says “she’s okay” ? 

I 15M and my friend 15F (Jamie) are in a trio group with Jessica (15F). This past week she has been visibly down, crying, stressed. We asked her if she was okay and she said “yes”. we left it at that. But, she started to drift away from us, even storming off from us and being “fine” one second then becoming more and more anxious. 

We questioned what it was. she said “it doesn't matter” or “it's fine”. we would’ve let this go if it wasn’t for the fact she started behaving differently towards us. we wouldn’t pressure her to say if something was wrong at home or with school but it was clear something we did contributed to her overthinking. We want to know so we can reassure her and make sure we try not to make this mistake again. We talked to her about this (writing down ideas and asking her what about us made her spiral) and she kept saying “it’s stupid” or “it doesn’t matter” and just avoided answering the question. 

We put together her texts and realized something we said triggered her into overthinking. As time went on, the most she revealed was I said a word that made her overthink. The hangout continued to be quiet and she cried in silence a couple of times but I would ask if she was okay and she would say “it doesn't matter”. She even showed us her notes about how she feels like everyone hates her, how she feels lonely, and thinking we're fake and don't know who we are. But she blanked the word, the one I said to make her feel this way. We tried to ask her multiple times what the word was but said it was “stupid” and “pathetic”.

Here is where we could be the asshole. She calls us inconsiderate and is mad at us for not believing her when she says she’s fine but how could we when she’s clearly upset about something that we might've done (she won't confirm nor deny). When we got back to school, she proceeded to show people this note we left her (saying tomorrow to meet us if you want to talk) and demanded to see the texts between Jamie and I. She's saying how now she hates herself and how we made a big deal out of nothing. That we should've moved on and moved past this because this is making her feel and she'd rather not feel. But this is also affecting us. We constantly have to hear about school or family issues and how she feels like she's drowning bc of her anxiety and we listen and give her space. Sometimes we give advice (like how to find a therapist and how to talk to someone about it) but she just turns down out options and comes up with why she's not able to do that. 

If you want me to accept that you are “ok”, which is blindly translating to the fact that it seems like i dont care, then fine. we won't bring it up anymore. but sad lunches cannot happen.

we can all have bad days, bad weeks, but not talking about the two people who could've made it worse is shitty for us too. now she's mad at us. 

So am i the asshole for not accepting when my friend says “she’s okay”?

But she blanked the word, the one I said to make her feel this way. We tried to ask her multiple times what the word was but said it was “stupid” and “pathetic”.

Here is where we could be the asshole. She calls us inconsiderate and is mad at us for not believing her when she says she’s fine but how could we when she’s clearly upset about something that we might've done (she won't confirm nor deny). When we got back to school, she proceeded to show people this note we left her (saying tomorrow to meet us if you want to talk) and demanded to see the texts between Jamie and I. She's saying how now she hates herself and how we made a big deal out of nothing. That we should've moved on and moved past this because this is making her feel and she'd rather not feel. But this is also affecting us. We constantly have to hear about school or family issues and how she feels like she's drowning bc of her anxiety and we listen and give her space. Sometimes we give advice (like how to find a therapist and how to talk to someone about it) but she just turns down out options and comes up with why she's not able to do that. 

If you want me to accept that you are “ok”, which is blindly translating to the fact that it seems like i dont care, then fine. we won't bring it up anymore. but sad lunches cannot happen.

we can all have bad days, bad weeks, but not talking about the two people who could've made it worse is shitty for us too. now she's mad at us. 

So am i the asshole for not accepting when my friend says “she’s okay”?

9,1gpw43i,AITA for telling my favorite music teacher a decade later that they killed my interest in music?,"TLDR: I was unintentionally super mean to an old teacher, AITA for never trying to clear things up?

I visited my old highschool and ran into a couple of my old music teachers: Mr. Funk, my rock band instructor, and Dr. Chad, my music theory teacher (and Mr. Funk's boss - a relevant detail I didn't consider at the time).

Back in the day, Mr. Funk had invited me to sing in his advanced course after overhearing me jam with some classmates after school. I ended up getting to belt out some cool older songs that year at some fundraisers and other school events. 

It was my first time performing as a solo vocalist, which was a lot of fun - but with the inexperienced, pubescent voice of a teenager, I messed up a lot. Everyone else was cool about it, but I still developed a surprising amount of anxiety. I learned a ton about music that year, but I think the most vital lesson was about how hard I am on myself, especially when it comes to music.

I'd been planning a career in music, and realized I wouldn't be able to handle the kind of pressure that most professional musicians tend to live with. I can say today that realization actually saved my life. Now I have a stable career, and still enjoy music as a hobby. And I give a lot of credit for my happiness to Mr. Funk.

So when the conversation got to the point where Mr. Funk asked if I was still into music, all of this rushed through my mind. With a genuinely happy smile I replied: ""**If there's one thing I learned in your class, it's that I have no future in music.**"" He got a look in his eye I hadn't seen before, nodded, then said goodbye and left to his office without another word. 

Dr. Chad looked a little surprised but made no comments, so I didn't give it any more thought - I assumed Mr. Funk just needed to get back to work. I was even happy that I'd gotten to tell one of my favorite teachers how much I appreciate them. Life moved on, and I soon forgot about the exchange entirely.

...Until one random night, years later. The scene popped into my head clearly, especially the look on Mr. Funk's face. This time, I knew exactly what it was: sadness. A student he'd supported and seen potential in, had just said he was the reason they'd given up. There was humiliation in his eyes too, as I'd said it in front of his boss. I'll never forget the way he shrank and his usually cheerful glow faded as he stepped away.

I was definitely the asshole for saying that. My question for you is actually about the fact that I never tried to clear things up with him since realizing it. It seems ridiculous: ""Hey Mr. Funk, you remember when I was a total dick? Sorry, that's not what I meant..."" What if I'm wrong, and he actually didn't think much of it at all, so I'm making a big deal of nothing? Or what if it meant even more to him than I imagine, and dragging it back up is just reopening wounds for my own selfishness?

10,1gpvx1e,WIBTA If I told my brother’s girlfriend that my mom is not her mom?,"My brother (21M) has a girlfriend (21F) who is starting to get on a lot of my (24F) family’s nerves for different reasons. They’ve been together for almost 4 years. 

The most prevalent issue to me is the ownership she seems to feel over my mom. My mom and I have always been really close, like insanely close. My brother’s girlfriend acts like she is jealous of that and is trying to have that same relationship with my mom. 

For one thing, she calls my mom, “Mama.” She claims that she couldn’t say her name when her and my brother first got together. She also claims that she came up with the term “mama,” because I called my mom “mom.” I had long called my mom, “Mama” and that was even her name in my phone but now when I say the term I am accused of copying my brother’s girlfriend. However, I don’t think she should even be calling her that, because she’s not her mom. I shouldn’t be having to compete over what I’m allowed to call my own mom. 

Secondly, she is acting like she knows my mom more than I do. I moved 2.5 hours away for a year. Now I visited at least every other weekend and sometimes stayed for days on end. I talked to my mom on the phone every single day for hours and hours and hours. Now, my brother’s girlfriend is claiming that I was gone for a year and that she has gotten to know my mom better than I do. My mom and I actually got into a very small argument one morning and I was like “why are you being mean?” My brother’s girlfriend jumped in and said, “She’s always like that, you’ll get used to it.” I was livid. How is she going to get involved in my argument with my own mom and pretend she knows what she’s like and I don’t? 

She also invites herself to things my mom and I do alone. She puts herself into my mom and I’d traditions. Things my brother has never been apart of. She also comes over when my brother’s working and my mom and I are left to babysit her. She even physically gets between my mom and I at times. Also, she oversteps her boundaries at my mom’s house. She was eating groceries as my mom was putting them away instead of helping her clean up. She answers my mom’s phone out of her own pocket! 

I feel like I’m getting to my boiling point and I think I either need to say something to her or my brother. I don’t want to have to compete with my brother’s girlfriend for my own mom. 




Edited to add: Yes my mom is bothered by a lot of this. She doesn’t talk to my brother about it because he is very sensitive about his girlfriend and would likely blow up over it.

I (27F) have been best friends with “Claire” (28F) since high school. When she asked me to be her Maid of Honor, I was thrilled and went all out to make her wedding special. I paid for the bridal shower, bachelorette party (a weekend trip), decorations, and other expenses, spending several thousand dollars. While it was a lot of money for my husband and me, I wanted to make her big day perfect because she’s like family to me.

Two months ago, I shared that I’m 4 months pregnant. Claire congratulated me but started acting distant afterward. She excluded me from conversations about the wedding and made passive comments about how “hard it is to coordinate” when people are “distracted.” I brushed it off, thinking it was wedding stress.

A few days ago, she sat me down and told me she didn’t want me in the wedding anymore. Her reason? I’m “getting too fat,” and she doesn’t want me in the pictures. She said she has a specific “vision” for her wedding, and I no longer fit it. I was devastated. I asked if this was about my pregnancy, but she insisted it wasn’t personal. She said she was replacing me as MOH with another friend who fit her “aesthetic.”

I told her if I wasn’t in the wedding, I wouldn’t attend at all. I also handed her the receipts for everything I’d paid for and told her she or her fiancé needed to reimburse me since I’d only spent that money as her MOH. Claire flipped out, calling me selfish and accusing me of trying to ruin her wedding. She said it was “tacky” to ask for the money back and that expenses like these were “my responsibility as MOH.” I reminded her that she removed me from that role, so those expenses were no longer mine.

Since then, Claire, her fiancé, and even her family have been spamming me with calls and texts. They’re accusing me of being petty and overreacting because of “pregnancy hormones.” They’re also saying I should’ve just let it go and written off the money because weddings are stressful, and Claire didn’t mean to hurt me.

My husband has been incredibly supportive and says I did the right thing. He’s furious at how Claire treated me and agrees that I shouldn’t be out thousands of dollars for a wedding I’m not part of.

13,1gpuywe,AITA for rejecting family names for our baby?,"I (28f) am pregnant with my first child with my husband. We're struggling to find a name right now. We both had to compromise but I feel like I had to compromise more already, and my husband would agree, but he feels like it makes the most sense for me to make the biggest compromise. I like names that he finds weird. Softer, more naturey and whimsical names that aren't super common. So names like Meadow and Seraphina for a girl or Cassius and Hawthorn for a boy. But my husband is very against those now. When we first met his taste was more in line with mine but has become more traditional in the last 6-7 years. His choices are more like Charles or George for a boy and Evelyn and Elizabeth for a girl. For me his choices are a little too common and a little boring/oldish for me. I know Elizabeth is very timeless but that doesn't draw me in.

So we're trying to look for classic names that aren't as common. Nothing whimsical or nature based, nothing weird to my husband and nothing too uncommon. 

There's only one name that's a real contender right now and that's Alannah if we have a girl. But even then my husband doesn't really think the name sounds that good and he hates that there are multiple correct ways to spell the name.

This led to him and his family saying we should use family names. I'm not fond of the idea and I don't like the names we'd have to select from. He thinks it's the easiest way to compromise. I disagree. He told me family names would give us both something. I just think that's his way of trying to get an older sounding name. His family are big on using family names so they think I'm very unreasonable. I suggested to him we could save the family names for the middle but he said that's a waste of time and first names are where we should use family names.

I have kept my stance and my husband and his family think I'm unreasonable for doing so. Although he has suggested some non-family names since this disagreement started too so we're at least not at a standstill. But I know he's not happy with me.

15,1gpuqs5,AITA For upsetting my daughter by having no empathy?,"When I married my ex wife she had a toddler in tow and was pregnant with another baby (both kids were her ex husbands). When the baby was born she had some problems and spent a few weeks in the neonatal intensive care. My ex wouldn’t visit her as she said it was too stressful. I’d become very attached to the baby and used to go visit two or three times a day depending on work schedule.

Baby made good progress and came home. Ex never really warmed to her. Never out and out cruel, but definitely treated her differently to the older child. Few years later and we had a baby of our own. I was ecstatic, had a woman I loved and three beautiful, well behaved kids, a home and all that went with it.

Fast forward to the baby being two and I found out the ex was cheating. She upped and left with the kids and effectively disappeared. I spent a lot of time and money taking her to court for access and getting nowhere. She’d promise that she’d behave to the judge and we’d leave court with visitation etc in place. Couple of weeks later and she’d break all the agreements. Back to court and same again. Thing was, I was paying for my solicitor myself, she was on legal aid, so it cost her nothing to mess about. I nearly went bankrupt.

It was 15 years before I saw my daughter again. The two older kids want nothing to do with me because of the stories their mother told them. The youngest found out about the lies by talking to her mother’s ex best friend, and we’ve developed quite a close relationship. I’ve bumped into the ex when visiting my daughter and I’ve been polite but cool. She’s commented to my daughter that “enough time’s passed” and “it’s all water under the bridge, and he should let it go and be friendly “. I replied that I wouldn’t piss in her mouth if her teeth were on fire, which didn’t go down too well but, well, I don’t really care.

That was a few years back. Recently my daughter told me that her mother is struggling. Apparently she is showing signs of dementia and her physical health is declining too. Daughter suggested I should feel sorry for her mother. I suggested I should polish my dancing shoes and practice a routine for when she pegs it and I get to dance in her grave.

So that’s it. AITA for not having any empathy for the witch that broke my heart and took everything away from me just so she could get her jollies?

PS the guy she left me for wasn’t the first she’d messed around with, he was just the first to offer her a better life.

Baby made good progress and came home. Ex never really warmed to her. Never out and out cruel, but definitely treated her differently to the older child. Few years later and we had a baby of our own. I was ecstatic, had a woman I loved and three beautiful, well behaved kids, a home and all that went with it.

Fast forward to the baby being two and I found out the ex was cheating. She upped and left with the kids and effectively disappeared. I spent a lot of time and money taking her to court for access and getting nowhere. She’d promise that she’d behave to the judge and we’d leave court with visitation etc in place. Couple of weeks later and she’d break all the agreements. Back to court and same again. Thing was, I was paying for my solicitor myself, she was on legal aid, so it cost her nothing to mess about. I nearly went bankrupt.

It was 15 years before I saw my daughter again. The two older kids want nothing to do with me because of the stories their mother told them. The youngest found out about the lies by talking to her mother’s ex best friend, and we’ve developed quite a close relationship. I’ve bumped into the ex when visiting my daughter and I’ve been polite but cool. She’s commented to my daughter that “enough time’s passed” and “it’s all water under the bridge, and he should let it go and be friendly “. I replied that I wouldn’t piss in her mouth if her teeth were on fire, which didn’t go down too well but, well, I don’t really care.

That was a few years back. Recently my daughter told me that her mother is struggling. Apparently she is showing signs of dementia and her physical health is declining too. Daughter suggested I should feel sorry for her mother. I suggested I should polish my dancing shoes and practice a routine for when she pegs it and I get to dance in her grave.

So that’s it. AITA for not having any empathy for the witch that broke my heart and took everything away from me just so she could get her jollies?

PS the guy she left me for wasn’t the first she’d messed around with, he was just the first to offer her a better life.

16,1gpuan3,WIBTA for keeping my toddler from her grandparents because they refuse to take action against my uncle,"Edit: Thank you everyone for your comments.  I will always put the safety of my child before anything.  I think we have some tough discussions ahead of us with my parents. I really needed this support today to stand strong on my convictions. I contacted child care today and my toddler can go full time most weeks for the next few months.  My work will give me leave for the rest

Me (38) and my husband (33) have a 2 and a half year old child. We both work full time and one day a week my toddler goes to my parents, the rest of the time she is in child care. This has been going on for over 2 years and my toddler has a great relationship with my parents.

15 years ago my grandmother died and there was some contention about the will. At the time my uncles were basically all trying to sue each other for anything possible. Over the years the estate has basically been worn down to nothing due to legal fees. One uncle has acted especially crazy during this time. Writing and hand delivering threatening letters, stalking the rest of the family at Christmas and at one point slamming open my front door and screaming at me , most of this behavior has been directed at my parents and one other of my uncles. Over the years I have encouraged my parents to report these incidences to the police and they have refused. (costs nothing to make a police report). These behaviors often ebb and flow around court dates or anniversaries, sometimes there is no contact for months and some weeks will be everyday.

Recently as a court date is coming up, the uncles behavior has escalated. He is often sleeping in his car outside houses, been screaming at my parents front door and was pouring round up on pot plants at my uncles house as well as contacting my ex husband. I am worried that he has become unhinged as his behavior is escalating and he has no one and nothing left. I have done the research into what needs to be done including talking to the police to try to protect myself and my family. The police told me that based on his behavior my parents could take out a personal protection order (PPO) against him, all they would need is police reports or evidence of this behavior. I have installed ring doorbells at my parents place to start to gather video evidence, I already have one at mine. I have sent my parents information to get an PPO against my uncle and information about trespassing. I sat down with them and asked them to make police reports for any future events. My father refused and said he doesn’t want to – no reason given. And my mother expressed that she didn’t want to spend the money to serve him with the PPO if granted (less than $200). I said I don’t want my child at their place until something is in place to protect them. My dad responded that I better put my child in for an extra day of care and I walked out.

I am now fully intending to either wear the cost of the extra day of care or use leave to cover the extra day until either a PPO is in place which may take months or years if they continue with their inaction.

I (21F) like gaming a lot, mostly Fortnite and Call of Duty.

I play with some of my online friends, and I know gaming can be frustrating and difficult sometimes.

My friends (M19-23) start getting mad really quickly. After a couple of rounds of the new Call of Duty, they began making racist and homophobic jokes about the opponents.

That made me really angry, so I left the match and told them to grow up before leaving.
Now, I'm getting messages from them saying that I need to grow up and that they weren't being serious-it was just their frustration talking.

19,1gptxs1,AITA for accusing my best friend of trying to control my life? ,"Last year,  i got involved in a very tense situation between myself and my best friend. 

When i first met Sarah, she was actually dating my ex, Blake, at the time. He never stuck around and never knew what he wanted from me or our relationship, so i didn’t mind the two of them being together even with me and Sarah becoming friends. It actually seemed to make us closer, even after i briefly got back with him about a month after their own breakup. (they we’re together for only a week and a half) 

Now, two years later, she started acting different after meeting her girlfriend. As for me, I reconnected with an old friend (who i’ll call lily) and would often would hangout with her while Sarah was out with her girlfriend. I was also struggling with Blake again. It didn’t take long to see the difference in Sarah since it started off with little things like her refusing to let me go out and see anyone that wasn’t a woman and her saying that i should be looking for a girlfriend instead. At first i thought she was joking, but she was dead serious  and told me that i should be more like her.

When i finally brought it up, she would simply say that everything was okay. Of course, that was a lie because she would start to actively avoid me, leave me out of plans, and lie whenever i made plans. She even added me to a group call and proceeded to ‘call me out’ on everything that apparently bugged her. It was all very random. She explained her reasoning which varied from feeling left out between me and  Lily all the way to the fact that i was talking to Blake again. (which was weird since she didn’t care AT ALL when i got back together with him after their breakup)

Sarah was a very important person in my life. So, even after all the ultimatums she gave me to ‘fix the friendship’’, she still ignored and lied to me constantly. i cut off Lily and even Blake for good so that she would stay in my life . Nothing i did ever seemed good enough. This went on for weeks until she texted me a paragraph on why i was a terrible friend and that she was done. I ended up letting my temper get the best of me and accused her of trying to control every aspect of my life in order for her to be satisfied with me and our friendship, which led her to blocking me. I haven’t bothered to try and reach out since. ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-12,"AITA for accusing my best friend of trying to control my life?

20,1gptvjc,WIBTA for bringing up my malaise over my fiancé's family involvement?,"My fiance (28) is the eldest of three boys (25, 22). We organized a weekend with his two brothers and their two partners, as we have never spent time all 6 of us without other members of the family. My fiance and I drove up as the 4 of them all live in the same city. It was about a 6 hour drive for us each way, we were going to be there for 3 nights. 

Anyways, my fiance and I had some ideas for activities that we were going to suggest to BILs/SILs, pending everyone's schedule and interest. We booked tickets for a museum expo that was free (first sunday of the month) and tentatively looked at some restaurants. We're pretty easy going though and now that his brothers are quite late risers / so we didn't go in with anything too concrete.

Anyhow, we had a nice weekend, but I noticed that his BILs insisted on spending a decent portion of the weekend updating their parents on what we were up to. I was happy to jump on a call and say hi to them - we'd obviously told them we were going to be visiting his brothers - but I thought we'd only call once (maybe twice). I didn't realize that his brothers wanted to work our plans around when it was convenient for us to talk to their parents. We essentially changed our dinner reservations so that we could come home early, so that we could FT their parents.

My fiance was uncomfortable during this, as he did not see the need to call them so many times, but also when he did voice his opinion, his BILs and SILs all taunted him for not wanting to call.

It left me feeling quite uncomfortable. His parents asked for a pretty detailed, hour by hour account of what we got up to every day (we ended up calling them twice the first day and once the 2nd). I almost felt like we 'weren't allowed' to spend time with his BILs and SILs without his parents also in attendance, as they asked to be skyped in frequently. At no time did the parents say ""by all means go enjoy yourselves and we'll talk later""

This isn't the first instance of things happening which have left me questionning how much autonomy my fiance has.

Hi, this is my first post on reddit and since I'm making this post, this is really overwhelming me. I’m F(22) and currently in my third sabbatical year, looking for a job to save up and eventually move. I recently came back from living in France and have always wanted to work as a substitute teacher. I’ve applied multiple times but didn’t get in, so I’m working a temporary job with lawn mower robots, which is physically very hard for me.

My best friend (22M) works as a substitute teacher and has helped me with applications. However, he has mental health struggles (depression, ADD) that sometimes affect our friendship, mainly due to his difficulty with communication. For example, he often impulsively agrees to things but later changes his mind, leaving me feeling blamed for “pressuring” him when I didn’t realize he wasn’t actually okay with it.

Recently, he told me he wanted some space, and after we reconciled, he mentioned he gets frustrated with me for small things, like asking questions or clarifying plans, which he interprets as boundary-crossing. This has made me question myself a lot.

I got an interview for a substitute teaching job at his school, which I was thrilled about, as it’s been my dream job and has a great wage ($35/hour). I told him I applied, and he was supportive, but when I got the interview, he suddenly said he didn’t want to work with me and needed space. I was confused and hurt, especially since he helped me apply and said nothing earlier. After I explained my side, he said he still wanted a break and that it was up to me to attend the interview.

I ended up going and got the job offer, but now I’m conflicted. If I take it, I worry it could ruin our friendship, but if I don’t, I’ll regret it. Am I wrong for wanting to accept it?

25,1gpt2cm,AITA for not visiting my family anymore?,"So back story for context. I used to live 8+ hours away from my family and would always drive to my home state for family stuff aka everything lol get togethers ranging from birthdays, to Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, and any major holiday. This amounted to me visiting once a month because 8hours is a long drive. My parents would drive to see me and then me my partner and our kids about once every 6ish weeks so not quite once a month but more than every other month. All in all I’d say we saw each other about every other week. Once we started having more kids our visits dropped to holidays and I wouldn’t come back (everyone in tow) for birthdays for myself, parents, and siblings.

Well my mom has always had some beef idk what with my MIL. My MIL lived about 15 min away from where my partner and I bought a house at the beginning of our engagement. And in the 5 years we lived there LITERALLY only came to our place once! We always needed to go to her house. That’s fine it’s 15min and her home is very nice for hosting whatever. Well my mom was always saying how if we lived closer even if it was an hour away she’d be coming over to see our children every weekend etc etc about how she’s so sad she can’t give us date nights because we live so far away.

Fast forward to 2 years ago my partner tells me they have an opportunity for a transfer with promotion to my parents home city where I grew up! I was so excited. Finally we’d be having date nights, finally we’d have people that wanted our kids to be in their space and visit with us right?? Wrong. 

I’ll be the first to admit that the move was rough especially since I was on a bedrest pregnancy (as a surrogate for my sister I might add but that’s a whole other story). We also had to move to an area of the city’s suburbs I wasn’t too familiar with because of housing costs (remember 2 years ago when covid was ending and the market went - and stayed - bonkers?!) Well that was 30 min from my parents home. And my mom decided it was way too far for her to drive especially since her job requires her to be out of her home and my position went remote during covid and stayed remote so I can work from home so in her eyes I don’t really work because I’m home all the time.  She has not once been to our home except to pick my kids up to have “fun Grammy time” and then drop them back off later that same day all hyped up on sugar and no rules. 

Anything at all and it’s “okay when should I expect you at our house” I’m so tired of it. We have 4 kids our youngest is 2. My partner and I are fed up with all the expectations for visits and none of effort on coming out to see us. My family is very happy to see us just at their home on their terms. And I know my MIL was exactly like this but my mom made this huge deal about how amazing of a Grammy she was and would be even better if we lived closer but she’s actually worse. She never does anything she said she would do and I know I’m not entitled to her time babysitting or anything but she built up these expectations and NONE of it panned out.

26,1gpskzy,AITA for refusing an impossible demand from my fair-weather bio dad?,"PSA for any confusion: my bio father “Jane” transitioned when I was 15 and lives as a lesbian woman.

I (41M) grew up entirely with my single mother. Jane (77F, but a cisman at the time) was a CEO entrepreneur who met my mom because she was scraping by as one of his assembly line workers. Jane abandoned me after I was born because “taking care of a baby is impractical while running a business,” and my mother “already has another kid, so it makes more sense.” As I grew, Jane dropped in 1-2 times a year to take me on short trips to places she wanted to see. Then she would send my mom angry letters afterward about how improper it was that I sipped the milk directly from my cereal bowl and didn’t own “three levels of clothing” for different events. 

When I was 18, Jane got herself an absolutely wretched girlfriend who would later become her wife. “Lena” (67F)  is a trust fund baby who has never worked a real day in her life, and has three spoiled rotten children. For two decades, her relationship with Jane consisted of screaming fights, outrageous jealousy, possessiveness, vindictiveness, and hyper-controlling aggression marked by explosive public tantrums and verbal assaults on everyone else in Jane’s life. Many years ago in my early 30s, she publicly attacked me at Jane’s birthday dinner over a completely incorrect idea of why I parted ways with an ex-partner years earlier. She did this in front of my current partner, and demanded outrageous and intrusive details about my private life over it. I calmly told her it was none of her business, and I left. Amends were never made, because unsurprisingly, Lena never took responsibility for her outrageous behavior. 

A few years later, Jane finally divorced Lena, but in the aftermath, we never really got much closer because frankly, I don’t really trust Jane and she has never been there for me. She still only reaches out to me when it’s convenient for her, and shows zero reflection on how a lifetime of parental neglect affected me and complicated every part of the way I grew up and found a place in the world. 

Recently, Jane has decided not just to reconcile with Lena, but that they will soon remarry. She now wants me to accept and forgive all past “gripes and grievances” as she has, and become “one big happy family.” I have held my ground and refused to allow someone so unstable back into my life, and especially around my wife or children. To be honest, I am morally offended by Jane’s cluelessness, and in our last conversation, I lost my temper and told her off. How can someone who put in a <1% effort for 41 years now come around demanding the moon and stars from me? Her position is that if I don’t allow this toxic, volatile person back into my life, she will disinherit me. I told her to go fuck herself.

Last week, a relative reached out and asked me to go to therapy and reconcile. Her argument? The holidays are coming and it’s inconvenient that we are estranged. I’m at wits end here.

28,1gps4h8,AITA for deciding not to go home for Thanksgiving,"AITAH for deciding not to go home for Thanksgiving?

I (22M) recently came out to my parents as bisexual. This started when my boyfriend, let's call him EJ, invited me to go to a banquet with him. I had enough respect for my parents that I would ask if I could go to the banquet. They decided against it and told me that it was not wise spending, and the whole thing did not make sense. Mind you, I was not out, so I was referring to my boyfriend (EJ) as my friend to keep the peace. 

I started to think about my relationship and I decided, over the phone, that I was going to rip the band-aid off and just come out of the closet and confess to her that I was bisexual and that I had a boyfriend. I didn’t tell her who was the boyfriend. 

She was left speechless, to say the least. She said a he would stand firmly on the word of God and what I was doing was completely wrong and it was not me. My father claimed that mom was ready to give up saying she could not eat or sleep in any capacity. He said that she felt like I was defying her and everything she worked hard for.

The hopes of my dad accepting who I was were dashed within the first sentence. My dad explained to me that I was becoming or participating in an abomination. He took the Bible and threw multiple verses at me and ""evangelized"" to me.  Some things included insulting my friends and saying that I had not chosen my friends well, calling my therapist and friends yes-men and women, and saying he would decree and declare that I was a straight male. Some notable quotes include:

""God is mad at you.""

“We, as your parents, know you, and this is not you or who you are.”

""You have turned away from your parents and God.""

""God has literally turned his back to you.""

“You have been coached by these people into believing something that you are not.""

""You need to do some serious fasting, praying and repentance.""

“I don’t know why you’re acting like you are unloved.”

“You have become desperate.”

“You have lied on God saying that he put this on you.”

And so on…

He wanted to continue the conversation later, but I shut it down and said that I had heard his point very clearly and I was good. I needed my space to process what he said and I knew they needed as well.

However after all of that, I still feel like the asshole. This is will be their first Thanksgiving without me, and it feels like I am not making the right decision, given that it will be two bombshells:

1. Being Bi
2. Not coming home

I've had a really bad week, and was stressed because of an internship presentation, and as a jury i was assigned a professor specialized in my internship subject. 

We were in class when Ruby said: ""out of all of us you're the most cooked, imagine having professor's name when you'll be talking about his specialty"", it kept ringing inside my head causing me more stress, i didn't want to keep it inside my heart so I decided to tell her.

I went: ""Ruby, you know when you said that, it really hurt me and stressed me out"" her: ""what did i say"" me: ""the fact that I'm cooked you know I'm already stressed and it made me panic even more"" her stuttering that she didn't mean it that way, and tearing up, me shocked literally, her starting to sob, we couldn't talk freely since we were still in class, so i texted the other friend, asking her what the hell just happened, just to find her just as shocked from her reaction as me.

Billie has struggled with mental health issues for a while, and she’s not always great at reading social cues. Lately, Dani and I have been feeling a bit overwhelmed by her behavior. It started back at Halloween when she described in detail how she and her ex had been planning to have a baby, and then shared some very personal, triggering details about how their relationship ended. It felt like she was trauma dumping. Dani and I even ended up apologizing to some new people we’d just met at the party for the uncomfortable conversation.

At that same party, I’d invited the guy I’m seeing. By the end, it was just the three of us—me, Billie, and him. As a joke, I asked Billie to share what she thought was my biggest “red flag.” Instead, she revealed several of my secrets right in front of him. I was so embarrassed. Another time, we were out for coffee, and I mentioned that this guy had asked me to go to the movies. Billie suddenly started loudly saying that I couldn’t watch a certain movie with him because she was “my girlfriend” and it was “our movie.” Although we sometimes joke about being “girlfriends,” she takes it too far and too often. It honestly makes me uncomfortable.

This past weekend, Billie started acting strangely in our group chat. She said she’d be going offline for a few days and told Dani and me to “take care of ourselves.” Knowing her mental health struggles, we were worried, but in the end, she was fine. It was stressful, though.

Then, Billie mentioned she wanted us to go see a play with her. I told her I’d check my schedule because I was pretty sure I already had plans with other friends. Dani said she was considering booking a doctor’s appointment that day since it was her only free day. So, we didn’t confirm we’d go, but we didn’t outright say no either. This was on Saturday. Then on Monday, Billie told us she’d gone ahead and bought the tickets. But Dani had already scheduled her appointment, and I’d confirmed my plans.

Now, Billie’s asking us to pay her back for the tickets. The problem is, we never actually committed to going, and she knew we might be busy that day. I’d understand paying her back if I’d agreed to go and then had to cancel, but I didn’t say yes in the first place.

Our father passed away when I was 12, and despite being the eldest, my brother never stepped up to help the family. While my siblings drifted through life without taking responsibilities, I focused on my education and became financially independent.

Since childhood, my brother has struggled with gaming addiction, even stealing and lying to fund this habit. Despite this, I've supported him and my family extensively - managing my elder sister's wedding, her child's surgery, yearly home renovations, and even basic necessities like phones and mobile recharges for my siblings. I've done this while maintaining my financial independence, never taking money from family since starting my career.

Recently, we secured him a position at a local government office. He needed a computer but didn't want to take his gaming rig (which I had also helped him build). I gave him my personal laptop from my university days. I worked small gigs as a student to pay off for the laptop. Instead of appreciation, he immediately asked for a new battery as a replacement and laptop bag for him. I had just bought him an expensive graphics card that he had requested.

I'm currently home and noticed him on the laptop all day. Thinking he was working from home, I checked on him only to find him gaming with friends. This was especially frustrating since I had just bought him new clothes for work and am already committed to funding his upcoming wedding.
Fed up with his lack of responsibility, I have taken my laptop back and blocked his number.

I don't know what to do. A part of me wants to leave everything behind and never look back. But another part wants to work even harder so that I can earn more and continue to help them.

P.S. Apologies for the essay. This post was more to get it off of my chest than anything else.

32,1gprgrh,AITA for declining an invitation my a family member's anniversary party,"I (33F) am part of a larger family, and we celebrate pretty much every holiday together. Birthdays are minimal celebrations. And that's about it. 

My aunt, Jeanie, (47F) and uncle, Richard, (51M) were coming up on 10 years of marriage around the spring of this year (March-April). In February, we had a family gathering for a birthday party at my grandmother's house. I think it is safe to say that my grandmother's children (Jeanie and her 3 sisters) are extremely toxic around each other. They are always trying to divide and conquer with each other or get my grandmother on one or two of their sides and convince her the others are wrong.  
  
Now, during the timing of this birthday party, the youngest of the 4 sisters, Rachel (46F) and Jeanie were close (it changes daily). By close I mean talking/texting every day, spending time at each other's houses etc. Because Rachel and Jeanie were close during this time, they isolated themselves away from their other two sisters. So, at this birthday party, I was cleaning up and in the kitchen and there was a group of people in the den area and a group of people in the living room area. The kitchen ends up right in the middle of both of these areas so I was able to hear conversations from both groups. I wasn't eavesdropping everyone is just loud.  
  
So as I'm in the kitchen, I see Rachel walk from the den area into the living room area and tell her two other sisters (in a loud whisper tone) ""I'm throwing an anniversary party for Jeanie and Richard. Are you going to be there?"" Sister 1, Lucy, responded ""I'll be out town of the weekend of the 10th; when is it?"" Rachel proceeds to say ""You're seriously not going to move your trip. Wow."" Then she walked out back into the den area. 

Rachel then decides to tell Jeanie ""I was going to throw you a surprise anniversary party, but Lucy said she isn't going to move her trip so she isn't coming."" 

Here's where I come in...I walked into the den area and said ""wait, what is going on?"" and Rachel says ""I am throwing an anniversary party for Jeanie the weekend of the 10th."" I responded with ""that's in two weeks; I might need a little more notice than that if I'm going to be able to make it."" 

Things blew up! Jeanie got upset that no one wanted to celebrate her (when she explicitly stated previously she and Richard did not want an anniversary party) to the point that she stopped speaking to many of us for quite a few weeks. Rachel got upset that no one was excited she was throwing this party - which didn't make sense to me because when I asked what the party plans were...she didn't have any yet; ""they're still being finalized."" Lucy was upset that Rachel lied about her response. 

And all of them were upset at me because I said two weeks notice wasn't enough time for me to change the plans I already had for that weekend. So AITA for commenting that I wasn't sure if I could make it and invitations for this party probably should have been sent out weeks prior?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-12,"AITA for declining an invitation my a family member's anniversary party I (33F) am part of a larger family, and we celebrate pretty much every holiday together.

When I was younger, people told me i was lazy and didn’t care for school, which is kind of weird considering I‘m really ambitious and have always been a good kid and overachiever. Last year, I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to being severely depressed. My grades but also my social life and school life have been suffering for almost 3 1/2 years at that point which caused me to develop an intense fear of school. When I was discharged I struggled to find my way into everyday life again, including school. In 10. grade I missed more days of school then i could count because of my mental health issues. Now to present day. I changed schools this summer because i didn’t feel comfortable at my old school and didn’t get along with the teachers. Now, for some context. I still have a severe depression and have also been diagnosed with ADHD and panic disorder which only makes my state worse. I have weird ups and downs that cause me to either be in kind of mental heaven or a mental graveyard. In addition my physical health has been really bad for some reason which caused me to be sick non stop the last few weeks. Today i had a really bad day and as a result of that i got a panic attack. I couldn’t take 3 hours more of school so I went to the office to get an exemption. When I was there my school principal started yelling at me, telling me i can‘t go on skipping class, that i would fail the year, that the teachers are mad at me cause i was sick so much and that i can‘t keep going like last year (he knew that i missed a lot of school). On top of that he threatened to require medical certificates if i keep missing out. I tried to defend myself but couldn’t get a word out.

36,1gpqntd,WIBTA if I moved out of my mum's house and went to live with my dad?,"I (17M) live with my mum since my parents' divorce in March, and I see my dad every other weekend more or less. Thing is, recently, any time my mum and I argue or disagree on something recently, she threatens to kick me out and send me to live at my dad's, which is a one bedroom apartment (that is actually just a renovated garage).

For context, I have depression and find it hard to get motivation to do anything at all, let alone clean, but I've been slowly forcing myself to do things to make myself feel better, and recently I cleaned out a different cupboard which brought my mums attention to the rest of my room. Today  I came home from school to find all my clothes in a pile on the floor at my door, blocking it so I was barely able to get in. She's been pestering me about cleaning everything and has demanded that I clean a cupboard a day, which I told her I could try to do but cant guarantee as I have other things to be doing that I prioritise over cleaning (A-Levels are a pain). I guess she decided to take matters into her own hands and essentially force me into cleaning it? I just shoved everything back in because that's not something I'm dealing with today, then went to the kitchen to heat food.

My mum then comes into the kitchen and starts talking about how she knows I saw what she did in my room, and that if it's not cleaned today she's throwing all of it out. I told her to not touch my things, and that if she wants it done then she has to let me do it in my own time not exactly when she decides. She then starts yelling at me, calling me disrespectful and that she decides how things run in the house, not me. She went off somewhere then came back and this time said that if its not cleaned its all getting thrown out and that I'll be moving in with my dad into a garage, to which I told her fine, I'll go live with him but I don't want to hear anything from her if I do. She now says I'm an AH for threatening her and putting my dad above her, which ????. Idk it seems like a situation completely blown out of proportion and unnecessary but WIBTA if I went through with it and just went to live with my dad?

  
edit: just wanna clear up a few things

1. from the comments im reading I think a lot of people are assuming its just a few small cupboards that would take like 5 minutes to clean- when I cleaned the one wardrobe ive done, it took around 2 hours and that was the simplest one to clean. a lot of the cupboards in my room are also packed with my mums belongings rather than mine because she had no space for them

37,1gpqgth,AITA for yelling at some boys at a nude beach?,"Throwaway. Ok this is just the craziest thing.

I've (31F) never been to a nude beach of course but there is a pretty famous one in our area very Southern California that is well known and ""CLOTHING OPTIONAL"" safe family friendly etc not skeezy supposedly so when a girl friend wanted to go I said what the hell and went along.

Well we went and found a place we found a spot that was not too crowded and put our stuff down and got comfortable and I took my top off and so did my friend it was a beautiful day.

Not long after we were there this gaggle of teenage boys came along (maybe 18m 15m 14m just a guess) there were three of them I'd say one was maybe college age and the other two were younger like mid teens maybe, i think they were probably brothers maybe, and they set up camp right next to us. They were probably maybe 15 feet away. They had board shorts on but also had lots of stuff towels and gym bags and a cooler and boogie boards so they were obviously going to stay a while :(  Well after a few minutes they all stood up and DROPPED THIER SHORTS right there and ran down to the water totally stark naked. And then later they were running around and horseplaying and going up and talking to people probably flirting and throwing a nerf football all sometimes almost right in front of us. Once their ball even landed over right by us and one of the younger boys actually walked RIGHT UP and said Sorry m'am he walked right up just as naked as the day he was born like it was nothing. I was stunned of course but said nothing.

Later it almost happened again and I yelled not in a loud voice Could you guys move a little. And they didn't say anything but they gathered up their things and moved over a bit. The beach was medium crowded that day but there was still plenty of room and it was no problem for them to move. We left the beach pretty quick after that.

My friend said I was an asshole for even saying anything but I think the boys were assholes for encrouching on our space and making us uncomfortable.

  
UPDATE EDIT

Ok apparently I'm an asshole. Nudity doesn't bother me one bit and I expected to see it from adults at a nude beach. I just wasn't expecting to see literal teenage BOYS strutting around stark naked like it was absolutely nothing and right in front of us. And no I did not make a close study of their penis as some one suggested but when a guy/man/boy is walking around around you completely and totally nude it is impossible not to look. And no to the DM I cannot say exactly how they were manscaped whatever that precisely means. And in response to DMs no I did not personally find the boys attractive nor was I offended that they did not ""hit on"" me, yes they were very good looking young men and I'm sure plenty of girls their age would be all over them but I like mature men so no thank you. I'm also not sure what one DM meant by ""swinging hammer"" but no one was swinging anything extraordinarily and no one was being inappropriate, I guess I do have to admit that the boys were actually nice and polite kids, I just found the situation inappropriate and unsettling. When you see the type of boys that you'd expect to see in the mall or the skate park but suddenly they are completely in their birthday suits it is jarring. Thanks.

38,1gpq14y,AITA for calling my parents trash?,"I’m 16 and I have always been aware of how my half siblings treated me. It’s like they just hated me and my mom for no reason. I found out my Brother Cory was getting married and once again my dad (his father) wasn’t invited. I know it hurts my dad’s feelings. I reached out to Cory so I could understand why this is going on. 

Cory told me I was an affair baby and his parents was married up until I came along. It caused his parents divorce when he was 10. It broke his mom’s heart and he doesn’t speak to his dad for it.

I confronted my parents because there’s such a disgusting age gap and class gap between my mom’s family and my dad’s. My mom doesn’t know how to act and takes everything so offensive and says anything is disrespectful and complains about my dad’s mom (my grandma) and she treats her. 

The conversation became an argument where I called my parents trash for everything and I don’t have a sense of family because of them. My grandmother on my mom’s side is a mentally ill druggie like most of my mom’s family and I don’t feel loved by my dad’s side at all. 

I told my parents it’s all their fault and I wish I wasn’t born. My mom is pissed and tried banning me from social media where I talked to my half brother and shut off the wifi forgetting my phone has a hot spot.

39,1gpq0q8,AITA for refusing to leave a wedding because I wore a dress that looks white under a black light?,"A few months ago I attended a close friend’s wedding with my husband. I wore a YELLOW dress. Think like Belle in Beauty of the beast yellow. Bumble bee yellow. So yellow that I did not question if it was appropriate or not to wear to a wedding and neither did my friends nor family. 

I arrive at the wedding, we have the ceremony, the cocktail hour, the dinner and the reception. I get many compliments on the dress and the bride even comments on how much she loves it several times. 

Towards the end of the reception the venue dimmed the lights and turned on some blacklights. These blacklights made my dress appear more white than yellow. 

A member of the wedding party approached me while the blacklights were on and stated that I needed to leave because my dress was “white” and “inappropriate.” I stated that the dress was yellow but the blacklights were making it appear white. The member of the wedding party stated that if i didn’t leave she would “make me.” I stated I’m here to celebrate my friend, repeated that the dress was yellow and said I will not be leaving early (bride and groom hadn’t left yet and I came from overseas). The conversation while heated, did not have raised voices or foul language from either side. But I will say it was tense. 

The wedding party member walked off and I watched as they immediately went to talk to the groom, angrily pointing in my direction. The groom shrugged and continued to dance.

The next morning I was approached by a different friend at breakfast (not in the wedding party) who stated that they heard what happened and that I should have left when asked because it made people “uncomfortable” and that I made it about me “partying” rather than “respecting wedding etiquette.”

I have felt incredibly embarrassed about this since….so am I the asshole for not leaving the wedding when asked? 

TLDR: Wore yellow dress that looked white under black lights. Was asked to leave by a member of the wedding party. Didn’t leave. Told I made others uncomfortable by a friend the next day.

40,1gppwt0,AITA for ‘stealing’ my neighbour’s cat,"Last year November, I (23F) moved back home after finishing university. For context, I live in a small gated community. Shortly after moving back, I noticed a cat hanging around my yard. She had a mangy coat, was quite dirty and really skinny so I assumed she was a stray - we have lots of strays in the area so this isn’t an unreasonable assumption (especially given her appearance). I slowly started spending more time with her, trying to get her used to me. And I would feed her. She started getting used to me and began coming inside the house. She would spend her days inside my room, and often leave at night. Around January, she started sleeping in my room too. 

Fast forward to March, my dad gets a message from one of our neighbours asking if we’ve seen their cat. He sends us a picture, lo and behold, it’s the cat that I ‘rescued’. I was incredibly confused because she had been living with me for about 2 months at this point. However, I was happy that she had a home because I was going away for a few months and wouldn’t be able to look after her. 

I got back home in June, and the day I got back she showed up at my door. I was so excited because I had missed her. I got a job working from home, so I’m at home almost every day. I stopped feeding her because I knew she had a family to go back to so she’d spend her day with me (while they were at work and school) and then typically go home in the evenings to get food. This carried on for a few more months. Eventually she stopped going home entirely - I tried to encourage her to go home by not feeding her and working in coffee shops so that she couldn’t see me. But it didn’t work, she’d wait around for me and stay with me even if I wasn’t feeding her. Eventually I had to start feeding her again because she wasn’t going home to eat, despite my best efforts to try to get her to go home. 

She now basically lives with me, except when I’m not here then she goes ‘home’. My neighbour is constantly asking if she’s here. He has 2 young children that miss her (which is understandable) and I will take her to their house whenever he asks. It’s almost been a year that she’s been visiting me and a couple months that she’s been living with me. There’s a lot of tension between my dad and neighbour, and even some of the other neighbours have started giving their input. It’s a terribly awkward situation and I understand that I’m in the wrong but I also can’t help that she chooses me over them. And it doesn’t seem fair to her for me to just stop caring for her.

41,1gppstj,AITA For Going Off On My Brother Who Planned Dinner For the Family and Taking Us to an Out of Budget Restaurant  ,"My brother planned dinner for the family because we haven’t seen each other in some weeks so we wanted a day to get together. There was no special occasion, my younger brother had been sick the week off but we all wanted to get together to make sure he was okay.

My older brother planned a dinner day for us and found the restaurant he wanted to go to. Before hand he called and asked if a $30 hibachi plate was okay. I was fine with a $30 plate because that’s usually what places are running now a days. He didn’t send where we were going until 10 minutes before it was time to meet up. When we arrived at the restaurant it seemed nicer than I expected. He told the hostess we wanted to wait for one of the chef shows. I asked for the menu and found that the cheapest option on the menu was a $37 veggie plate with increased prices to add a meat. Every option averaged $55+. 

Am I the asshole for bringing the menu to my brother and telling him “I’m tired of your bullshitting so you can get what you want. This place is too expensive for what I was told.” We left the restaurant and got in an argument about how he spent a lot of time planning where we were going to eat. That he will not be called a liar when he “told me plates average $30-$45” (on the phone he told me $30). And then stormed off causing the family to not have dinner.

44,1gpp8js,AITA for telling my friend he should move out?,"So, I (27M) let my best friend (27M) move in with me about a year ago when he lost his job and had nowhere to go. Rent where we live is crazy high, and I know he had a really rough time—he went through a bad breakup and was pretty depressed, so I told him he could stay with me to get back on his feet.

For the first few months, he was really down and didn’t go out much. I could tell he was grateful and wanted to help, but he just wasn’t in a good place mentally. I tried to support him however I could, like covering most of the groceries and bills since he couldn’t. I didn’t want him to stress, and he did what he could to help around the place, like cleaning and cooking sometimes.

Four months ago, he finally got a job again, and things started to look up for him. He’s been slowly getting better and more social, which makes me happy because he’s like a brother to me. But at the same time, he’s still not really contributing to bills or rent, and when I ask, he says he’s “saving up to move out eventually.” I understand he’s still trying to rebuild, but it’s been a while now, and he never really gives me a clear timeline.

I’m feeling a bit torn because I miss having my own space, but I know he’s been through a lot. When I gently brought up that maybe it’s time for him to start looking for a place of his own, he got really quiet and said he still needs some time to save. He told me he’s afraid of going back to square one and doesn’t want to risk taking on more than he can handle too soon.

Since then, things have felt tense between us. He seems hurt, and he’s avoiding me more, which makes me feel like I’ve messed up. A couple of our friends said I should be more patient and understanding given what he’s been through. I feel bad and wonder if I’m being selfish by wanting him to move out, especially knowing how hard the past year was for him. I just don’t know how to balance helping him with needing my own space.

Edit:

Thank you all so much for the comments and advice! I didn’t expect this many responses, but I appreciate it. Honestly, making this post was partly to push myself to finally have this talk, and maybe even to show my friend or some of our other friends if I needed extra support. It's easy to just ignore a problem when it’s awkward to deal with, but I knew it was time to take action.

A lot of people pointed fingers at my friend, calling him a leech, and while I understand where that’s coming from, he’s genuinely a good guy who's just had a rough year. I still care about him and want to support him, but I also need a bit more space and fairness for myself. I’m not drowning financially since I make more than him, but it’s still not easy to keep covering most of the bills alone.

I’ve decided to sit him down and have a serious talk. I’ll ask him to start gradually covering more of the rent, groceries and utilities, aiming to reach half over the next two months so it’s not too sudden. I’ll also do my best to help him find a more affordable place to live, so he can work toward moving out on his own.

45,1gpp57n,AITA for using my friend for money?,"I (23F) am currently editing a friends (I’ll call him Peter (20M) YouTube videos and have done so for a few months. The pay is shit to put it lightly but enough for the things I have to pay. 

We have been friends since 2022 and it started out great. The problem is the more we talk, the more toxic he seems to be.

Before he paid me, I did edit some videos for free. I like editing which is why he asked me in the first place. But at some point he had recorded a six-seven hour long video and one of our friends (I’ll call her Julia (19F) found out about it and she “yelled” at Peter for not paying me. She didn’t yell, but he claimed she did. 

All Julia said is that if Peter is asking me “to edit a six hour long video she better be getting paid” and all he said was that he didn’t need to be getting yelled at and soon after left without saying anything. After a few hours he did text me and we came up with the current payment.

Another thing he did that really got my blood boiling was when another friend (I’ll call him Dan (22M) bought me things from a website called Throne. He bought me a few mangas and Peter got pissed. Dan had helped two other people with paying for stuff but those people were getting help with necessities such as food. Peter claimed that Dan shouldn’t be using his money on people that are “stable” and should spend his money on the people that need it, but it’s also his money and he can do what he wants. Might add that we are talking about 50-60$ and not hundreds of dollars for the mangas he bought me. When I said that Dan bought me the books ‘cause he wanted me too have a reason to smile Peter answered by saying “You have other reasons to smile tho” which, fair it’s true but still feels weird.

After awhile Peter was told by Dan that his throne was simply too unorganized so he would never buy anything of it. What did Peter do? Organized his throne and told Dan “to have a field day” so all of a sudden Dan can spend his money on things people do not need. It was clear that Peter was just jealous even tho he had gotten things from throne by another person, one of the people Dan needed to help with money for food.

46,1gporaj,WIBTA if I ask my in-laws to stop questionning my husband's dietary restriction?,"My (28M) husband and I (26F) have been married a little under a year. We've been together since college. I grew up in a pescetarian household, and have maintained those eating habits for myself as an adult. My husband was brought up eating meat, but told me he's always had qualms about it himself, and 'tested out' being vegetarian for some time when we was a young adult. Even though he was not a pescetarian when he and I started dating (at 20) he is now fully pescetarian (and even stronger in his conviction than me!). It's been 5 or so years that he is fully pescetarian.

His family (extended and immediate) knows this, and we've spent many family meals/holidays together. What irks me is that every time we are at his parents, they still offer him meat, and act surprised when he doesn't have any. He's explained to them ""I don't eat meat anymore"" multiple times, but it keeps re-occuring. His parents are very young so I doubt this is a memory issue.

My (28M) husband and I (26F) have been married a little under a year. We've been together since college. I grew up in a pescetarian household, and have maintained those eating habits for myself as an adult. My husband was brought up eating meat, but told me he's always had qualms about it himself, and 'tested out' being vegetarian for some time when we was a young adult. Even though he was not a pescetarian when he and I started dating (at 20) he is now fully pescetarian (and even stronger in his conviction than me!). It's been 5 or so years that he is fully pescetarian.

His family (extended and immediate) knows this, and we've spent many family meals/holidays together. What irks me is that every time we are at his parents, they still offer him meat, and act surprised when he doesn't have any. He's explained to them ""I don't eat meat anymore"" multiple times, but it keeps re-occuring. His parents are very young so I doubt this is a memory issue.

48,1gpn1fm,UPDATE: AITA for telling my Dad I don’t care if he’s present at my wedding? ,"Firstly; Thank you all so very much! The overwhelming amount of advice, support, feedback and kind words meant more than you could ever know. 

In case anybody is confused, here’s my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/P5YYpJ4Wim


So,

My wedding was just over a week ago, and it was absolutely perfect. It was me and J surrounded by the people we love and the ones who love us most.

Neither my Dad or E were there.

Following our last talk where I told him I didn’t care if he was present, it was complete silence from him for just over a month. I took my Dad’s silence as his mind made up, and I actually felt at ease with it, which was another huge wake-up call. 

He finally messaged me in October and asked to talk over the phone. I told J and he said to do it and use the opportunity to make my final choice on the matter, and set it in stone. 

So we spoke. He asked that I allow E at the wedding; I said no. He said that he wouldn’t come if she wasn’t there, I said I didn’t care. We went back and forth for a little bit, mostly just repeating ourselves, until he basically said “Is this really the hill you want to die on?”

I said yes, told him that he had a week to give me a simple yes or no as to whether he would be there, and hung up. 

He messaged me a couple of days later with a looooong paragraph about how I was giving him ultimatums, making him choose, holding onto the past, petty and disrespectful, etc… And something snapped. I said that he had more than enough chances to attempt to make things right but that I was done, and blocked him. 

On the day of my wedding, I tried not to think about it and it was honestly easier than I thought, to the point I didn’t realise he wasn’t there until midway through the ceremony. 

I was hearing from mutual friends and family that my Dad has been pretty silent on the whole thing. Other members of my family/close friends were present at the wedding and asked why my Dad wasn’t there, and I just told them it was a story for another day (Not something I wanted to get into on my wedding).

Honestly, this entire situation is just draining. I’ve known for a long time that it would end in flames at some point or another, and I’m not entirely sure why I held out that little bit of hope for so long. I genuinely feel at peace for the first time in years, and relieved that I no longer have to deal with him or E.

I’m in bed with my now-husband writing this post, and feeling better than ever. I’ve realised I gave him too much of my time and patience when he didn’t deserve it. This toxic chapter of my life is done. 

I’m more in love with my childhood sweetheart than I thought was possible and can’t stop grinning at the fact I get to call him my husband! Again, thank you so very much for of the responses! You’re all a lot wiser than I am! Have a great day, everyone. ❤️",UPDATE,2024-11-12,"UPDATE: AITA for telling my Dad I don’t care if he’s present at my wedding?  Firstly; Thank you all so very much!

49,1gpmt6i,AITA? Woman threatens to call police on me for asking questions in the laundry room,"So I live in Finland at a student apartment complex. I had done some laundry the day before, and was going to pick them up from the drying room. There was this older woman doing her laundry. What caught my eye was that she had a green water hose going from the laundry room's seperate water tap into the laundry machine's hatch/hole where you put the detergents.

I had not seen that kind of water hose setup before, so I was curious. I asked about it, and if the water pipes that normally supply the water to the machine had gone dry. She said in pretty good Finnish that she didn't understand the question. I presume she didn't know the word for water hose (*vesiletku*), so I repeated the question, this time pointing to the hose and pipes. She asked if I spoke any Russian. I didn't, but I had access to Google Translate.

As I was writing, she told me to ""stop bullying her"", which I first took as humorous banter between neighbours. I showed her the translation, but she *refused* to look at it, again repeating that I should stop bullying her, and that I should back off. Confused, I asked what she meant, but she took her own phone, began filming me, and said that if I would not stop ""bullying"" her she would send the video to the police (!?).

As she refused to even listen to my explanations, I stopped trying. I still had my dry laundry in the adjacent drying room, so what followed was kind of awkward 5 minutes as I folded my clothes up and she kept sitting on the laundry room bench. The threat to call the cops on me seemed very uncalled for, so I wanted to try one more time to set the record straigth. So I wrote a little ""sorry about that, I was just curious about the hose"" paragraph to explain and de-escalate the situation. She again refused to look at my phone, and said very rudely that she didn't want to talk to me nor see me. 

All our communication was in Finnish, as she refused to look at my attempted Russian translations.

Idk if I did anything wrong, but here are my theories to what might have gone wrong on my part:

* She said that she had reserved the laundry room, and took my presence as barging in. (However, the reservations are for the laundry machines, and I was picking up my dried up laundry. I had every right to be there)
* She took my (20-ish male) casual talking to her (35-45 yr woman) as some sort of sexual harrasment?
* She took my male presence as threatening? When I brought my phone closer to her face that she could read the translations, that's when she told me to back off. However, I was keeping the polite-distance-with-strangers the whole time.
* Russo-Finnish mistranslation? Although she spoke Finnish very well, she clearly didn't know some words.
* Cultural difference in something?

I had acted calm and casual (though increasingly confused) during the whole situation, but thought it was both very unwarranted and rude as fuck by the woman to begin filming me and threatening to call the cops on me.

50,1gplx2l,AITA My wife(24F) proposed a fasting diet and then wanted to change it to a different one,"So around 3 months ago, my wife proposed we do a fasting diet. I(24M) think she called it a dirty fast? We fast (or stay under (500 calories) on MWF and only eat on TTh and weekends. We did that for about a month and we actually lost some weight.

Unfortunately, at the end of that month, my wife’s mother needed hip replacement surgery so we talked and decided to pause the fasting because I didn’t want my wife to be hungry on top of all the stress of taking care of her mother. The fast was paused for about 1-1 1/2 months and started back up recently. We go through a week of fasting and my wife wants to change to a diet that removes sugar. 

I really like this fasting because we were actually losing weight. But I feel kinda bad that I didn’t want to change to something else. Should I have? Ever since we started back up, it feels like her heart hasn’t been in it. And usually, it me that isn’t into whatever it is but I really like this fasting we are doing. 

Was I a jerk for not wanting to try a different diet? I feel bad that I told her i’d like to stick with this one if we can.

If you have more questions, let me know and I’ll try to answer them. 

Edit: Yes, I understand that my wife and I could do two separate diet plans but we aren’t great at sticking to stuff like that unless we have someone to help keep us on track. We are that for each other. Also, I asked my wife this and she said she’d feel bad for being able to eat when I couldn’t.

51,1gpl4fs,AITA for deleting my parents comments off my fb posts? ,"Hello & good morning. I (f36) have had a strained relationship with my parents for a long time. I was raised by two emotionally manipulative parents who made me grow up too fast. They weren’t very kind to me nor affectionate. There’s  so much more but you get the point, they weren’t good parents. 
I went low to nearly no contact with them once I moved out at age 18. I even moved to a different state, they complained about my lack of communication for so long and I never really cared. That was until I had children and they grew old enough to understand they had grandparents and aunts/uncles and would ask me when they could meet them. 

A little over a year ago I drove out to their state for thanksgiving and my children were happy to meet all of the family. It was nice but that’s as far as it went with me, I was at least happy that my parents were kind and caring towards my kids. They tried being sweet and affectionate with me but I wasn’t having it and would walk away or not respond to their affection which would visibly upset them. I decided to add my parents on Facebook after the trip to include them more in the my children’s life and tag them on the vacation photos etc. But that’s where the issues started. 


I post not only about my kids but about me and my personal life (new relationship after being divorced for a long time, me out with friends etc) and on every single post both my parents comment the most outlandishly weird and affectionate messages to me along the lines of “we love you so much sweetie”, “you mean the world to us” etc. with shit ton of stickers.

52,1gpktx6,AITA for not giving my friend feedback on a job they reffered me to,"We haven't known each other for long. We both worked at a company remotely. The company was horrible so we both decided to leave. I found another gig and left. They are still at the company. We share jobs regularly to help each other with job hunting. One of the jobs they shared with me, scheduled both of us for an interview.

See, when I share jobs with this friend or anyone else for that matter, I never follow up or check if they have applied or not. I think checking would be acting like someone's parent. It borders on invasion of privacy in a way. I'd only check if necessary. But when this particular friend shares something, they constantly check on me. Did I apply? Did I click on the link? Did I do this or that? I used to respond because I was grateful and thought they asked because they cared. But as of the latest, they sent three messages asking if got the interview. They told me they got one and then proceeded to ask if I got one. They have a way of asking that feels more like a demand instead of a request. Personally I'd never ask anybody this question. Hell, I'd never even check if they applied or not. That is their business, not mine. No one else ever checks on me if they refer me to something, understandably so.

Their behavior is starting to feel overbearing and I have ignored their last three messages asking if I got the interview or not. Normally I would tell someone that I'd appreciate it if they don't ask such questions but this friend can be stubborn so the prospect of that discussion seems unpleasant to me.

If I get the job I will most definitely let them know and thank them. But I don't see the point of keeping them updated about every minor detail.

I was sitting in a Paris metro car, and two guys came onboard: the first with an accordion, and the second with a microphone and speaker. The second guy had the speaker and the microphone, and was standing next to me. 

The speaker was pretty loud, and the guy with the microphone was 25% hypeman/75% rapping in French. I don't like people imposing music on me, so in a VERY bold move, I turned off the speaker's power button. I had a short conversation with the microphone guy that went like this (in French):
Rapper: Why did you turn it off?
Me: Because no one wants to hear your music here.
Group of guys 20 feet away: Hey, you were feeling it man; we liked it!
Rapper: Yeah, you liked it?

The Rapper, Accordion Guy and I exchanged glances as we arrived to the next stop. The two of them got off, and no one said anything afterwards. I was on the metro for another five stops.

My question to you: was I the asshole in this situation? I'm leaning towards yes, but at the same time, I don't like when people perform on public transportion, and I feel I'm being held hostage.

P.S. I actually like street performers and donate to them when they're good, but I'm very much against people busking in places where you're trapped together. Also, I probably would not have done this NYC, for example, because there would be a much higher chance for a physical confrontation. ",Everyone Sucks,2024-11-12,"AITA for turning off a performer's speaker in a Paris metro? Hello there,

I was sitting in a Paris metro car, and two guys came onboard: the first with an accordion, and the second with a microphone and speaker. The second guy had the speaker and the microphone, and was standing next to me. 

The speaker was pretty loud, and the guy with the microphone was 25% hypeman/75% rapping in French. I don't like people imposing music on me, so in a VERY bold move, I turned off the speaker's power button. I had a short conversation with the microphone guy that went like this (in French):
Rapper: Why did you turn it off?
Me: Because no one wants to hear your music here.

To give context, my fiancée and I  suffered a miscarriage about 18 months ago. A lot of people around us have been getting pregnant and having babies in the meantime, which has been incredibly hard to digest and we always question why can others have this happiness that we can't seem to get.

59,1gpii92,AITA for not doing everything to help my parents afford treatments for my brother?,"When my brother (18m) was 4 and I (16m) was 2 he was diagnosed with a blood cancer. He'd been sick for a little while and our parents thought he had a flu or something so they didn't get him all the help right away and because of that guilt they devoted every second to him from that point forward. It was supposed to be until he was cancer free. But by the time he was, we were 8 and 6 and they had become so used to focusing on him alone. I spent most of my time with an uncle who lived nearby or neighbors when he was undergoing treatment. My uncle didn't like having me nearby and the neighbors were so busy with their own kids that I got pretty used to being ignored and forgotten. So when my brother was back home and I wasn't sent anywhere anymore I was more used to being alone somewhere and taking care of myself.

My relationship with my parents was never a close one and it's the same with my brother. Both of us feel more like only kids and he gave me shit before for telling our parents I'd like some of their attention too. They'd always tell me he needed it more and he considered me a drama queen. The last time I said anything which was like 3 years ago, he said he didn't realize boys could be as dramatic as girls.

My brother's cancer come back 5 years ago and it was dealt with early and he didn't have treatment for very long and after that he seemed better in all ways. He had more energy, appetite was better and he was doing stuff he'd never had the energy to do before. 

About a year ago my mom's parents moved closer to us and they spent time focused on me which bonded me to them pretty quickly. I spend a lot of time with them now. I also took my focus totally off my parents and wanting their attention.

In July my brother's cancer returned again but it's different this time. I wasn't given much info. Treatments are complicated I guess and some other countries have treatments we're not focused on yet so there's talk of him going to Germany and I think Switzerland (but I could be wrong since I don't get much info). My parents are working more hours to help pay for this. And since then I spend even more time with my grandparents. Sometimes spending the night with them. My lack of presence wasn't noticed until they wanted me to help raise the money and maybe offer to get tested if that's what's needed. They said I could start fundraisers and get a job. I already have one but my parents never noticed.

I told them I wasn't going to help with that and it was for the three of them to figure it out. I got yelled at and my grandparents stepped in and said I wasn't responsible for this. My parents were saying it was helping family, my own brother and how could I consider not doing everything to help.

Paige had taken really unwell, and sheila stayed with her in the hospital. so she was gonna miss the first part of my birthday while catching up on sleep. i was bummed, but felt i couldnt express it because i would be made out to be selfish for acting out when someones taking ill. so i just agreed and got ready to see the rest of my friends.

we all met up, and someone asked me where sheila was , as she was my best friend and people found it weird she wasnt there yet.

I pushed it to the back of my mind, and enjoyed my time with the people who showed up for me, and i got a text near the end of the evening saying Sheila had just woke up and wouldnt be joining at all. all while Paige was posting on instagram that she herself, was on a night out (which i cant imagine someone just out of hospital would or should be doing). i decided to bring up what i was told to sheila, and she was LIVID. i was called a bad friend, how dare i call her a liar, i was selfish, and that she would be talking to me about this when i wasnt ""with a bunch of fucking gossips"" , AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-12,"AITA for questioning my friends whereabouts?

One of my best friends, lets call her sheila, planned with me to come over in the morning, get ready together, and then sleepover that night - make a full day of it so i wasnt alone. 

on the run up to the night of, things then started being mentioned, for example , she decided she wasnt gonna get ready at mine anymore as she wanted to stay with her bf the night before and would just get ready there, as she wouldnt see him on the day we were out. then, she said she may have to work that evening, so wouldnt be able to sleepover anymore, finally on the day before, there was hints that she wasnt feeling well. seed planting, if you will . the kinda thing you do when youre trying to get a day off work the next day so you start throwing into the conversation how run down youre feeling.

The day of my Birthday came, and i woke up to a message saying that Sheila had taken a girl from work to the hospital through the night, lets call her Paige. Paige had taken really unwell, and sheila stayed with her in the hospital. so she was gonna miss the first part of my birthday while catching up on sleep. i was bummed, but felt i couldnt express it because i would be made out to be selfish for acting out when someones taking ill. so i just agreed and got ready to see the rest of my friends.

we all met up, and someone asked me where sheila was , as she was my best friend and people found it weird she wasnt there yet. I explained the situation and i was looked at dumbfounded. the girls i was with, all work with sheila and paige, and informed me that paige had been fine the full evening at work the night before. It was a quiet night, she was chatty & of fine health, and that she had actually been boasting about having other plans to the girls before her and sheila left early. basically, the hospital was used as a ""get out of jail free card"" so that i couldnt be mad, when they hadnt been there at all. i was GUTTED. i struggle with abandonment issues or rejection, i dont know where its came from , but its a struggle that im trying to overcome with therapy etc. and this really triggered me.

I pushed it to the back of my mind, and enjoyed my time with the people who showed up for me, and i got a text near the end of the evening saying Sheila had just woke up and wouldnt be joining at all. all while Paige was posting on instagram that she herself, was on a night out (which i cant imagine someone just out of hospital would or should be doing). i decided to bring up what i was told to sheila, and she was LIVID. i was called a bad friend, how dare i call her a liar, i was selfish, and that she would be talking to me about this when i wasnt ""with a bunch of fucking gossips"" , AITA?",0.0,0.19289312,0,1
64,1gphu4j,AITAH for not having dinner ready when my parents got home?,"Hey Reddit, am I the ah?

My parents went out of town for the day, and only came back at night. Throughout the day I would check in to see how the trip was going and asked what they wanted for dinner. Multiple times. The responses I got were ""Don't worry about us"" ""We will eat on the way home"" ""Just have leftovers, there are plenty in the fridge"". I asked about 4 times, and even waited until later to eat dinner myself, just in case they changed they mind.
 They didn't eat on the way home and when I called the last time, at about 10 pm they were leaving one friend who went with them at her place. I said I had not had dinner yet and they said they didn't eat too, I asked ""Are you guys bringing anything home?"" Since it's not uncommon for us to get take out or go to a drive through in situations like this.
 My mom said she wasn't hungry, and didn't want to eat, just to get home and go to bed. My father said the following: "" Now that you mention it, I'm not hungry either... but you can heat up a frozen pizza"" From what I understood, they weren't hungry but if I wanted, I could eat the pizza. So I said ""No nevermind, if you aren't hungry I'll just have a snack"" and then the phone call ended. 
30 min later they came home, and my father asked about the pizza, I was in the kitchen eating chips, at about 11pm and I said just that, that I didn't make it cause they weren't hungry and I didn't really want pizza that badly to go make it at 10 pm. My father said ""Oh is that so? Not a problem."" And left me and my mom and went to grab dinner by himself, clearly pissed off.
 He came back about an hour later, got home and locked himself in their room. When I went to bed I stopped by the end of the hall and said goodnight. They usually said goodnight as well but he didn't answer me, only my mom did.
 This morning when I woke up, as they were leaving for work, I went to say goodbye at the door before they left, as I always do, before I leave for school an hour later, and when he saw come out of my room he didn't even look at me, just turned his back and started walking to the car, leaving my mom at the door, since she was giving me a kiss goodbye, I even said ""Bye!!"" And he didn't even bother to reply back... I don't know what to do, do I bring it up when they get home? Or do I just ignore it? Am I in the wrong?

66,1gpgoq4,AITA for asking my roommate to tell me when her boyfriend comes over?,"I live with my ex and 2 other roommates. I’m working on relocating but I can’t until next semester. They left me over the summer for someone else. I’ve been a huge train wreck since it happened. 

So far she’s always given me notice before having her boyfriend over, but today I walked into the common area and there was just some guy there hanging out with all of my roommates. She gave me a really weird anxious look, and I texted her about it and she gradually admitted it was her boyfriend. I was super upset, felt shaky. I got my stuff ready and went back into the common room. I introduced myself to Martin and said it was nice to meet him, wished everyone a good night, and left.  

My other roommate, whose been my best friend for years, ran outside after me. He asked me where I was going and I told him I didn’t know. I also told him that I thought she should have told me he was going to be there. He said that she lived here too and she didn’t owe me that. I turned around and left. I’m deeply upset with both of them. I went to our universities music hall and played piano for a bit to calm down, and called some loved ones. 

I think I deserve to feel comfortable where I live, and I think it’s fair to just ask for notice when someone is coming over. I’m really hurt and confused that the two people I once considered my closest friends don’t seem to care very much.

67,1gpgnlp,AITA for not letting my friend (22F) come over to my (21F) apartment?,"My friend ""Nancy"" (22F) and I (21F) are very close and see each other about 4-5 times a week, both from hanging out and at dance practices since we are on the same dance team. Last Wednesday, I texted her and asked if she wanted to go see a movie with me on Friday. She said that she couldn't because she had other plans and she also needed to go back home to get ready for a dance performance we had that night. On Thursday, she texts me about a movie she really wants to see and says that she wants to see it Friday and told me ""f\*\*\* getting ready"". I bought the tickets for us and thought this meant she would quickly change somewhere on campus or maybe find time to drive home anyways. For context, she lives around 30-40 minutes from our college campus where the performance is and I live right by campus. Not once did she ask me to get ready at my place, and I also never offered. (For context again, she has never been over to my place before and I usually don't have people over often, if at all. This is because I have autism, ADHD and severe depression, so it's really difficult for me to keep my space clean and my apartment is usually not suitable for guests. This friend also knows about my mental health issues and messiness.) 

On Friday, we go to see the movie and she mentions to me that she brought her stuff with her to get ready. After the movie, we got back in the car and she asked me when I needed to be back at my place to get ready for the performance. I told her that I wouldn't take long to get ready and mentioned that she couldn't come over to my place because it was messy. She immediately became very upset/angry and asked if I had expected her to drop me off and then find some place to get ready on campus. I said ""yeah, I guess so"" because I had become pretty anxious and didn't know what to say in response to her anger. The car ride home was silent and tense, one of the most uncomfortable atmospheres I've ever experienced. When she parked in front of my place, I apologized again and tried to explain the situation further, but she cut me off, said that she didn't want to hear it and that she was annoyed about some things. I got out of the car and went home. What she ended up doing was going home to get ready for the performance and she still ended up being early. 

In the following days, she has unshared her location with me and either not shown up to dance practice, or when she does show up she's completely ignored me. I texted her to ask if we were okay and her response was ""i'm not okay with where our friendship is at right now, i need space"".

I am in my third year of university, and have been in an arrangement with my mother where she pays one semester of tuition, and I pay the other. My tuition is upwards of five grand. This year, however, our great-grandmother passed away and left us nearly 10k in inheritance, of which my mother so generously said she would use to pay both semesters of tuition. This was very helpful, as I had just lost my job and was struggling to get by. Recently, I’ve got a new job, and received a bonus of 2k for the work I did in applying for a company grant, and also received 1k from a school grant. I intended to use this money to pay my round of tuition once the fall comes around, as my finances are still hurting from unemployment. However, my mother now says she is entitled to both my work bonus and scholarship, because it is money I received for the winter semester this year (which is being paid for with my grandmothers inheritance). I very much need the money, as I may be unable to pay for tuition once that time comes. As everyone knows, 3k is quite a lot for a broke university student. But on the other side, I understand why she would want the money. This is somewhat emotionally driven, as I overheard her talking to her friend about my work grant, saying it was effectively her bonus because it is tuition money that just so happened to come around while tuition was being paid for by the inheritance, and that she feels entitled to both the work and school grants. I feel this is manipulative, but once again, it does make sense. She and I have a fairly good relationship, not to mention I am profoundly grateful for any help at all. But we have had conversations in a similar vein to these before, and they rarely go well. I fear if I talk to her about it, it will damage our relationship. Money is the root of all evil, after all. 

I have not confronted her about this yet. As far as she is aware, she is getting the money. I feel I need it desperately, but it is also very gracious of her to help me in the first place. I am unsure of what to do. Please let me know!

I am in my third year of university, and have been in an arrangement with my mother where she pays one semester of tuition, and I pay the other. My tuition is upwards of five grand. This year, however, our great-grandmother passed away and left us nearly 10k in inheritance, of which my mother so generously said she would use to pay both semesters of tuition.

71,1gpgda7,AITA for not letting my mom come to my wedding after she ignored me my whole life,"
I (26M) am getting married to my fiancée,(let’s call her Sarah (25F), in a few months, and I’m super excited about it. But there’s one big issue with all the planning—my mom.

A little background: My parents divorced when I was 8, and my mom (let’s call her Layla) remarried pretty quickly after that. She married this guy, Dave, who had two kids of his own. Ever since, it’s like I was no longer a priority in her life. She focused all her attention on Dave and his kids. Like, I’m not exaggerating when I say she treated them way better than me. They’d go on trips, she’d go to all their sport events, and they’d get everything they wanted. Meanwhile, I felt like I was invisible. She didn’t ask about my school, didn’t care about my friends, or even my mental health. I started to feel like I wasn’t even her kid anymore 

When I turned 18, I moved out. I thought maybe she’d care and try to stay in touch, but nope—she didn’t. I’d text her once in a while just to check in, and she’d either not respond or say she was busy with Dave and his kids. I figured if she didn’t care, why should I? So, I just stopped trying to reach out.

Fast forward to now. I’m planning my wedding, and out of nowhere, my mom starts texting me like we’re super close. She wants to know all the details, saying how excited she is, and even saying things like, “I can’t wait to see you start this new chapter.” Like… seriously? I haven’t heard from her in years, and now she expects to be front and center for my wedding?

I told her straight up that I didn’t want her there. I said I’m not comfortable with her coming after everything that’s happened, and that if she really wants to have a relationship, we can talk about it after the wedding, but not before. She started crying and saying I’m holding a grudge and that “I’m her son” and “she deserves to be there.” But I don’t know how I’m supposed to just forget the fact that she ignored me my whole childhood in favor of Dave’s kids.

Now, my family is split. Some of them think I’m right and that I shouldn’t just let her show up when she never showed up for me. Others think I should just let it go, and “it’s just one day” and that I should let her come to the wedding to keep the peace.

72,1gpg9e6,AITA for asking my friend to help with her business expense after covering everything on my own for years ?,"
I female 22 have been running a shared business with a  friend Female 50 for almost four years, and I’ve been covering all the expenses (marketing, website, insurance, accountant, retail applications, etc.) to support both of our brands. I never asked her to contribute because I genuinely wanted to help her as a friend, and I believed in what we were building together.

Recently, though, my financial situation changed. I’m only working two shifts a month, and I have a child to care for, so I’m really struggling to keep covering everything myself. I asked my friend if she could split the costs of our in-person store space 50/50. She actually has more shelves than I do, and she was even offered her own stall at one point, but she said she preferred to share with me.

Instead of understanding, she sent me a message saying she didn’t want to be friends anymore, she sent me a message when I asked her what to do about any outstanding bills and profits and sent me a message saying “ You got your pound of flesh followed by We are no longer friends” after she removed her items from the store, and ignored any follow-up from me. I’m hurt and feel blindsided, as I only asked her to help with the store costs, not the other expenses I’ve been covering alone for years.

She comes to me once a week on Mondays to help me with Latin, which I chose instead of French due to my countrys school system. Looking back i dont know why, but thats not important right now. 

My problem with Mrs A is, that she smells and probably doesent wash herself. Whenever she comes to my house, i have put perfume under my nose and open all the windows to make the smell of sweat, urine, grease and bad breath go away. It wouldnt be a problem for me, except she always complains how i smell. Either my breath smells bad, i try to brush my teeth before tutoring, my deoderant is unpleasant or my room stenches like cat.

I have a weak immune system and often get sick, she knows that and still comes, even when shes coughing and sneezing all over the place. 

Ive decided to take matters into my own hands, and told her at the end of our last session, when she complained about how the hallway smells like old clothes and we should get it fixed, that she should please take care of herself before she comments on our house. I also mentioned her bad breath, sweat stained clothes and smell of grease. Mrs A immediately got offended, telling me that I should respect my elders and just deal with it. My mom remained neutral, told her goodbye and made her leave, before telling me that I shouldve been more respectful and not told her upfront, but my dad supported me in my decision.

74,1gpfn1g,AITA if how I act in an online game ends my 5 year long friendship?,"I recently got a random ban after a game of League of Legends (it was lifted after I inquired Riot) and told my internet friend, who also plays it but has more experience than me. He wanted to know what I usually type in chat. “noob, troll, useless, disgusting” I went, and he said that those warranted a ban. It’s also true that I got banned from typing in the game chat many times before, and him knowing that backed up his conviction that I was really a mean person.

He asked me if I’d be okay if I were playing a sport and said stuff like that, and I thought that obviously I wouldn’t, and that League and irl sports aren’t comparable with each other, much less when I’m playing as an amateur with people I’ll never see again. I told him I didn’t think that fact defined my whole character. He replied that he had a lot to say but preferred not to talk. 

Later on I ask him about a certain build, but I end up casually ranting about the enemies outplaying my team without thinking, and suddenly he started to focus on that.

He said he used to know someone that was the same elo as him, who also had a friend that was better than him, and said that guy #1 suddenly got really toxic and he believed it was because guy #2 “spoonfed him excess information he couldn’t handle”. He said he stopped talking to guy #1 because he’d just talk about League and how he hated the other players, told me he’d make fun of people’s looks irl, and claimed that I was just like him.

He pleaded me to stop talking about my games and I agreed. In the end we set some boundaries, and overall his final response didn’t seem charged with all the disappointment he’d just conveyed, so I assumed we were good.

The day after I asked him a simple question, but he didn’t answer. I assumed he was still mad at me, and just brushed it off not to start anything. It wasn’t the first time he’d outright ignore me, but it always drove me mad how he arbitrarily just wouldn’t communicate in any way at times, and I never expressly objected to it in fear of upsetting him.

I kept trying to initiate contact and hopefully spark a debate to discuss what he’d brought up the previous days, but to no avail. So I just told him he could say whatever he felt like, cause I understood that that was it for us. I would’ve been ok hearing anything at all from him, but he still didn’t respond. My patience having run out by then, I thought I’d assure him that the game didn’t make me toxic as he claimed, that I was always capable of being it instead, and that it only came out whenever I deemed it most appropriate. That how I wasn’t banned said a lot about the company itself.
And that’s when he removed me from his friends’ list.

I felt like I’d gotten at a good point with him, despite also knowing there were crucial things we disagreed on, and a lot we should’ve been transparent and honest about.

So, I was thinking I could ask my dad to buy it for me next year even tho we havent talked to each other in a year.

78,1gpf3gc,AITA? My bf (46) stayed over 4 nights in a row in my studio ,"My boyfriend (46) of two years is a very unique person. He’s spontaneous, low maintenance and is always keen to make a quick buck. I (32) am quite the opposite. I’m planned, like a cleaner and tidier environment and am financially comfortable. I don’t mind some extra cash but not at the cost of my wellbeing or stability.

My partner and I currently live in different places. He owns his own spacious 2 bedder and I’m in a studio. We have around 2 or 3 sleepovers spread throughout the week, mostly at mine. Usually these are planned in advance and broken up to give me some alone time on alternating nights. I work a demanding job and am introverted in nature. I usually need a few hours to myself between work and socialising and have communicated this clearly to my partner. 

Recently my partner worked out that he can airbnb his room for around $1K a week. He has done this a few times whilst we have gone on holidays.

I am also navigating several mental illnesses and am trying my best to keep my head above water.

My bf (46) stayed over 4 nights in a row in my studio  My boyfriend (46) of two years is a very unique person. He’s spontaneous, low maintenance and is always keen to make a quick buck. I (32) am quite the opposite. I’m planned, like a cleaner and tidier environment and am financially comfortable. I don’t mind some extra cash but not at the cost of my wellbeing or stability.

My partner and I currently live in different places. He owns his own spacious 2 bedder and I’m in a studio. We have around 2 or 3 sleepovers spread throughout the week, mostly at mine. Usually these are planned in advance and broken up to give me some alone time on alternating nights. I work a demanding job and am introverted in nature. I usually need a few hours to myself between work and socialising and have communicated this clearly to my partner. 

Recently my partner worked out that he can airbnb his room for around $1K a week. He has done this a few times whilst we have gone on holidays.

79,1gpf07i,AITA for cutting her off over a supposedly minor disagreement?,"This has been weighing heavily on my mind all year, so I figured I should get some insight.

I (18m) am the host of a plural system. There was one girl (18f) we'll call Stella for this post, who knew about this and shared this experience, who I cut off a while ago. She and I had a disagreement about a difference in a minor ideology. She is of the belief that plurality is exclusively from a dissociative, trauma-related disorder, which is not a belief I share.

One day, while we were on our lunch break in high school, I found out about this belief. Normally, I can live peacefully with a difference of opinion, but this is not a situation in which I could let that slide. I can understand why Stella would be fairly closeminded about this as her plurality is related to a dissociative, trauma-based disorder and I can understand why she would be wary of the idea of someone ""faking"" the disorder for attention. However, I was disturbed by her lack of belief in good faith claims and lack of respect towards differences, especially when it was originally through being different that she and I bonded. Stella was extremely disrespectful towards an I hope now ex-friend of hers who was a plural system who was not plural from a disorder. I couldn't let her behaviour slide, because I knew if she was being this disrespectful to someone she seemed to barely like, how bad would Stella be to me when she found out my plurality was not disordered like her own? I was not interested in finding out and, as soon as the break ended, I cut her out of my life. I have refused to talk to her since, despite her going through mutual friends/acquaintances on two separate occasions to try to talk to me. I will add that she has attempted to talk with me and be around me since I asked her not to, which I feel is a blatant disrespect for the boundaries I very clearly set, and I feel is proof enough that the disrespect would only escalate if she knew why I cut her off.

For a while, I have wondered if I am the asshole for cutting her out of my life entirely and refusing to talk to her, and even going as far as to request that she avoid being around me. Am I the asshole for cutting her off, refusing to talk to her, ignoring her, and requesting that she not be around me, even if she's only there to talk to our mutual friends?",Asshole,2024-11-12,"AITA for cutting her off over a supposedly minor disagreement?

80,1gpenxq,AITA? Canceling Thanksgiving Plans,"My parents got bleacher tickets for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade. This is so exciting! I go every year, so this would be my first time watching the parade **up front**. 

However, my neurologist’s office has two dates for me to do an [EEG](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875) for my refractory (i.e. medicine-resistant) epilepsy: right before Thanksgiving and right before Christmas.

I am agnostic to either date since I don’t celebrate the holidays. That said, ***the earlier, the better***. Thanksgiving is a God-send.

I don’t want to 🖕 my parents, but I don’t think they are fully aware that I spent a year tapering off a medicine (and replacing it with another), to no avail. I haven't told them the full extent of my experience tapering: dizziness and hand twitching as I started the new one, breakthrough seizures as I decreased the one I've been on for 10 years, and so on.

An inpatient EEG is the only way that my neurologist and I will know what to do next for my epilepsy. I tried an ambulatory EEG (i.e. doing it at home), but it wasn't successful.

I ***really*** would prefer the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, but I don't want to ruin their fun.

To make things more complicated, my father has psychotic depression and severe anxiety (bordering on OCD), so I do not want to be the cause of his relapse.

82,1gpeg8y,WIBTA for preferring to keep my car until it dies instead of giving it to my mom?,"I (21M) am a college student who works part-time and lives with my mom (59F) to save money and put gas in my car, a 2012 Buick Verano. Recently, I learned that my car needs work and will cost more than it ever has to fix. My dad (62M) — who has been helping me afford to fix my car for the last 4 years — decided that instead of fixing it, I would just drive the car until the engine gave out and then he would help me find a new (used) car after the fact. My car currently has 167k miles on it, which is essentially the end of its life span.

I told my mom what we had planned to do about it and she asked me if I could just give it to her for her to fix so she could have a more gas-friendly car for her commute — my car gets 23.5 MPG, hers, a 2008 Enclave, gets \~20. The issue is, however, I would no longer have a car to drive.

Now, a little backstory. She drove the Verano for around 7 years and gave it to me because I had just gotten my driver's license and her aunt gave her the Enclave before she died. My mom was upset that I was going to run her car into the ground because it was originally her car, however, it was not, it was originally my dad's. In 2012, they switched cars because my mom's car at the time was better for my dad's commute to work, so the Verano was legally my dad's car from the start.

My parents argued over the phone about the situation and I overheard them because they yell a lot. My mom argued that it wasn't fair that I would just drive the car until it died because someone could use it, fix it, and get more life out of it. My dad argued that if I gave her my car, I would not have a car. This went on and on so, I'll do my best to summarize it.

My mom suggested that I could drive his old SUV (a 2002 Ford Expedition) that we usually only use to transport a lot of stuff/people. My dad refused because the car isn't really viable for simply driving to school/work with its 17 MPG and MANY issues (i.e. broken gauges and wacky suspension). Then my mom suggested getting me the new car as soon as possible so I didn't have to kill my car, but due to financial issues, it wasn't an option. She said that could just use some of my savings, but both me and my dad are insistent on me not delving into my savings for this.

Not ONCE did my mom even offer to trade cars with me. She never lets me drive her car unless I'm taking it to a shop for her while she is at work.

I suppose it is more of an argument between my parents that I'm in the middle of, but I'm on my dad's side for this. He says the car is mine and I don't have to give it to her, no matter how much she argues. But I feel a little selfish in preferring to keep my savings to myself and just keeping my car until it dies and my dad can afford to help me find a new one — it's something that we agreed upon. I do have enough saved currently to theoretically get a new (used) car, but I would rather save it for emergencies when I'm on my own.

83,1gpe2zq,AITA for being late but not knowing that I’m even late?,"This morning at 9:18 my dad texted me that my grandmother wanted me to visit since it had been a while. I have time stamps of texts and calls so here is everything from my point of view: 

I replied and told him sure and went to go take a morning poopoo and shower at 9:30. 

At 10:05 I emerge from the bathroom and realize that he already left the house. I text him to confirm this and he said he would come back to the house and we could walk to my grandmother’s house together. 

At 10:11 he texts and calls me that he’s here. I tell him to give me a few mins, finish my skincare, pull socks on and am out on the driveway by 10:14. 

I stand like an idiot out there for a while before I realized he was not there, and since I locked the door behind me, I just decide to walk to her house myself. I let my dad know this. 

He calls me at 10:19 to let me know that they left already and are “out”. But they can come back to pick me up (I thought that was the plan already?) I’ve already walked partway there so I have to turn around and walk home and FT my bf to let me back in the house LOL. 

I just tell them to enjoy their outing at this point because all the miscommunication is confusing me and pissing me off. My point was that if I was told a set time to be ready by, I would have been ready at that time. But I was not, and even then I feel like a 30-40 min time span to get ready on a day I was preparing to not go outside (my only day off) is not too long. I was planning to be a greaseball in bed but had to take an everything shower instead. (Also why say you’re coming to pick me up with someone who really wants to see me and then just drive off with them after three minutes??

My dad’s POV is that he checked the first time and I wasn’t ready, he knocked on my door to tell me where he was going (I was in the shower so I didn’t hear, my bf confirmed he knocked but didn’t make out what he said)  the second time and then that he came back to pick me up with my grandma but waited five minutes and I still wasn’t ready so they left. I know he did not wait 5 minutes because of the time stamps on the texts. And there was no text communication of him leaving or going or ANYTHING about his location.

My mom’s input was that I know what type of person he is and that he is impatient and that I should accommodate that.

Whenever I talk to him my bf gets very sad and moody. We’ve talked about it in the past and he told me at first it was because I would talk to him for too long. I would only talk to him for maybe 10-20 mins whenever I saw him which wasn’t quite that often and we only really see him at parties. However we talked about it again, and he said that the reason he doesn’t like it is because he’s afraid and is projecting his ex girlfriend onto me. When him and ex gf were dating she met a new guy at a party they were both at together and she kept getting closer with him after the party and on and eventually ended up emotionally cheating on him with the other guy basically. Now I talked to him, and told him I understand how you feel however you can’t project her onto me and tell me I can’t talk to another person especially since I haven’t and won’t do anything ever with this other person. So aita for that? There’s no infidelity between us at all. Nothing has ever happened, he just simply still has that baggage he’s holding onto. She’s not even his previous ex gf. She was his 1st ever gf and he dated two people after her before getting with me. So maybe that’s why it’s so hard for him. But aita if I keep talking to our mutual friend?

We’ve talked about it in the past and he told me at first it was because I would talk to him for too long. I would only talk to him for maybe 10-20 mins whenever I saw him which wasn’t quite that often and we only really see him at parties. However we talked about it again, and he said that the reason he doesn’t like it is because he’s afraid and is projecting his ex girlfriend onto me. When him and ex gf were dating she met a new guy at a party they were both at together and she kept getting closer with him after the party and on and eventually ended up emotionally cheating on him with the other guy basically. Now I talked to him, and told him I understand how you feel however you can’t project her onto me and tell me I can’t talk to another person especially since I haven’t and won’t do anything ever with this other person. So aita for that? There’s no infidelity between us at all. Nothing has ever happened, he just simply still has that baggage he’s holding onto. She’s not even his previous ex gf. She was his 1st ever gf and he dated two people after her before getting with me. So maybe that’s why it’s so hard for him. But aita if I keep talking to our mutual friend? ",0.0,0.013769423,0,1
86,1gpdss8,WIBTA for not inviting children to my wedding?,"Hello! My fiancé (27M) and I (26F) are engaged to be married. 

I have always envisioned that my wedding would be an adults only affair. 

The only issue is that my fiancé comes from a very large family, and has about 20 first cousins who are minors, many of whom are small children. I would hate to exclude any family and do not want to hurt anyone’s feelings. 

My fiancé doesn’t have a very clear or set idea of what he would want for the wedding. I have tried to gauge a little bit what he’d like and he seems to not have a definitive vision, but when I’ve floated ideas like elopement and otherwise he’s made it very clear he never imagined not having his entire family at his wedding. I haven’t brought up my opinion on an adults-only affair as I do not want to hurt his feelings.

89,1gpdgi0,AITA for telling my sister I am done being her caregiver?,"
I (16M) have a twin sister (16F), let's refer her to as Lara. Lara and me have splitting personalities, but for the most part we used to get along until high school. Since, Lara was an outgoing person, she barely studied if at all, she was obsessed with tiktok and stuff. Now I am not as outgoing as her, I mean i still go out with friends but only during the holidays and we do activities like basketball but yea you get the gist. Due to her dismal academic performance, compared to mine, I am always made to tutor her by my mom. My dad knows about this but he's busy with work all the time and travelling for different meetings, so he isn't really involved in this situation. My mom is a SAHM.

Now I don't mind teaching her, except that every time I try to teach her, she always manages to throw a fit or a tantrum and I get blamed if she does badly in a test. So I gave up. Next, she managed to fracture herself , at a friends house, apparently she slipped and missed the landing (don't remember too much ... happened 3-4 weeks ago) and ended up in a cast, it should take approximately 2 months for her to recover, according to the doctor and for the cast to be removed. They taught her how to use crutches at the hospital, but admittedly she wasn't the best with it. Our house is 2 stories tall, and there is a staircase to go up to our bedrooms. She wants me to carry her all the time. Now this isn't an issue for me, I am 5'11 she's 5'7, and am much heavier than her, except I am not free all the time nor does she want to take the effort to use her crutches. For the past 1-2 weeks I relented and had to do as she told or else she threatened to complain to our mom ... whose busy in her own social life, and gets fed up when we complain to her, except she takes out all the blame on me.

The last straw is when she called for me to take her down the stairs to drink water, while I was on a call with a friend , finishing a group project that was due the next day. I had enough and after the call, I went to her room and told her I am not her damn caregiver all the time and she needs to do stuff herself. Guess what she did? Called for mom and I got into trouble again. AITA?

Mini update: I spoke on the phone with my dad and he did say that once he would be back from his NYC business trip he would try and settle things, he agreed that my sister was acting really immaturely but he did ask me to continue to help my sister in the meantime since she needs it. However I take his words with a pinch of salt as every time he return backs, he's scheduled to go elsewhere for work trips or meet someone important in 5-6 days although it's not always the case.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-12,"AITA for telling my sister I am done being her caregiver?

90,1gpd2jg,AITAH for “stealing” from a baby? ,"A friend of mine (F) FaceTimed me (F) one night, asking if she and her baby could stay with us for a bit. She said her living situation was bad, and if no one else could help, would we consider letting them stay? I needed to talk to my fiancée (M) first. A few weeks later, she texted me saying they wouldn’t need a place after all. Then she called in a panic—the house just wasn’t safe for baby. My fiancée and I agreed they could stay with us for 1-2 months while she looked for a job and a new home. They moved into our guest room, bringing what fit in her car. We bought extra things for them to use at our house.

Before moving in, I communicated our ""house rules""—nothing crazy: rinse dishes, put things in the designated areas, and try to find a job. I told her I’d help her if she needed.

One day, my fiancée couldn’t find our laundry baskets and asked if she could return one. After asking a few times, I gave her a black basket, creating a new space for her clothes. Around now, we noticed she lies—about mental health, where things went, even small accidents—stuff that didn't seem worth lying about.

She stopped doing basic tasks,acted rude to my partner, and quit her job. She started cleaning for a guy she met on Bumble. I talked to her and said I’d need to start a 30-day notice (beginning 2nd month). I didn’t want this to affect our friendship, but needed a timeline. She decided to move out and stay with Bumble guy, leaving her things at our place.

For a month, she texted daily about coming to pack, but didn’t follow through. On Day 23/30, I texted her, reminding her, and she came over. I noticed she had packed things into two of our laundry baskets. I told her she could leave her things in those, but when she moved out, the baskets stayed. She claimed the black basket was hers, but I reminded her it was ours, as I’d let her use it when she moved in. She agreed to leave it but mentioned taking our towels and sheets, promising to bring them back. She left with some belongings.

The next day, I sent gas money for her to bring the linens. She brought the sheets but no towels. I texted her about the missing towels, and she claimed they weren’t with her. After a few hours of silence, I checked the guest room and found a towel in her vacuum-sealed bag. I texted her again, asking if she had the other with her, again she didn’t.

I was frustrated. I texted her one last message: ""You know what, you keep it. Good luck getting the rest of your shit."" Then I blocked her.
Day 30/30, I unblocked and texted that all her stuff was on the driveway. She picked it up + mail that had come to our house.

A few days later, I saw a TikTok where she called me her “insane ex-roommate” who “stole from her baby.” She focused only on the towel situation and left out the contextI felt hurt and conflicted. My friends and therapist don't think I’m “insane,” but the comments made me question. They told me I should seek professional help, which stung.

He struggled to keep a job, he often didn’t have a vehicle, our utilities would occasionally be shut off-etc. but we had a roof over our head & he *never lets us forget that*. 

Preface: we are not the type of family to “do anything for each other no matter what”. We were raised in a conditional way, living on the brink of poverty. My sister(29f) and I are now very protective of our finances & kids- we keep them separate from our parents because of how toxic they were/STILL are. 

Currently: My brother (23m), struggles with addiction, criminal activity and poor choices and my dad refuses to stop enabling him. Many times my dad has been dumb enough to allow my brother to use his banking info to borrow money. And he *always* takes more than he is allowed. My dad is on fixed income so this is problematic. 
(Ex: My dad has forgone his blood thinners to loan brother money and then had major strokes)

My dad has also been close to being evicted from his home bc of the theft from my brother. My dad  never pressed charges, but brother has been reported to APS by the nursing home and myself for exploitation of an elder. He has yet to be prosecuted for this. My dad and brother act like they are in a dependent toxic relationship. They will say they hate each other and then the next day my dad will be helping brother out with something or vice versa 

This happens again and my dad asks me to pay his internet bill because my brother emptied his bank account. My sister and I both say no- we’ve loaned my dad money in the past and have learned our lesson. I explain that if he would press charges on my brother for the theft I would be happy help but until then I’m not going to continue this cycle. He texts me that he is “very disappointed in me” and that he doesn’t want us to visit for the holiday. 

My sister and I had planned to bring our kids to visit him for the thanksgiving. Great! I didn’t want to go, my toddler *hates* the car and I despise visiting my dad but was going to do it for the holiday cheer and “you never know” of it all. 

Today I get a message saying he knows I am avoiding him but has no idea why, he thinks I am the asshole and that I am being unfair for cancelling my visit (after he told me not to come) because he couldn’t get what he wanted out of me. He continues to be manipulative with his words, says he was just mad at the time he said it, etc

(Despite health issues he mentally aware/sane/has a normal memory. There is 0 chance he “doesn’t know why I’m avoiding him”- he doesn’t want to be forced to say he was wrong and god forbid he has to apologize.

94,1gpcbxz,WIBTA for not spending the holidays with my mom and sister? ,"
Hello I (24f) have been getting treated like the AH for refusing to spend thanksgiving with my mom (43f) and sister (20f). 
 To give a little context I am in a relationship with my younger two kids dad and have been made aware that my sister and mom do not like him. I never try to force them all around each other and even attend family events with just my 3 kids and I. 
 This year for my oldest birthday I took him and his brother with down to my moms who is 4 hours away while the youngest stays with their dad. While down there my oldest and I got sunburned due to having to deal with them wanting to swim in the lake and not take breaks or give their sunscreen time after reapplying. While we were out at the lake my mom and her bf (55m) had their friends and kids join to celebrate my son’s birthday. I didn’t see this as an issue until they started to tell me things like “you should date my son” or “you need to get out of the situation you’re in” referring to my boyfriend and I. I also did not have my own vehicle due to choosing to ride with my sister to have two of us for the kids. This pissed me off resulting in me refusing to talk to my mom for a week after we got back. 
 Well within the past two weeks my mom has been asking if my sister and I would be coming down for thanksgiving. They are wanting me to take all three kids but are not wanting my boyfriend there. I already have a belief that if he isnt welcome then I am not attending because he shouldn’t have to be left out of everything especially moments with his kids. 
 I have explained to my mom I do not want to drive four hours alone with my three kids one being an infant on a feeding schedule and two toddlers with short attention spans without the younger twos dad as well as it will just have my nerves shot and me overwhelmed halfway into the trip. She was curt and dismissive of my response as if I had stabbed her in the back. 
 My sister has texted me asking if me and the kids wanted to go, again making no effort to extend an invite to my partner, with her, her son as well as her bf to my moms. I explained the same thing to her as well as explained my youngest has been having issues with a sensitive stomach now and I don’t want to risk her throwing up in her car seat while I’m driving and possibly choke. My sister responded with “yea ok” which always translates to she’s not happy. 
 I love my family don’t get me wrong but they expect me for every holiday to drive myself and three kids four hours there then back without my partner or be stranded with my kids waiting for others to leave if I join anyone else.

My colleague who is also a very good friend of mine is a huge fan of perfume. We work together in a small office and share one long desk (so the distance between us is 40 centimetres tops). She has acquired a habit of reapplying her perfume multiple times a day not leaving her seat. As you can imagine when she sprays herself, the smell is all over the place and it feels like I get covered in it as well, which usually causes a headache and sometimes even a nausea. We’ve already had a conversation about using Ganymede at work and she agreed to wear it to different places. So when I started coughing and opened the window after another perfume reapplying today she almost bit my head off, saying that it’s just a nice mango fragrance and my reaction is extreme, her perfume helps her feel more energetic and there is no need to be “a hater”.

Tonight, she connected her phone to our kitchen speakers and played an audiobook while preparing dinner. That's when I lost it and this is where I might be the a-hole. I yelled at her that after weeks of me telling her how uncomfortable it made me, her continuing to listen to this smut where I can hear it is completely inconsiderate.

Partner completey redecorated my side of the room while I was at work without any heads up.,"Basically as the title say, I have a really hard time with sudden changes, especially when it comes to things that are in my area of comfort. My partner and I have been together for almost 6 years now and she is very VERY aware of this and will often make fun of me saying ""is this your tism acting up"" when I am set on something or don't want to change something. 

So today is veterans day and normally we go out and celebrate since I'm a veteran and what not. But I had to work so we didn't go anywhere. Instead I end up having to go run errands for her after work and bring dinner home for our daughter because she didn't like what we were having but it was one of my favorite meals. So I'm already irritated, tired and just frustrated and I walk into our room and my entire side of the bedroom is changed, I dont know where anything is the height of the nightstand thing is super low and I just lose it. 

She got mad and said she was just trying to do something nice and she stated how she cleaned up the whole room and everything (I work full time and she stays home and does nothing all day....not even exaggerating, she complaints her back hurts too much to work, which is mostly true, but never cleans or cooks or does anything but sleep in and lay in bed) 

So im freaking out, can't find anything in my stuff. Start having a mini panic attack because all of my medications, cords just all my stuff important to me is missing or ""put away"". We get into a big fight and now we havnt talked to eachother since, and she never even made the damn dinner that all she had to do was just put in the oven and walk away....so i guess I'll be doing that as well. 


I know it's a small thing in the big picture but to change something that has all my things that are important to me and in places I know where they are, and remove it and replace it with something without my knowledge, fully aware of how much that stresses me out, and to just do it anyway screams to me that it wasn't about me at all.

I have three adult children... that includes two sons who live in Iowa and a daughter who lives in California. Every year where we can travel is great, and my husband and I (as well as any of the two sons who can) go to California. My husband's family is extensive. We like to go to the family spot where everyone congregates for Christmas. My dad passed over 10 years ago. My mom doesn't care when exactly we decide to celebrate Christmas, since it's really just a day we pick to open up gifts. So we have gone to my husband's family's get-together for Christmas when we visit, and then we immediately afterwards join my mother. We fly into Los Angeles, pop up to where my husband's family lives, and then we return to LA. She reasonably opted to visit my sister and her children (under 18) while we were not in town for Christmas itself. My mom agreed she didn't care about timing for gifts and such. And we all agreed it was a good opportunity for her to see my sister and her family.

So we made plans this year to go to California. We were not able to last year, since I had no leave time for a variety of reasons not relevant to share here... So my mom has not seen either of my two sons OR me and my husband since Dec 2022. I tell my mom we are looking at flying to California. I still have very limited time off, so it will only be for a week. I tell her when we will be there. And I say when we will be there and hope she will be too. She says, ""Well that doesn't work well if I'm going to your sister's house. If I have to stay for so little time, then why am I even making the trip??"" Which made me feel like ""why am I even making the trip"" was something that should bother me as well... Why are we even making the trip?? Oh yes, because we wanted to see you, and we don't get to do it often!!

Ok, well I get why as a grandparent or any other family member, you would want to spend Christmas with children. That's what makes it magical... I get that. But my mother sees my sister's kids for a good portion of the year. They visit, she visits, they see each other a lot. She has not seen me, my sons, or my husband in about 2 years. I get it. I'm not nearly as fun. But when she said she didn't see the point if she could not see them for more than a few days, and when she has not seen me or my two sons in much more time?

In the interest of honesty, I will say that in the last several years we visited, we seldom do much. I had limited mobility. However, in the last 2 years, I have lost over 100 lbs AND have had both knees replaced. My mom knows this. I am no longer a homebody saying ""Go out without me. I'm good."" With or without her, I plan on going out and benefiting from my new knees AND my renewed energy.

So I just don't know. I get that spending the holidays with children is more satisfying than spending time with adults, especially if they are not as entertaining.

100,1gpbnxn,AITA/rant- friend is TOO nice and I'm just miserable?,"I have a friend who is super sweet kind and amazing and sometimes it kind of annoys me. 

We'll go out to eat and she'll pay for my food. The first few times I would fight it and tell her no. After a while I just accepted it and let her pay, with no fus I just say ""thank youuuu :)""

 Whenever I try to pay for something she ALWAYS says no.

We work together and we have different jobs. Sometimes she does my job for me, leaving me absolutely nothing to do. I say thanks girl.. 
 I'll say I am going to work on something, she'll say ""ILL DO IT, or leave it for me to do tomorrow"" 

When she says she has a lot of work to do (and expresses she does) I ask if there is anything I can help her with, she says no. When in fact there are many things I could take on.

Even down to who walks through the door first. Or cleaning up. Or offering food. Giving me gifts 

When customers ask a question, I don't stand a chance in offering help of she's there.

I know should be extremely thankful and I know I am blessed to have a friend with such an amazing heart, but this is truely annoying. 

Relationships are give and take and at this point I am ONLY taking because I know she likes to give but dammit I do too and I can't express that lol. 

I am at the point where if I she offers to do something I just say yes and sit there and watch her do everything.

We'll go out to eat and she'll pay for my food. The first few times I would fight it and tell her no. After a while I just accepted it and let her pay, with no fus I just say ""thank youuuu :)""

 Whenever I try to pay for something she ALWAYS says no.

We work together and we have different jobs. Sometimes she does my job for me, leaving me absolutely nothing to do. I say thanks girl.. 
 I'll say I am going to work on something, she'll say ""ILL DO IT, or leave it for me to do tomorrow"" 

When she says she has a lot of work to do (and expresses she does) I ask if there is anything I can help her with, she says no. When in fact there are many things I could take on.

Even down to who walks through the door first. Or cleaning up. Or offering food. Giving me gifts 

When customers ask a question, I don't stand a chance in offering help of she's there.

I know should be extremely thankful and I know I am blessed to have a friend with such an amazing heart, but this is truely annoying. 

Relationships are give and take and at this point I am ONLY taking because I know she likes to give but dammit I do too and I can't express that lol. 

I am at the point where if I she offers to do something I just say yes and sit there and watch her do everything.

He’s been playing guitar for a while now and has invited me to several of his shows. I’ve always tried my best to support him and have gone to all his events without hesitation.

Here’s the issue, though: he hasn’t done the same for me. I’m a dancer, and I’ve invited him to my competitions and performances, but he either cancels last minute or doesn’t show up at all (this has happened at every event i've invited him except 1, where he only saw me for 15min and then left). Recently, he bailed last minute on one of my dance competitions that i had been preparing for a long time and even did my first solo, and it honestly hurt because I was really hoping he’d be there.

For me, he's excuses for not coming are kind of ""i just remembered that..."" here's a list on why he hasn't come to see me dance:

1. he's brother finished school early (he's 17 and can drive home)
2. he scheduled a meeting in the middle of my dance competition and he just HAD to take it home (competition was from 6:00 to 9:00 at school campus, meeting was from 7:30 to 8:30, my scheduled dance was at 6:30)
3. just had to get home to eat

One time, I mentioned I’d be a bit late to one of his shows (no more than 30min) because i had a birthday dinner beforehand, and he actually told me that if I couldn’t make it on time, I might as well not come. It was pretty discouraging, considering I’ve been there for him every time, even if it wasn’t convenient for me.

He has another show coming up on the 23rd, and I’m torn about whether I should go. On one hand, I want to be a supportive friend, but on the other hand, it feels pretty one-sided, and I'm tired of the imbalance.

In my city, water/sewer and garbage have to be in the name of the property owner, so the owner pays these bills and then reimbursement is charged via the online portal and each unit pays 50% of each bill.

My city does curbside recycling collection and curbside compost/yard debris/food waste. The compost and recycling are collected every week while the garbage is collected every other week.

Another office, located 55 miles / one hour away from home is struggling and asked for volunteers from nearby offices to help them out for a few days. My husband volunteered to help a day last week and also a day this week.

I asked him if the company is going to reimburse the mileage he’s putting on our personal car as a result of him volunteering. The company is definitely capable of reimbursement (they’ve done it before). From my perspective, it seems like a perfectly fair thing to ask considering he is commuting *4hr* uncompensated. Also, our car is not in great shape so the additional 100miles each day he goes is not great for the wear and tear on our vehicle.

When I asked about mileage, my husband said “no” and became argumentative and defensive when I tried explaining how silly the lack of compensation is.

106,1gp9ema,AITA for telling my roommate to leave the bathroom door open?,"So I am one of four people in my apartment. Myself and two of the others generally get along. It's not perfect, but no roommate situation will be, and I'm fairly happy overall.

The remaining roommate (we'll call them Alex) is a bit of a different story. Throughout the few months that we've been living together, there have been a lot of issues related to Alex. Most is a minor annoyance, some is a more serious, but there is always something going on. And it always seems to be because of Alex. I'll also note that Alex is of a different culture than the rest of us, and also is from a different place than where we now live. We've tried to be understanding, but as with everything, sometimes there will be practices we disagree on.

About a week and a half ago, Alex started insisting on closing the bathroom door, even when no one is in the bathroom. Apparently this is a cultural aspect for them, where it's considered impolite to keep the bathroom door open. I do want to note that this wasn't an issue until months into living together? That doesn't make it less legitimate, but it stood out as odd to all of us that this wasn't brought up sooner.

All three of us have disagreed with closing the door. It's not about any particular cultural stance. We have issues with that door and handle sticking, so if it's closed, it's hard to tell if someone's in there or not. We don't want to keep it closed without others being in there to avoid this confusion. We have offered to leave it mostly closed, so it's still mostly hidden but you can see there's no one in there.

This came to a head earlier today. Alex had closed the door after leaving the bathroom. Some time later, I really needed to take a dump. I see that the door is closed so knock to see if anyone is in there. There's no response and so I try to open the door, but because the door and handle really like to stick, it doesn't open and so I assume that someone is actually in there. I end up waiting in the living room for the person to leave, all the while really needing to go and not having another place to do so. I eventually realize no one is actually in there, when I see Alex and the other two roommates at the same time. I run in there to release what I'd been holding, but once I got out I let Alex have it. My roommates were supportive of me, as this is a recurring issue for all of us and we want to leave it open.

Now, I probably went further than was reasonable and I take credit for that. I got mad about having to hold that dump in and wanted to let it out, but could've handled the response more maturely. However, I still think that it was ultimately reasonable for me to take issue with this. We offered an option that would keep the area closed to sight while still making it easy to get into, and Alex didn't take that.

Last Thursday when I got to school there were 2 open parking spots next to each other so I parked there. Everything was fine until the end of the day. My friends, Mark and Joe, were coming over to my house but we got to my car and I saw it was wrecked.

Both of the left side doors were dented all the way from the back to the front. My side view mirror was completely gone. My left tail light was smashed, and the bumper was hanging off. Neither door on the left could open so I couldn’t get in. The car that had parked next to me was gone, but whoever *was* there did it.

Mark and Joe were shocked and I was kneeling in disbelief. I called my dad and he said to stay there and he’d leave work. He called the police but I was still in shock, so he talked to them before they asked me what happened. I told them what I knew, which was not a lot, and they drove me home while my dad talked to them for a little while longer. Me, Mark, and Joe went back to mine and my dad came home a little while later. He said they’d see what they could do, but there are no cameras in the parking lot so there was no video. 

Then, Mark yelled he knows who did it. He had texted his gf and told her about my car and she said she saw a girl, Annie, driving and the right side of her truck was ruined. Joe had texted his brother and he said that he saw Annie park next to me since her truck is bright red.

Annie lives in another town but she seemed fine. We werent friends but we knew similar people, so we hung out sometimes. Annie has a massive pickup truck but she doesn’t really need one? Her mom’s a teacher, her dad’s an elementary principal and Annie works at a grocery store. 

Me, Mark, and Joe drove over to Annie’s house to see if her truck was damaged. Her truck was in her driveway, her right headlight was broken, and her right doors were scraped. Annie ran out of her house and I asked if she hit my car. She freaked out and was yellin. Her dad ran up and said that he’d call the cops if we didn’t scram so we left.

Friday morning, I got called into the principal’s (Mr. S) office. Annie, her dad, and her uncle (the police chief) were there. I tried to say I knew Annie hit my car but Mr S told me there was a report I harassed Annie at her house. I tried to explain and ask if I could call my dad, but the principal said that they have a zero tolerance policy for harassment and I was suspended.

110,1gp7s6m,AITA for lying to my young child?,"My husband and I (33 and 32) have two young children. We are conservative Jews, who respect the laws of kashrut (keeping kosher), shabbat, and many other Jewish laws. We were both raised in Jewish homes. My parents were more traditional, and have become more religious in time, while my husbands' parents have become a little less observant with time.

One of my BILs married into a very secular family. The other married into a catholic family. We obviously love them all the same and still spend plenty of time together. Before we had children my husband and I would usually conceed our practicing preferences in the name of ""spending time with the family"" but that has now changed as we have small, impressionable children. The issue is that my husbands' parents have not understood why my husband and I are setting boundaries because of our religious observance. They are unhappy that we do not attend our nephews' baseball games on Saturdays as we are in synagogue services (for example), even if we attend the ones on Sunday. Family for them takes priority even if it means not celebrating a big holiday. I respect them and their choices, and am trying to raise my kids to have a good relationship with their extended families, while also instilling in them the values their father and I hold dear (until they are old enough to decide for themselves).

I had a bit of difficult situation recently. We were over at my in laws (with all my BILs, SILs, nephews, nieces) for a Shabbat (Friday Night) dinner and my in laws made us some vegetarian food and made themselves (and the rest of the family) a dish with shrimp (shrimp is shellfish which is not kosher). My youngest, who is 4, knows about kashrut and asked me ""why is grandpa eating shrimp? isn't shrimp not kosher?"" which I did not know how to answer. My husband did not seem like he had an answer.

My children (4 and 5) are both a little young I think for a conversation on free will, and how every individual is entitled to their choices and freedoms. I froze in that moment and told him a story that I thought was neither too big of a lie, or something insulting to anyone at the table. I said ""remember how in Judaism the biggest commandment is preserving and saving a life, and doing things for our health? Well grandpa has a medical condition and turns out shrimp is what can help him feel better! so that's why he does it ! isn't that cool how health is the most important thing?""

If he were older I would obviously explain to him that his grandparents are less observant, but he is at an age where he is very impressionable, and is learning all of these concepts. I fully support him deciding for himself when he is older what he wants, but I worry it would be confusing for him now to see his grandparents doing something he is learning in school is ""not ok""

My husband later told me that I should have just turned the question to his dad.

111,1gp7nqy,AITA For keeping my baby away from the family for Thanksgiving,"So here is the story. My grandmother and Great aunt were very close. My aunt died and my grandmother became a 2nd mother to my aunts children(my cousins). They are grown in their 40’s. Well one of my cousins was in a bind. She needed a car and had bad credit and no money. My grandmother was giving up driving due to age so she offered to allow my cousin to use her car with the understanding that my cousin made the monthly payments and she had a year to purchase the car from my grandmother.

My cousin made the monthly payments. However, after 2 years she still had not purchased the car from my grandmother. Well recently my cousin was in a car accident. It wasn’t her fault, but the car was totaled. The insurance company wrote a check to my grandmother for 5k, but mailed it to my cousin. My cousin thought that the check should go to herself for her medical bills. However, the check from the insurance company is for the car that was totaled  which is technically owned by my grandmother and my grandmother originally put the money up to buy the car and the car was in her name. So, in my opinion and my grandmother’s opinion the check should have gone to my grandmother. Also, I’ve been in an accident before and everyone knows that medical claims and auto claims are separate, so she would have gotten her medical bills paid for most likely by the other driver. 

Not wanting to argue about it, my grandmother agreed to split the check with my cousin 50/50. However, my cousin decided to forge my grandmother’s signature and keep all the money. Determined to keep the peace, my grandmother has decided not to bring it up to my cousin and she acts like nothing happened.

Now it’s Thanksgiving and my grandmother is insisting we go over to this cousins house like we do every year. My wife and I  recently had a baby and she talks about how everyone wants to meet the baby, but I’m not with it. I think it’s really disrespectful and not to mention illegal what my cousin did considering this is supposedly a second mom to her or atleast that’s what she tells everyone. 

AITA for not wanting to spend time with family or take my kid over for Thanksgiving? Idk if I can look at these people without getting upset.
