0,1gqrikr,AITA for not taking enough responsibility? ,"I've been doing phone repairs for a bit. Phone came in, screen broken. I fixed it, told the customer to keep it away from water. It slipped my mind to tell them that the water protection was actually not there anymore the same way it is on a new phone. 

Couple of days later, they text, saying that there's a problem with the front camera. I said okay, and told them I'll fix it, but they didn't bring it over immediately. (I put this part in later on an edit). 

They dropped it in water (a bathtub), brought it back. I replaced the camera. Problem is, It's heating up because of water damage, nothing can be done about it. I've been trying my absolute best to get it done, but now that it's not possible, they either want a refund or a new phone altogether. 

The thing is, water went in, and I'm not sure if it's because if it went that deep in water or because there was a crevice left open (which is near impossible considering I used multiple layers of glue & the old adhesive of the phone). The stuff I did is still working, and I tried to fix the damage I didn't even do, but I still feel bad. Did I really do something wrong here? Should I give them a refund, or get them a new phone out of pocket? Or am I just being guilt-tripped here? 


Edit: One thing I forgot to mention here, is that they keep saying the business has been dishonest. They were under the assumption that we were somehow certified, which we never were, nor did we ever advertise or say that we were to anyone.

After this incident, every time someone brings a phone in, I make sure that they know that we're not certified by Apple or anyone else. Carrier stores continue to send us phones, yes, but we never claim that even they have in any way certified us.

Another thing that probably pissed them off is the fact that we asked them to pay for the water damage repairs, should they be possible. They thought we should take responsibility, since we ""broke"" the phone, but we fixed it, and what we fixed is still working right now.

1,1gqrhbk,AITA for indirectly calling out a person in my family who has depression?,"I, (18)F have and older brother (21)M who has been suffering from depression for years now. Last night I received a text from someone in my family that my room back at home has been lived in. Before I left for college, I deepcleaned my room, from from washing all of the bedding, vacuuming, to dusting all of the surfaces, etc. The text said that someone was sleeping in my bed for the past few nights and left everything messy. Socks were left on the floor, the bed was undone with everything askew. I decided to set a boundary by stating that I don't appreciate people just coming into my room whenever they pleased, especially without my permission. The replies that I got were from my older brother ""taking responsibility"" for going into my room and sleeping in my bed, profusely apologizing. The next morning I received multiple messages from my parents saying that I shouldn't have caused ""chaos"" in the family group chat and that my brother wasn't picking up the phone and that he didn't come home from work last night. My parents were telling me that I should just forgive him and move on. When I told them that I didn't think it was right for me to be responsible for his actions, including not coming home, and that if his depression was that serious then just ""being nice"" to him and letting him off the hook was not going to help him at all. I told them that he should seek professional help. 

My dad responded that he wants to move on because we are ""going nowhere"" and that I don't know what my parents have been through. I responded to those texts by saying that ""No, i don’t know what you have been through but i know what i’ve experienced. And i do know that every time this kind of situation happens nothing gets resolved because we eventually brush it off. if you want to just move on then fine, it’ll be just a matter of time before another situation happens again and the cycle repeats."" 

They blew up over text. They stated that whatever I go through is nothing in comparison to what they go through or what my brother is going through, because of his depression. 

Situations like this have happened in the past and everytime they happen my parents just want to move on from it to make my older brother happy. I'm not necessarily close with my parents and I don't often share with them anything that I'm going through because I've never really felt comfortable with talking to them about it. But to read over text, them downgrading anything that I've gone through, especially things that even they're not aware off is upsetting. Was it wrong for me to have sent that text in the group chat?

2,1gqr8cz,AITA for not being able to spend time w a friend due to work?,"Constantly, I put people before me, whether it's my family, friends or even aqquaintances. 

Earlier this week, I broke down in class due to the amount of stress and pressure I am under from work, college and personal reasons in my life. My two closest friends are constantly asking me for advice on how to apply to University, what to say, etc. All those loans and funding what not. Since I am older than both of them, I suppose they both look up to me for advice, which is lovely really! But- when I'm a fully fledged adult with responsibilities more than the two of them combined, it makes my life very stressful. 

  
To put it into a sentence, I feel that I have two children to take care after every second of the day.

  
Now, my friend wanted me to spend some time with them at the end of week, although I am moving house in 2 weeks, I wanted to spend some quality time with someone I cared about. Unfortunately, due to the short notice, I cannot get time off work, which is completely reasonable. I tried to explain that to them, and they read my message and removed me off snapchat. Now, as an adult, I do not have the time to even amuse myself with people who do that, it is silly and immature. 

But, my two friends have made me feel that it is MY FAULT for not being able to get time off work. Both of them do not have a job, or money responsibilities of their own, they have two parents and a nice home. I'm completely different from the two, being raised to take care of my own problems when they arise.

3,1gqr4uz,WIBTA if I got a kid’s parking pass for high school revoked for running the red lights of my bus?,"**edit**: thanks everyone, definitely filing both reports you made me feel a lot better about it. I was very likely going to anyway but I have effectively no guilt in doing so.

I’m a school bus driver, specifically a mini bus for special education students of varying levels of ability. 

I was picking up a student this morning, and a car with two kids neighbor kids in it was stopped at my reds going the other way. Apparently loading my student and getting them buckled in was taking too long for their liking and they just decided to go while the red lights were still flashing and stop sign was deployed. 

I asked my boss what the procedure for this was and she said there’s a police report to file but not much usually comes of that but since it was kids at the school we service their parking pass will get pulled. 

Normally I’d be 100% for fuck around and find out, you’re breaking an important traffic law that is literally in place to save kids’ lives, but the only thing that’s kind of hanging in the back of my mind is that what they did literally wasn’t dangerous, just illegal. My student was already on the bus and we were at the very end of a cul de sac so there wasn’t any other form of traffic at all. 

I was given the paperwork to file once I had the license plate, which I will easily get since I see this car every day, but it’s very unlikely my boss will follow up on what was a pretty quick, informal chat, so it really is pretty much up to me what happens here.

4,1gqqzqx,WIBTA for talking to my roommates about their behavior and hygiene?,"For context, I'm in college right now and have an in-room bathroom shared between me (f19), and my two other roommates joy and Jane of the same age, and while they had the room together for around two to three weeks, I moved in later due to housing issues with the school.

Starting off with behavior, when I moved and tried talking to them they'd be short with answers and wouldn't try to talk to me. I mostly understood where they were coming from, but from the beginning they would leave items on my desk when I wasn't home, and I'd have to ask them where I could move it so I could use my desk. In the shower I had to buy a caddy because they wouldn't clear a space for my items even after I asked, despite there being plenty of room, Same for the sink area. My items are in the corner of the sink and they still put stuff there and even used my sponge once after a previous conversation where we discussed not using each other's stuff. I've come into the room after class and had joys shoes right in front of my bed, and it happened multiple times before I just put my step-stool in the way of her doing that.
For hygiene, they don't clean the hair they leave in the shower or in the sink almost ever, and the grime left from Jane's shower items are leaking onto the shower floor. We have communal trash that I try to steer clear of because I have my own, and while I don't mind putting overflow into my trash when we take it out, I've been asked to grab both my trash and the bathroom trash when joy doesn't have anything to carry. I think they are the kind to put used toilet paper in the trash and not flush it (they leave the toilet seat up and don't replace the paper) I tried to deflect because I have trash I need to carry but they persisted. I tried to get it, but the plastic was under all of the paper so I asked them to grab another bag, and I dumped the trash into that and didn't take it back from joy, so she ended up carrying it. it felt clear that they just didn't want to touch the trash, but I couldn't help but be so almost offended? That they thought i'd just do it and not say anything.
Sometimes I think it's the way our room is set up, I'm in the walkway when I sit at my desk. I've tried getting up to let them pass, i've tried to squeeze into my desk so they don't bump me, and they actually end up bumping me more than if I sat relaxed. They don't try to say excuse me, and I always try to apologize for being in their way.

Essentially, I want to know if l'd be the asshole for talking to them about any of this? l've tried to have small discussions about other things that I can't live with (they blasted music, so i asked if we could have a certain time when we stop the music. I tried to make it a discussion but they replied shortly each time I spoke). I don't wanna sound like an enforcer or act like I rule the room.

6,1gqq1ul,AITA for confirming to my boyfriend that I'd give my ex a chance if I was single?,"(EDIT: I'm 24f, boyfriend is 25m, ex is 27m)

First, I must clarify: he isn't my boyfriend anymore. We broke up around three months ago, and after randomly talking again, we have been trying to figure out if we could give it another try.

Because of this, we're spending a lot of time and effort talking not just about us, but about unresolved issues, old fights, etc. To make this post easier to understand, I'll just call him my boyfriend.

I'm generally not the type to delete pics/posts online after a relationship. My ex and I were together for 9 months (after almost a year of having a crush on each other) in 2020 and the breakup was tough. I even talked about it on here, it took me years to fully be open and emotionally available to date someone.

My boyfriend has seen all the posts and TikToks about him, especially the ones after the breakup. I've never hidden anything, I don't have any reason to.

Today, during one of our conversations, he asked me if I would give said ex another chance, and he asked me to be brutally honest because, he admitted, the way I used to talk about him and even the few occasions I mentioned him more recently make him insecure about us.

I replied that yes, I would. I thought he was the man of my life and we were even planning on moving in together when we broke up. I repeated (because we had a similar conversation when we started dating) that I still love my ex, but in a platonic way, and I would never talk ill of him. I don't have any contact with him, and I don't even know where he is or what he's doing, I wouldn't text him ever, but if it randomly happened and I was single and interested, I would go out with him, see who he became and if we could work.

My boyfriend went quiet and told me that it makes him think we can't work it out because he sees it almost as emotional cheating.

While I understand that it might be hurtful to hear, I was being honest and did my best to explain that in this scenario, he wouldn't be in the picture. Going out with my ex would mean I would be single and not into my boyfriend anymore. If my ex came back now, I would reject him.

So, am I the asshole? Should I have ""lied"" to not make him overthink?

  
EDIT: (wrote this is a comment but I'll also paste it here) Just to clarify: I don't talk about my ex often, like at all. We talked directly about my ex twice: the first one when we talked about our last relationship (and while I've dated after my ex, my bf is the first after him), and the second when, while playing online with a friend of mine, he invited my ex to the lobby (he didn't know, long story). I kicked him because I thought it was disrespectful to have him in there.

I actually met my ex last year (2023) in October (a week after that I met my boyfriend, to set the timeline), we went out for a coffee because he was in my town for work and I didn't feel anything for him, it was like talking to an old friend. He felt different from when we were together (obviously) and it ended there. He sent me a text later to ask if I got home safe, I replied and we never spoke again. My boyfriend knows this too.

7,1gqq1nj,AITA for asking my sister to schedule her wedding around my c-section?,"I (38f) am doing IVF to become a single mom by choice. I’ve been working with a fertility doctor for several years now and my embryo transfer is scheduled for next week. Due to a previous surgery, I have to have a c-section. Fortunately, my parents live 10 minutes from me, so I will be staying with them for the first month to recover. 

My sister (30f) just got engaged and recently mentioned that she is looking into getting married next Fall. If the IVF is successful, I will also be giving birth next Fall.

We had a family wedding last weekend, and, naturally, talk turned to my sister’s engagement and future wedding. I asked her to please keep in mind that I have to have a c-section and asked her not to schedule her wedding for that month. And she FLIPPED OUT on me. She screamed at me and called me selfish for asking her to plan her wedding around me.

Here’s my position: my sister lives in a different state but will be getting married in the state that my parents and I live in. Which means that she’ll be staying with us as well. This also means that she’ll have friends, relatives, the wedding planner, makeup artist, and the hairstylist coming and going from the house all weekend. The house where I will be recovering from a major surgery with a newborn baby. And who will help me with the baby if my entire family is at events all weekend? 

Am I really being selfish for asking her not to schedule her wedding when I will be recovering from a c-section or is she being unreasonable?

Edit: okay, a lot of people seem to be hung up on the fact that a) I am not actually pregnant and b) that I may not get pregnant on the first try. So yes, this specific situation depends on the IVF being successful on the first try. It might not be. In which case, I will reassess and make new plans. But, as I have stated repeatedly, these plans have been in place for 3 years!

Edit 2: If my sister picks a wedding date before my IVF, then I would push back the IVF for another month. People seem to be missing the fact that my family is incredibly close. Aside from my sister and her fiance, we all live within 20 minutes of each other. We have dinner all together every other week. We have a very active family group chat. We dogsit and catsit for each other regularly just because we love each other. We are all adults in our 30s but still go on family vacations with our parents every other year. Reorganizing our lives for each other’s benefit is not something that is out of the ordinary for us. That’s why I was so surprised to be called selfish just for asking for consideration.

Update: Okay, I get it. I’m a selfish asshole for even asking my sister to consider me. For the record, a few hours after the conversation with my sister, I had a conversation with her fiance. I apologized for bringing it up at all and told him that they could have the wedding whenever they want, I just will arrange for a friend or coworker to come over to help. He told me not to worry about it and that we’ll make sure everything works out. Contrary to what some of y’all think, I don’t like to be the center of attention. In fact, I am the oldest of three yet have spent my whole life living in my younger siblings shadows. I’ve just spent so long planning for this that I would have thought I’d get some consideration from my family.

I (38f) am doing IVF to become a single mom by choice. I’ve been working with a fertility doctor for several years now and my embryo transfer is scheduled for next week.

My sister (30f) just got engaged and recently mentioned that she is looking into getting married next Fall. If the IVF is successful, I will also be giving birth next Fall.

I have asked her through the window at these ridiculous hours to close the window and she still hasn't.

As a result, I'm showing up to work exhausted, losing focus and irritable. I literally am tired all the time because of this. I have tried earphones I've tried my aircon as white noise I have tried everything.

For some background we met when I was a Junior in high school and he was a Sophomore, we met through mutual friends and have been together since. For all of our relationship I have had at least a part time job, he had a job at one point but it was about a year ago and they slowly started saying he did not need to show up to work anymore so he just quit. Right now, I’ve been stressed out as I am a full time college student (online) pursuing a bachelor’s. I’m in my second year while he is in his first year of college (online, also bachelors degree). I have two classes at a time while he has one, we live with my parents and siblings as his living situation with his mom was not the greatest so he moved in. I always want to make sure he has what he needs and can get things he wants as well. I buy us our own groceries, cook us food, and for the two trips we have gone on I have paid for all the expenses we had for food and random things (stayed with family so no hotel). Recently I have just been thinking about how much I have given him and when we were on our recent trip, I sent some money I saved for the trip so we each could get our own things, he would offer to pay for the things I wanted and I liked that feeling. I brought up how I feel like I’m always paying for everything or doing everything cause even when I cook dinner I’m also cleaning the dishes I used for dinner and sometimes his dish. I’ve honestly just been worn out and worried because I don’t make a lot and want us to have things we want. When he asks for a game or currency for a game, I feel bad saying no because I know I’m the only one working. When I told him I want him to take me out sometimes rather than me taking him out and how I want him to be able to pay for his own things that he wants rather than me saying no all the time, he said he doesn’t feel ready to have a job yet and that he doesn’t want to be unhappy when doing a job. He said he will look for a job but wants to work from home only. I understand working and doing school is hard, but I feel like I’ve been doing it for us so can’t he sacrifice a little happiness for a job? He got a job offer for Walmart and he accepted the position, but last night right before his orientation, he said he doesn’t want to work and that he will get a job to make me happy but he doesn’t feel ready for one and doesn’t feel a need to work. I asked if I was asking a lot and he said kind of not really, but I just don’t understand. We’ve been together for almost three years, when it comes to things like this I feel like we should be thinking about both of us?

10,1gqputk,AITA for wanting swap properties but not provide my sister any cash?,"Background: I put the mobile home(MH) in my name for my mom, my sister, and her kids in 2006. My mom paid the mortgage until her passing in 2013. The plan was for my sister to take over the payments after she got back on her feet. Over ten years later, I am still paying the mortgage. I would also like to add, my wife and I have been covering the property taxes on my sister's portion of the land.
  In 2021, my siblings, cousins and I inherited our grandparents' farm. We all agreed that we wanted to keep the land in the family. I did tell my sister that if she wants to sell some of her land, then we can get it signed over in her name and she can then do whatever she wants. She admitted that she doesn't want to get any assets put in her name to avoid the possibility of it being seized and/or she would lose all of her state benefits. She hasn't worked since around 2005 and has almost $90K in student loan debt.


  Since moving out here, my wife and I have been working on several approaches to building a small farm business. We have found a number of USDA loan and grant programs that would really help us get started. However, we've hesitated to apply because trying to get grants or loans for a 5 acre farm isn't really viable.
  She asked if this would be an even swap and I feel it is. If we look at it from a tax assessment valuation, the farm land is worth approximately $53K, and the mobile home is valued at $40K. She agreed to trade even though she felt it wasn't fair and if we had we had sold 4 acres, it would have been ""life changing money for her.""
  I have tried to separate feelings from the situation and look at it from a purely financial perspective. This has been exceedingly difficult for me to do, but even more difficult for my wife. Me paying the mortgage for my sister, even though we couldn't afford it, has been an element of contention in my marriage. My wife says I enable my sister, but I have held the position that all that I have done has been for my niece and nephew, not simply for my sister. If it were up to my wife, she would have been kicked out and the MH sold years ago. However, I have never supported my sister's decision to not work. I most certainly have not supported her decision to let her children go without because she refuses to improve her situation. Which is a motivating factor for this deal.

11,1gqpq8i,AITA for not giving my friend shorts after he lost his tubing?,"
This happened last summer but it came up again today when debating with my friend and he still sees me as the AH. 

My friend (26M) and I (27M) went tubing down the river during a group hang (we were the only two guys in the group). During one rough patch, he got thrown off his tube, and when he came up, he realized he’d lost his swimsuit in the current. We were both pretty shocked and started trying to figure out what to do since we were far from our towels and extra clothes. He asked if I’d let him borrow my shorts since I was wearing athletic boxers underneath, which look kind of like swim trunks anyway. He figured I’d be less embarrassed since I still had more coverage than he does (he was wearing much shorter tighter underwear).  

I really didn’t want to walk around in just my boxers, even if they looked like shorts. My friend insisted I add this was the southern us so NO ONE was wearing speedos. Plus, I didn’t want to be the one dealing with stares. Instead, I offered to help him stay mostly in the water until we could get back to our stuff, but he was really annoyed I wouldn’t just help him out. He ended up trying to stay submerged, but it was definitely an awkward walk back, and he’s been joking that I “let him down” when he needed help. AITA?

I didn’t know who he belonged to, he had no collar and could not hear me until I was close to him (luckily he was a sweet old guy), and as I’m trying to see who he belongs to, the neighbor opens her door and I looked up and asked, “oh, does he belong to you? I saw him wandering and he was very close to the road and even got honked at so I wanted to get him closer to the yards.” And she said “yes” and then called for him. He didn’t immediately go over to her because I did have treats in my hand so I walked towards her door for him to follow. She came out to grab him and I said “I didn’t have much to get him away from the road so I grabbed treats” and she didn’t like that very much. Now, I fully understand that every dog has different dietary needs especially senior dogs and he could be allergic to things and I’ll take accountability for that but why be so hostile towards someone trying to keep your dog from getting hit? He wouldn’t have had a chance if he had stepped into the road since he was walking very slow and was limping. She was not outside or even watching him from her window while he was outside wandering on the sidewalk.

Now, I fully understand that every dog has different dietary needs especially senior dogs and he could be allergic to things and I’ll take accountability for that but why be so hostile towards someone trying to keep your dog from getting hit? He wouldn’t have had a chance if he had stepped into the road since he was walking very slow and was limping. She was not outside or even watching him from her window while he was outside wandering on the sidewalk. 

Idk… am I the asshole? I have fight or flight so I didn’t stay to try to talk to her after she grabbed him and said “Goodbye” very rudely. ",0.0,0.9882639,1,0
14,1gqpm8f,AITA for choosing to not spend my day off with my family?,"I (43M) and my wife (40F), have two sons (10 and 14 yo). We both work from 9 am to 5/6pm, even later sometimes. The boys have after school activities almost every day, so after work, we usually drive them to or from somewhere.
Then there's the helping with homework, cooking, house chores, etc...
The weekends, though less busy, are also filled with chores, driving, visiting family, and such.
In sum, we have litle time for ourselves as a couple,  and almost no time alone individually. 

This year, my company is giving everybody the birthday off. Mine is a Monday a couple of weeks from now. 

When I told my family this, they were exited: my wife said that I should swing by her workplace in order for us to have lunch together. The kids said that I should pick them up from school to have lunch.

I said, sorry, but I was planning on having the day to myself.

They were a bit desapointed, and I felt a bit guilty.

I love my family, but I was planning on going near the beach, walk a bit, and have a nice meal enjoying the ocean view, earing no other sound, but the waves and the seagulls.  Besides, I'll be spending my actual birthday with them, we're going away for the weekend.

15,1gqpk2w,AITA if I don’t want to meet my friends new boyfriend because of his past and present behaviour?,"My roommate and I (26F and 27M) have a very close friend (26F) who has recently, around September, got a new boyfriend (25M). We see our friend multiple times per week and have done for years without problem. Since she’s been with her new partner, she has become much more anxious, withdrawn and has told us that things have been consistently very rocky between them. She has also told us that her boyfriend, who we haven’t met yet, has tried to stop her from seeing us a number of times and has negative reactions every time she makes plans without him. 

A few weeks back, we planned a trip to the theatre last minute, and the new boyfriend told our friend that if she came to the theatre with us, they were over. This was because, according to her, he doesn’t deal well with last minute changes of plan and because he feels like we should be including him in our plans, even though we don’t yet know him or his interests. There has genuinely been no intent on leaving him out of plans, because we wanted to wait for our friend to initiate a meeting before suggesting things ourselves. 

She put her foot down with him and came with us to the theatre that night. She told us that they came very close to splitting, but that she gave him another chance because it was still early days. In the weeks since, things have mostly gotten better and seem to be improving, which we are pleased to see. 

However, a few nights ago, our friend asked whether we would like to meet her new boyfriend soon. Given how rough things have been between them so far, we said that we’re not quite ready yet and that we’d prefer to meet her new boyfriend after a few more weeks of smooth sailing between them. She has previously told us that despite her concerns about how quickly things were moving, he’d still introduced her to all of his friends and that he was now putting pressure on her to introduce us to him. 

She understood our feelings and fed back to her boyfriend that after they’d had a few more weeks to settle in with each other, she’d look to introduce us. Her boyfriend took this very badly, and has now accused us of isolating him and excluding him, even after having the reasoning for our decision explained to him.

I believe he’s having this reaction in an attempt to get what he wants, which is to meet us soon. Our friend seems willing to accommodate his desire to meet us soon, but we think she’s only willing to do this to avoid further arguments with her partner, rather than it being her genuine want. We also feel, as the honeymoon phase hasn’t exactly been rosy, that for us to bend to his will would be to legitimise potentially coercive and controlling behaviour, especially from someone who already seems to have taken a personal issue with us because we haven’t given him what he wants.

16,1gqozo4,AITA for asking my sister not to invite her partner to our plans?,"My (32F) sister (33F) just got married recently and has been with her partner a little over a year. I have no negative feelings about him, I think he's very nice and never mind seeing him. However, since they got together, there have been a couple of occasions where she has invited him to join plans we have made without asking. I get that she just wants him involved because she loves him, so I usually don't say anything.

Earlier this year we made plans to hang out at my house and she asked if he could come. I hadn't seen her in a while and just wanted to spend time with my sister, and I asked if it could just be us and if he could join next time. She didn't seem bothered by it and said no problem and just came alone. However, the following time I did make sure he was invited and we had dinner together.

Last week my sister reached out to me and asked if we could go out for my birthday, and I said I would love to have a sister date, but as I was out of town we would have to find another weekend. For reference I am 26 weeks pregnant, have a 2 year old, and just got back from vacation on Monday. She asked if I would be free the following weekend (this weekend) and I said yes \*but\* that my husband was getting oral surgery this Thursday and would need me to be primary care for our daughter over the weekend, so that she was welcome to come over and hang out but that I may be dealing with a lot. I said we might be able to take my daughter and go out for lunch/dinner depending on how the day goes and if my husband needs time alone to rest; otherwise we'd just hang out at the house.

She replied that she already invited her partner and they'd love to take me out. This bothered me a little bit because not only was it never brought up that he would be coming (I specifically called it a ""sister date""), but with everything I am dealing with over the weekend I felt like it was a bit rude to invite an additional guest over to my house without asking. I do not think she meant anything by it, my sister is a very sweet person who isn't purposefully rude or disrespectful. However, I am working on setting boundaries with those around me so I texted her the following: ""I don't mind if \[partner\] comes, obviously I like \[partner\]. But in the future can we discuss that kind of thing beforehand? It's just I'm dealing with a lot and \[my husband\] has to have surgery and I don't necessarily want additional guests.

I struggle with a lot of mental health issues(child hood PTSD, major depression, anxity, ADHD and autim. all dignoised by a profesinal and i am in treatment for them all) from childhood trauma and have severe chronic migraines. But overall I seem like a “normal” person, and I think that's what he gets stuck on.

Every time I try to talk about problems to my mom, well he's around. It turns into a dick measuring competition of which one of us is more disabled. Personally I think that's a regressive mindset and puts more stigma on mental health by saying there's a magical bar you have to get to for your struggles to really matter. But clearly he thinks two different disabilities should be measured on a one to one scale and his disability is worse than mine. He states that he's disabled to but doesn't have nearly as much trouble as I do and his disability is worse than mine. His disability being ptsd from time as a marin.

He believes because he's really disabled (the government sends him money every month) And I'm not( because it's incredibly difficult to get disability for migraines) that he gets to tell me how to handle my disability and that i'm doing it poorly. Not only that he very much implies that I'm not just playing up my issues but faking them.

This all came to a head when I told him well he was on another of his tirades, That he got a say in his disability. Not only Is he a man and his issues are actually taken seriously by the medical industry, but he applied for the military knowing about ptsd. He got 18 years of normality before going into the military, and he knew he had a risk of developing ptsd when he went in. I however was born this way and had no control over my trauma as I was a child when it occurred.

Please don't get me wrong. I fully respect veterans and their need for treatment. They deserve respect and validation. I was just tired of him telling me I wasn't disabled and had no excuse for not being a fully functional member of society because even if I was disabled he can function just fine.

I have never before played down his ptsd (and I don't think pointing out he had an idea that going into the military could and likely would result in ptsd is me down playing it.)

I just wanted to point out that it's not fair to compare our struggles on a one to one scale, and that i am just as deserving of understanding for my disabilities as he is.

Fast forward to last night, Dawn called me and requested that I change my plans for the concert and come to her going away party because her and I are close and she just doesn't really want me to no be there.

But on the second trip, I had enough. I told my parents it would confuse my child if mommy had one name with the grandparents & another name with everyone else. I asked them to please at least use my name, forget the pronouns, but for the sake of my child to use my name. I was informed that I am actually harming my child by confusing her by changing my name.

It’s obvious my parents are going to deadname me around my child. They aren’t going to change, & my child is going to ask me why they use a different name. I told my parents I plan to explain to my child that name is an old name that hurts mommy which is why mommy picked a new name. But now my parents are furious, saying I’m turning my daughter against them, & that instead I should lie & come up with some other reason for the change while also pretending the deadnaming isn’t painful.

I (29m) am in a friend group with seven other guys (all 26m-31m).  We recently went on an island vacation that we’ve been talking about a while. 

We’re all pretty into the gym (how we stay close) and our definitely not shy with showing that off. But one friend “Max” (26m) has been taking that to a new level. To be fair he has been taking extra good care of himself lately and made a lot of gains, but it’s reached the point where he insists that he’s shirtless in every single photo that we’ve taken as a group. Now all of us have been guilty of taking off our shirts for beach pics, but he did it like in bars. We’ve reminded him many times that we’re planning on posting these pics, and he said that’s why he’s doing it. 

So anyway I post one pic from the weekend. I didn’t think much of it, because honestly whenever guys take off their shirts and are not wearing bathing suits, it’s pretty natural for the waistband of the underwear to show a little bit.

Admittedly that night when looking at photos one friend pointed it out in a laughing matter, but it genuinely didn’t make enough of an impression on me to reconsider it when I actually made the post. 

Now max is telling me to delete it. I just haven’t really answered him because I’m annoyed he’s making me take this down when he insisted on taking his shirt off in every single picture.

22,1gqn48x,WIBTAH if I didn’t tell my best friend I’m pregnant?,"My Husband (25M) and I (23F) are pregnant with our first baby, and I’m very excited!! We’ve decided not to tell anyone until Christmas, when I’ll be into the second trimester and our family will be together. (So SHH don’t tell anybody okay).

It’s not too hard for me to keep the secret, except for every once in a while when I get overwhelmed and don’t have anyone to talk to about what I’m going through. Not that it’s a hard pregnancy so far, but it’s a lot of new things, and it can be isolating not having people to talk to about it besides my husband who is also learning as we go. 

This is where my dilemma starts. I have a best friend (22F) that I’ve known for over ten years. We were friends as kids, roommates in college, and stood as each other’s maid of honor in our weddings 6 months apart. She got married after me, and just announced that she is pregnant with her second baby. I’m obviously overjoyed for her and usually love when we text back and forth about life and her baby/husband/pregnancy. Lately though, a lot of what she’s been sharing has been how overwhelmed she is, how stressful it is to try to keep the house clean, how overstimulating it is to nurse her 1 y/o to sleep every day, and how she’s so tired and fatigued with her pregnancy.
I’ve never minded being there for her, as we’ve been there for each other during hard times for a lot of our lives. However, now that I’m also pregnant, I’m worried that her experience will too heavily influence mine and I don’t want to set myself up for the same problems/outlook she has. I’m worried that when I tell her I’m expecting, our texts will turn into conversations about all the things she struggles with, and end with “you know what I mean?” And just a general “this is the worst” attitude. 
I’ve also recently learned that she has some strong opinions on parenting choices like sleeping habits and discipline that I don’t completely share. I don’t feel the need to defend my thoughts to her, as I don’t have kids yet and her family operating differently than mine is healthy and important. Overall, I wonder if this is a point in our friendship where we have to rub off on each other less, and how to go about doing that. 
I want to stay excited and treasure every moment as I experience these things for the first time, and I’m afraid her struggles or opinions will start to give me a negative outlook on things or make me doubt myself.

Part of me would find it so hard to keep the secret from her longer than I have to. She would be hurt to find out on social media, or from someone else, as I’ve been the first person to know after her husband for her pregnancy. I just don’t know how to balance her somewhat negative experience without absorbing it into my own. 

Would I be the asshole if I didn’t tell her until she asks? I feel like we’re close enough that she would put it together not too long after the new year.

23,1gqn0b1,WIBTA if I don‘t tell her that the chocolate contains sugar?,"Update:
We talked yesterday and I told her that the chocolate contains sugar. She looked at me a little confused and said:“ Yes, I know? But I like it.“

So the misunderstanding came about like this:
She bought herself chocolate shavings without added white sugar and told me about it.
When she went shopping some weeks later she saw her favorite ones (dark chocolate) and decided that it was not worth the extra effort for her to get the other ones. She also told me, they don’t have the same crunch, so she decided to go with the „regular“ ones.

So thanks to those, that gave me the „extra nudge“. She smiled and told me I should‘ve told her directly. Have a great rest of the week. 

—————————————————————

Hello, 
my partner (f in her 30s) is quite into sport and not much into sweets.

She stopped eating ADDED sugar „completely“ about a year ago. 
She doesn’t have a medical constitution, but just realized, that she‘s doing way better without the sugar. 
She also doesn’t restrict my eating.
For example, when we went to a fancy cake place I wanted to go to, she also ate cake, but was feeling a little nauseous afterwards.
So she‘s not completely strict-strict, as sometimes she enjoys honey or if I bake something, e.g..

Now to my dilemma: every weekend she makes coffee for us and does a „special blend“. When she made it before she used cocoa powder, but changed to dark chocolate shavings. 
It‘s really really nice, but I realized some days ago that she doesn’t know that there is sugar in them.

She eats her yogurt topped with them and is beaming with joy, when telling me „they don’t contain sugar“. 
They do, she just had the wrong column when checking them.

I really love seeing her happy and I researched before and the chocolate shavings without sugar are 1. expensive and 2. I‘m actually not able to eat them (due to intolerance). 
I also really support her otherwise, when cooking, baking, etc. I check twice as not to include any sugar. 
(I also realize on the other hand that she‘s mostly checking for Glucose and doesn’t care about fructose.)

So WIBTA if I don‘t tell her that there‘s sugar in her new found joy? 

EDIT: to fix typos

2. EDIT: Thanks guys. I think I just needed a nudge to make the right decision. I‘m at her place tomorrow and will talk to her. 

3. EDIT: To clarify: 
The yoghurt used in the example she‘s eating has no added sugar. 
Yes she knows that there are different types of sugar. 
As I mentioned before, it‘s about added Glucose. 
Yes she is capable of reading. 
No, she‘s not stupid, as the package has two different collums as it‘s baking chocolate and one type of them has no added sugar but sweetener. 
Yes, I know, that there are also Health risk when consuming too  much sweetener.

24,1gqmu9d,AITA for writing about my bf in my diary?,"I'm new to this so please give me grace. This also just happened so I am still emotional about it. I f22 have a bf m20. Recently I decided to start back writing in a diary. I used to as a kid but stopped because my privacy was always breached by my parents and held against me. He went with me when I got it and even sat with me as I wrote in it a few times. It felt like a safe space. I could say anything without judgement even some of the worse things I keep in the back of my mind. I don't mean a lot of things I just speak out of anger and let the words flow onto paper. It keeps me sane and levelheaded during fights and I am so grateful for it.

Today my boyfriend expressed he seemed as though I was distant because I haven't been very physical with affection. I let him know that I love him and that I can make sure to accommodate for that more in the future as I know its his love language. We hugged and everything seemed fine until hours later which is now. I left my room to use the bathroom and when I came back I noticed he was moody and a lot more distant that before. We'd been having a great day so I was genuiely confused. I kept asking until he finally asked how I felt about our relationship.

Thats when I noticed my diary had been moved and knew exactly where he got it from. He wouldn't at first but finally admitted he looked through my diary and that what I said was disrespectful and his feelings were hurt. I argued back that those are my inner most thoughts and I can dramatize things when I'm upset as do a lot of people but that gave him no right to go through my things. I told him he has a lot of nasty thoughts but that no one would ever know because he never says them out loud and that his mind is a safe space. I can't keep those thoughts in because it seems like I'll explode. I wasn't cheating or anything I just had some choice words. Anyways before he left he got on the phone to explain to a friend. He says he knows he's wrong but that he deserves and apology as much as I do and that it was a mistake 50/50.

25,1gqmtzh,AITA for breaking my lease with my unmedicated roommate ?,"
I (24) and my roommate Sarah (25) have been living together for over a year. We originally had a third roommate, but when that didn’t work out, Sarah and I moved into a two-bedroom apartment six months ago. We share a bathroom, but her behavior has made living together increasingly difficult, and I’m feeling frustrated.

Sarah is unmedicated, does not go to therapy and has bipolar disorder, ADHD, and autism. While I try to be understanding, she often uses these struggles to justify her actions. She frequently frames herself as a victim and gets upset over minor things. For example, if I ask her to pick up toilet paper or if I’m on the phone at night, she can have emotional outbursts. It’s exhausting.

One issue is the bathroom. When we moved in, Sarah took over the entire under-sink area, so I used the bathroom shelves for my things. But she moved my items to the bottom shelf without asking. I texted her, saying it wasn’t fair since she already had the under-sink area. She replied with a long message claiming I was being unfair, which made me feel dismissed. When I responded, she accused me of disrespecting her boundaries, even though I was just replying to her message.

The kitchen is another problem. Sarah occupies most of the fridge, pantry, cupboards. She owns about 50 mugs (I have one), and at least 50 plates she doesn’t use(uses mine) but refuses to donate. I’ve expressed frustration about the lack of space, but she brushes it off. She also claimed I took over the coat closet, though we split it equally. Split down the middle. 

A more personal issue came up when I bought two concert tickets for Sarah and me. She sold her ticket to my best friend when she couldn’t go, but later texted her saying she could attend and expected my friend to give the ticket back. My friend refused, and Sarah blocked her, claiming she was “bullied.” This sense of entitlement only adds to the tension.

Other boundary issues have come up as well. For example, I bought a sectional couch, and once, I was napping on it when Sarah came home and demanded I move so she could use it. Another time, I was on the phone at 11pm at night and Sarah pounded on the wall to make me stop talking. She also texted me at 1am, telling me I couldn’t turn on the bathroom light. I feel like my sex life is dwindling because if I sneeze too loud in my room, it’s an issue - let alone having a sex life. 

I’ve asked Sarah to move her bed away from the shared wall, but she refuses, saying it would ruin her “aesthetic.” Every time I set a boundary or voice a concern, she accuses me of bullying her.

I’m reaching my breaking point. I have six months left on my lease, but I’m considering breaking it early. I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells, and it’s emotionally draining. I don’t think things will improve, and I can’t keep living like this. Am I wrong for wanting to leave?

I’m 18m and get paid more then my mother. My mother 40m used to get into fights and arguments and when i moved out it was when she was gone. My mother did not like it at all and tried to threaten me with saying my girlfriend’s parents were kidnapping and she was gonna call the cops. Fast forward to a few days ago me and my girlfriend are out getting stuff for me hygiene and clothes and shoes wise at the mall i get a phone call from my mom and she’s demanding i pay her 25 dollars but doesn’t say what (she has a bad addiction to drugs). When i tell her no im not giving her the money she goes ballistic on me saying its my right to give her that money that im her son and i should help her and alot of other stuff. I just i love you mom hang up. After the mall and alot of threatening voice mails and texts i block her we go to a good moral chicken place. My mother works here but it was supposed to be her day off not thinking we order our food and my mother is right there she then flips us off and right “fuck you love mom” on all of our bags. Then when we leave she texts me from a different number saying “you have enough to buy chicken but not to give me thats a lousy son for you” after that my gf takes my phone and texts her she then calls my gf a stupid fucking cunt and a dumb Lazy whore. My gf sets it off on my mother and blocks her and then we call her boss and tell him what’s going on. The boss then says that she has been pulled off the line and having a talking to. My mother then texts me saying i almost costed  her job that my girlfriend is a stupid slut that doesn’t but to drop dead and that im a stupid ass hole that doesn’t deserve love.

P.S if you’re wondering yes i was talking about chick fl a. ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-13,"AITA for almost getting my mom fired because I would not give her money  Hi guys, so i wanna start this off with a back story i moved out and in with my girlfriend of 5 years about 4months ago because i was paying all the bills in my mothers house.  I’m 18m and get paid more then my mother. My mother 40m used to get into fights and arguments and when i moved out it was when she was gone. My mother did not like it at all and tried to threaten me with saying my girlfriend’s parents were kidnapping and she was gonna call the cops. Fast forward to a few days ago me and my girlfriend are out getting stuff for me hygiene and clothes and shoes wise at the mall i get a phone call from my mom and she’s demanding i pay her 25 dollars but doesn’t say what (she has a bad addiction to drugs). When i tell her no im not giving her the money she goes ballistic on me saying its my right to give her that money that im her son and i should help her and alot of other stuff. I just i love you mom hang up. After the mall and alot of threatening voice mails and texts i block her we go to a good moral chicken place. My mother works here but it was supposed to be her day off not thinking we order our food and my mother is right there she then flips us off and right “fuck you love mom” on all of our bags. Then when we leave she texts me from a different number saying “you have enough to buy chicken but not to give me thats a lousy son for you” after that my gf takes my phone and texts her she then calls my gf a stupid fucking cunt and a dumb Lazy whore. My gf sets it off on my mother and blocks her and then we call her boss and tell him what’s going on. The boss then says that she has been pulled off the line and having a talking to. My mother then texts me saying i almost costed  her job that my girlfriend is a stupid slut that doesn’t but to drop dead and that im a stupid ass hole that doesn’t deserve love. So am i the asshole also sorry for the long post just been a crazy few days if anything new happens ill add it thank you for reading any advice would help.

31,1gqlgc3,WIBTA if I do not give my partner equity in the house in exchange for housework? ,"This dispute involves the following parties: Me (33F) and my partner (36M). Throwaway! 

I have a good corporate job; I bought a townhouse 7 years ago when I was single. Met my partner 3 years ago. He moved into my townhouse. Pays occasional (well below market value) rent, buys occasional groceries. I cover well over 80+% of the expenses. My partner is a PhD student. When he moved in with me  he cut a LOT of expenses. He no longer had to work his shitty part time job to pay his rent in a shared apartment with 4 other guys. My partner does do more housework than I (60/40 split), and he cooks more often (65/35). I do not mind this arrangement; I care about him deeply and we generally get along well and have a caring relationship. 

The issue is this: I am selling my townhouse and buying a house. I am fronting the entire cost, and am the only one on the mortgage. Before we move in, I asked my partner to sign a cohabitation agreement (basically a prenup for non married people). I gave him the agreement, which basically said I keep the house and doesn’t owe spousal support in the event of a breakup. We got in a big fight because my partner wants to have equity in the house because of the housework he does. I think this is unfair. I know enough divorced couples to know you should always plan for the future. I’m worried about having to sell the house if we break up in order to pay him out. 

Am I crazy? AITA if I stick to my guns? 

EDIT: a few people are asking why this is even an issue if we aren’t married. In my jurisdiction, if you cohabitate long enough you are considered common law spouses. We are getting to the point where if we break up, he would have a lot of the same rights as he would if we were married.

32,1gqkypz,AITA For telling my best friend that she's not as skinny as she thinks she is? ,"My friends and I are all in our early 20's. We've been friends for years. Been there for each other through everything. Things have gotten heated and tense because of an argument that happened when we all went on a girls trip to California. 

My other friend and I have a full figure. I used to have a lot of insecurities surrounding it, but I've accepted it and I show off whenever I feel like it. Life is too short to hate your body. 

My friend B used to weigh close to me but she's lost weight over the last year and a half and I just don't like her new attitude. She is 5""3 like me so we are on the shorter side. 

Before she was around 165 lbs and she never wanted to wear anything. Only loose baggy clothes or hoodies. We all tried to help her gain confidence but nothing worked. 

She told me she weighs like 125 lbs now when she went to the doctor the other week when we talked about bmis and how not accurate it is in this day in age. 

I put on weight during the pandemic and she lost it but it seems to have gotten to her head. 

During the girls trip, she was taking selfies in the mirror in her bikini. She was wearing short glittery dresses. Super unlike her and she also has become more ""flirtatious"" than before. She's never mentioned her weight loss or even acknowledges it, but she will do passive subtle things. 

Like over the past year, she wears she's full after finishing like half of her plate. Meanwhile we all down our meals as always. 

When we were on the trip, I figured she could put all that behind her and feast with us. We went to a nice brunch, some nice Mexican restaurants. 

I had a few to drink, and I asked her why she never eats her food. She said ""idk I guess my stomach has shrunk""

I told her ""girl you aren't that skinny you still got meat to your bones. Nothing wrong with that. Why don't you just let loose with us and not do this to yourself""

She then attacked me asking why I even care what she eats. I told her it's because I love and care about her and it's triggering to people like me who suffer with EDS and it has me thinking what I'm ordering every meal now.

33,1gqkcu8,AITAH for losing my temper with my mom because I was tired due to my period?,"I (20F) have always had terrible periods, especially the first two days, I'd have cramps obviously, back pain, dizziness, INSANE nausea to the point I can't even drink water, severe mood swings, etc.
It has been like this since I was 14, so it's been 6 years now and I just learned it's better if I stay home during these two days and not talk to anyone until I feel better, I'll only tolerate it and leave the house if it's an emergency, otherwise it's better to just rest.

So my mom knows all of this, I told her many, many times, and she does NOT like it, ever since it started she would scold my for missing school or something of that nature and would tell me to just take a painkiller and tolerate it (painkillers can only help with the cramps, but not any of the other symptoms) and we'd have long arguments about this.

As you can imagine, I reached my limit and started crying hysterically and yelling at her to leave me alone to rest, she got mad and started yelling back and it turned into a huge fight and I couldn't stop crying because I felt angry that she never takes my pain seriously, and now it's been two days and she's still mad at me and won't realize how tired I was but instead she's putting the whole blame on me, Am I the Asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-13,"AITAH for losing my temper with my mom because I was tired due to my period?

35,1gqk42o,WIBTA if I call out my friend for uninviting a close friend from his wedding at the last minute because his Fiancée does not like her?,"I (32F) need some advice on a situation with an old friend, ""Tom"" (28 M). A few years ago, Tom cut ties with me, Sarah (31 F), and the rest of our friend group because his fiancée didn’t like any of us. At the time, it was really hurtful, but we all kind of moved on and let it go. We haven’t heard from him since.

Recently, I found out that Tom is getting married, and it turns out that he uninvited Sarah from the wedding at the last minute—because his fiancée still doesn’t like her. This really hit home for me, as Sarah is married now and had invited Tom to her wedding a while back, and he actually attended. It just feels really unfair that Sarah is now being excluded, especially since Tom had no problem attending her wedding and was clearly willing to put aside his fiancée’s issues with her back then.

To make things even more frustrating, the invitations Tom sent out for his wedding were last minute to begin with. So, Sarah was originally invited, then uninvited because of his fiancée. It seems like Tom is once again choosing his fiancée over long-time friendships, and I can’t help but feel like he’s repeating the same behavior that caused him to lose contact with all of us in the first place.

I’m really tempted to call Tom out on this. I feel like he needs to be held accountable for uninviting Sarah, and for the way he has treated his friends over the years because of his fiancée’s issues. But I’m also worried that reaching out after all this time will just cause drama, especially with the wedding approaching.

So, WIBTA if I confronted Tom about uninviting Sarah? Is it worth saying something, or should I just leave it alone and let him handle his own relationships?

Edit: Answering some questions to add context: 

INFO: do you know why his fiancee dislikes Sarah so much? I’m assuming you and your other friends were still invited to his wedding, so this is weird.

I think at one point the issue raised was that Sarah “acted too familiar” and “was hotter than me”.

INFO: Your friendship seems already over.   What's your goal here?

Yes, that's perfectly fine.

Not fine, and will just get you uninvited.

* **Update: 1 Day Later**

Thank you to everyone who commented with advice — it was really helpful, even though some of it was a bit harsh, it was much needed and gave me clarity. I wanted to provide an update on how things went.

Tom had expressed remorse in the past for distancing himself from the group, which is why I wanted to have a conversation with him. However, after a group call with the rest of our friends (minus Tom), we all agreed that while we didn’t agree with his decision to uninvite Sarah, it was ultimately his wedding and his choice. We decided it wasn’t really our place to comment on it. 

As for the wedding, none of us are attending. The late invitation and uninvitation situation made it feel like we’d be walking into a situation where we might feel slighted, so we collectively decided to RSVP no. Since we had all already booked flights and hotels, we’re planning to reschedule our trips and have a mini reunion somewhere else instead. It'll be a chance to reconnect and have a more positive experience as a group.

While I’m still a bit disappointed by how things played out, I think it was the right choice for us. Thanks again for all the thoughtful input — it really helped guide my decision-making process.",Asshole,2024-11-13,"WIBTA if I call out my friend for uninviting a close friend from his wedding at the last minute because his Fiancée does not like her? I (32F) need some advice on a situation with an old friend, ""Tom"" (28 M). A few years ago, Tom cut ties with me, Sarah (31 F), and the rest of our friend group because his fiancée didn’t like any of us. At the time, it was really hurtful, but we all kind of moved on and let it go. We haven’t heard from him since.

Recently, I found out that Tom is getting married, and it turns out that he uninvited Sarah from the wedding at the last minute—because his fiancée still doesn’t like her. This really hit home for me, as Sarah is married now and had invited Tom to her wedding a while back, and he actually attended. It just feels really unfair that Sarah is now being excluded, especially since Tom had no problem attending her wedding and was clearly willing to put aside his fiancée’s issues with her back then.

To make things even more frustrating, the invitations Tom sent out for his wedding were last minute to begin with. So, Sarah was originally invited, then uninvited because of his fiancée. It seems like Tom is once again choosing his fiancée over long-time friendships, and I can’t help but feel like he’s repeating the same behavior that caused him to lose contact with all of us in the first place.

I’m really tempted to call Tom out on this. I feel like he needs to be held accountable for uninviting Sarah, and for the way he has treated his friends over the years because of his fiancée’s issues. But I’m also worried that reaching out after all this time will just cause drama, especially with the wedding approaching.

So, WIBTA if I confronted Tom about uninviting Sarah? Is it worth saying something, or should I just leave it alone and let him handle his own relationships?

Edit: Answering some questions to add context: 

INFO: do you know why his fiancee dislikes Sarah so much? I’m assuming you and your other friends were still invited to his wedding, so this is weird.

I think at one point the issue raised was that Sarah “acted too familiar” and “was hotter than me”.

INFO: Your friendship seems already over.   What's your goal here?

36,1gqjopf,AITA my roommate wants me to accommodate my life at our apartment entirely around her OCD,"**Disclaimer- I apologize if this post is messy/unorganized/a lot, this is my first ever post on here!**

I (19F) live with 2 girls in an apartment for school (22- F OCD and 23- passive aggresiv F).

My roommate claims she has OCD and says lights going into her room bothers her. I am not wanting to follow my roommates curfew rules of not being in the common area past 9:30 pm, specifically not having lights on at all in the common area past 9:30?? I don't mind her having OCD, and like that isn't the problem but she won't let me have lights on in the common area in the apartment that we all pay the same for. My roommates and I don't get along, they are mutual friends and knew each other before me moving in, and I moved in late so they had to make room for me. We have had problems in the past, but I have tried my best to move on and have still remained respectful even if they disrespected me.

I had gotten groceries late last night and had to put them away because my days are so long and I do not have time to do everything before 9:30 PM as a college student, and woke up the next morning with a sticky note (they did a sticky note because a week before I had left a sticky note on the fridge saying ""may we please make sure we clean up after ourselves"" because they leave crums out and grease all over the stove and its gross since its in the common area) on the fridge saying ""Reminder- no lights on past 9:30"". I just don't see it as fair (and also don't see the 2 sticky notes to be comparable because cleaning up after yourself is the bare minimum and expected as a roommate but having no lights on past 9:30 ever is impractical in my opinion), since I have not set any rules for them and let them do whatever they want bc I don't know them.

Each time we have had meetings they have both ganged up on me and are very hypocritical and do not take any blame for what they did and just accuse the other person. They claim I am being disrespectful because I don't want to abide by their rules set for me, but I honestly think no one has stuck up to them and they aren't used to it. In my eyes, I feel that if lights were such a big deal then she could have lived somewhere that accommodated to her needs. I use the dimmest of lights when in the living room and I don't want them to feel like they have power over me.

**-i sent a message in our roommate group chat saying this and my roommate laughed at the message but claims it was an ""accident"": (below)**

“in regards to the sticky note- it’s a little bit impractical to never have the lights on past 9:30 because i have long days where i’m out all day and don’t even have time to eat until i’m home or don’t have time to do anything till i’m back. i will try my best to be respectful of noises like i have been doing. we had agreed to not have the super bright lights on and agreed that the lights above the island were good, so i’ve been using those past 9:30. i pay just as much as y’all do to live here, so at this point i’m thinking that if there’s still a problem with lights on, then you should invest in something to help that (ex-there’s light blockers that you can put under your door) because i don’t know what else to do and it’s a common area for a reason.”

I thought this was very straight to the point and I am glad i stuck up for myself. ATP i think i will just live life in silence bc idk what else to do. I feel crazy but I don't think my argument is unfair at all. I am constantly stressed all the time and feel a hole in my stomach every time I walk into my apartment.

39,1gqj26l,AITA for playing (golf) faster than the twosome ahead of me?,"Golf related. Long post, TLDR at the bottom.

Played 18 solo today and breezed through the front nine, playing through several foursomes who were kind enough to get me through quickly. On hole 12 I ran into a twosome. I figured I could play behind them for a hole or two and then hopefully they’d also let me play through, but even if they didn’t, at least it’s only the last 6-7 holes.

Through the next 2 holes I realize this twosome is VERY slow for only being two people. It’s an older couple neither of who can hit the ball over 200 yards. They never even considered letting me play through so I started playing two balls to keep me busy and slow me down. Despite this, I am still getting to each tee box before they leave it.

On hole 17 (par 3) I roll up to the tee box and the woman is just now teeing her ball up. I am two tee boxes and around 40-50 yards behind them so I walk up to shoot my distance while she hits. Again, I am well behind them and I can’t imagine she could see me even in her peripheral. I shoot the distance, walk back to my cart, and wait for her to walk off as well. As she gets to her cart I walk up to my tee box to keep moving around and stay warm (it was shady and chilly, I didn’t want to get cold or stiff). 

I noticed them standing outside of their cart staring at me as I bumped my ball around the tee box, finding where I wanted to tee it up. I take out my airpods and ask if they are waiting on me to hit. They yelled back no and demanded that I wait. I said “I am waiting, go ahead”. They managed to yelled at me to get back in my cart until they get on the green and I declined. I told them I gave them time to hit but I am going to stay up and moving until I can hit. The man eventually got back in the drivers seat frustrated and his wife continued yelling. She sarcastically and aggressively told me to play through and I told her it was fine, they could play and I’d wait my turn as her husband VERY clearly did not want me to play. She again yelled at me to get off the tee and I wished them luck as they drive away. There is more detail to the loud exchange we had, but these are the highlights. 

I never asked to play through, I never hit into them, I never rode up on their cart and only approached tee boxes that were 30+ yards behind them if they weren’t done teeing off. I don’t think I did anything wrong, but what do you guys think?

41,1gqi5uv,AITAH for mistakingly accusing someone of stealing my wallet,"It happened today, and mind you I still feel like crap.

A few years ago, I got pickpocket and my phone was stolen. Now, I get very paranoid and scared when someone brushes past me. I always feel like they're trying to take something from me. That's why I always keep my things in my pockets and never take my hands off it. See, even if my phone is in my bag, under multiple layers of pockets and zippers, I steal need to verify if it's still here every now and then. 

So today, I was going from class by tramway. I was sitting down, because these last few nights have been terrible. I probably slept less than 10 hours if you had up the last three. As always, my hand is in my pocket, checking if everything is there. But as I get my hand out for maybe ten seconds, to scratch my nose, a guy walks past me, brushing against my pocket.

I immediately told the guy I was sorry, explained to him why I was so paranoid and why I panicked, how i got pickpocket once and it made me worry.

And mind you, I would've have had the same reaction no matter who the person was. I even get suspicious of little kids. But his friend started joking with him about how it was because he was a tall black man. I kept saying sorry, assuring him it wasn't because of that that I accused him. He said it was okay and it didn't  matter, but the look of other people in the tramway made me so uncomfortable. I felt like a terrible person.

I would never accuse anyone based simply of their ethnicity. I have severe social anxiety, and clutch my purse even when teachers at university walk by. But I really hope that guy didn't feel like i was being racist towards him. My roommate said that a real racist person wouldn't have said sorry, and my friends that if he knows I didn't mean it, he probably doesn't care,  but still.

Little edit : Thanks for the answers, guys. You all have been saying kind of the same things, so I'll answer here. First of all, now that it's been a few hours (and i took a nap), i do realize that it was totally an asshole move, regardless if i was trying to be an ass or not. I should have already checked all my pockets before accusing me. Tho i should probably say that I didn't scream at him or nothing, I just asked him if he didn't took it and was fully really to believe him if he said he didn't, which he did say. Which is still accusing him, i know. He pulled me aside to check with me to show that he didn't have it and then made sure with me that it was indeed in my back. I feel really bad that he was so understanding while i went full dumbass mode. And to why i didn't check first, i can't even explain it. Usually, when i get scared, that's what i do, but i think the lack of sleep and the fact that i was afraid he would exit the tram before i could catch up if he had, indeed, taken it, made me act crazy. 
And to all those suggesting therapy, I am, in fact, in therapy with two different specialists. I called one of them an hour ago and told them everything. They told me that, of course, i shouldn't have reacted that way, but also added that it's part of healing. That I can't get better overnight, and that sometimes, these situations will happen even if I try my best. I know that my anxiety and paranoia aren't anyone else's problem, but sadly, as it takes a lot of place in my own life, it sometimes interferes in other people's lives against my will.

I totally am the asshole, and to anyone who was ever wrongfully accused like that poor guy, I truly am deeply sorry. I will continue working on fixing all my problems and will definitely do better next time (even though i truly wish this never happens again).",Asshole,2024-11-13,"AITAH for mistakingly accusing someone of stealing my wallet It happened today, and mind you I still feel like crap.

A few years ago, I got pickpocket and my phone was stolen. Now, I get very paranoid and scared when someone brushes past me. I always feel like they're trying to take something from me. That's why I always keep my things in my pockets and never take my hands off it. See, even if my phone is in my bag, under multiple layers of pockets and zippers, I steal need to verify if it's still here every now and then. 

So today, I was going from class by tramway. I was sitting down, because these last few nights have been terrible. I probably slept less than 10 hours if you had up the last three. As always, my hand is in my pocket, checking if everything is there. But as I get my hand out for maybe ten seconds, to scratch my nose, a guy walks past me, brushing against my pocket. And as I put my hand back in there, my heart sank. I couldn't feel my wallet anymore.

42,1gqhw6k,AITA for having an emotional breakdown when my classmates called me selfish?,"Last year was tough for me. We had a huge exam that everyone judged our intelligence by, so as a perfectionist and straight-A student, I pushed myself hard to do well, impacting my mental health. I became more stressed and tired, attending extra study courses on top of school. My sensitivity also increased, as I’d been at this school for years, and most of my classmates, many of whom I knew since elementary school, had bullied me at some point. I’d become cautious around them, worried that if I upset them, they’d lash out or say things I couldn’t handle.

For our final English exam, our teacher mentioned we’d have a listening test similar to an audio clip he’d briefly played.

Afterward, I told my friends about the website I’d found, and they were happy, as it helped them too. But word spread, and three of my former bullies confronted me.

My language teacher noticed and sent me to the school counselor. I was terrified, worrying that they’d assume I cheated and could lose my scholarship.

I have very little knowledge of car except for how to change my oil. I hate mechanic shops with a passion because they always try to upsell and labor rate is ridiculous, so I avoid them until I catch wind of a major issue. My brother is not very good with money, and sometimes acts before he thinks thoroughly.

I recently purchased my first car for myself, leaving my old car (which is in my grandfather's name and isn't that old \[2009\]) sitting in my driveway. We were trying to figure out how to sell it when we found out that my brother would be willing to buy it (he and his wife have been paying off debt and were down to one car).

Rewind three months, he was trying to buy it then too to give to a friend who had no car at all. At that time, I told him everything that was wrong with it (all things that were, in his words, no big deal). More recently, the car started pulling a little to the left while braking, but I thought nothing of it since the car never had an issue stopping when you pushed the brakes.

Since he's family, my grandfather said we should give it to him for free, which I was ok with because even if we sold it I was going to give all the money to my grandfather anyway. My grandfather got the title, signed it, and gave it to me to take to him with the car.

We agree to meet and give him the car. I DRIVE 50\~ MILES in the car (he lives out of town) with no issues driving except the pulling to the left thing. We meet and exchange the car. He calls after he gets home to tell me that he had to use the emergency brake to stop all the way home (which has never happened to me in the 8 years I drove the car). He thinks he knows the problem, and proceeds to drop $600 on DIY repairs. He tells me the car is even more undrivable and somehow gets it to a mechanic shop. They inspect it and tell him it needs over $4k in repairs.

He texts me to tell me that I have ""royally screwed"" him and that it was ""not godly"" to give him a car that I ""knew full well as on its last leg (We are both Christians so I don't take that lightly)."" I figured I would take some responsibility for not getting the brake issue looked at myself, so I told him I would drive all the way to the car (90 miles one way) and tow it off to a pick-a-part lot, and whatever money they gave me for it would be his. He tells me no, that the car is in his town already and he would take care of it, and that I need to ""learn from this"" and that he ""won't hold it against me"" because he doesn't want to ""strain any more relationships.""

Long story short, iirc I only witnessed my parents started fighting after a few I was born, during my brothers' teenage years (15 years ago +-) where my brothers moved out of my parents house and started living with some relatives. This was also close to the time where I had childhood cancer, so my parents weren't able to really look after my brother's back then. So either 1. they were financially stressed due to my condition or 2. they were stressed that my brothers moved out. Either way, that's as far as I could remember them fighting.

Cut to a few years, I'm in elementary school right, maybe they got into a disagreement or some shit, I just didn't understand what they were fighting about. The fact that I also couldn't understand what they were saying to eachother in another dialect didn't help. So every time my parents fought, it just triggered some fight or flight moment I guess and I would just start bwaling my eyes out. So I did what every scared child would do right? ---- run to their mom. The thing is, in most fights my mom would stay quiet for the most part and my dad would just yell at her. She would just sit there and let my dad yell at her. What could she do? If she ever talked back, my dad would just tell her to shut up and make more insults. Each time I was in her arms during fights, I witnessed all of the yelling, shouting and other stuff. No violence was ever involved though, mostly just a few broken chairs or items, my dad never laid hands on my mom.

I guess this would probably traumatise a smol child back then huh. Up until today, every time I fight I would just start bawling and not say a word. Lock myself in my room, try to ignore the sounds. Eventually this backfired horribly and made any fighting or shouting noises into a sort of Pavlov's bell or PTSD typa stuff if there were any sounds or speech patterns that are similar to how my parents fight, my first instinct would just be to shut up and start crying, even if i didnt want to. 

(This happend quite a lot in public to, it's so intense that I have to excuse myself when I see some type of arguments outisde)

How could I dare to talk back? even if i knew that my dad was rightfully at fault, I still wouldn't be able to speak up. When my dad hears me crying, he instinctively thinks my mom is the one who makes me cry. All in all, every time my parents fight , my dad always only target my mom.

48,1gqev2l,AITA for not giving the neighbors kids candy?,"I, 21f, live with my parents in the Netherlands. Here we have a tradition on November 11 called Sint Maarten. It's where kids make their own lanterns, go door to door, sing songs for candy. Kinda like trick or treating. In my neighborhood we have the rule that the kids (and their parents) can only come to the door for candy between 6 and 7pm. No sooner and no later. It's also a rule that the houses who participate, need to have a candle outside next to the door. No candle means no songs/candy.

Now we have new neighbors (they moved here 6 months ago, but this is the first time they participated here), with 4 kids between 9ish and 15ish so of course they were welcome to participate.

Now I was home alone during Sint Maarten, because my parents were with my aunt, who's really sick. I was really busy with my projects for college, but between 6 and 7pm I happily put a candle next to the door and prepared a bowl of candy. Many kids came to sing songs and it was adorable. At 7pm I blew out the candle, grabbed the rest of the candy to snack on (there were 3 pieces left) and went back to my projects (I had a deadline that evening).

Around 9pm the bell rang. I opened the door and there were the new neighbors. The kids immediately started singing songs. I didn't know what to do and when they were done I politely told them that the planned hour for Sint Maarten was already over. The mom said that they couldn't participate then, because absolutely couldn't miss her tv-show and that her husband was grocery shopping.

Now I'd like to point out that we have a group chat with all the adults in the neighborhood and each year the rules are repeated. These new neighbors are also in this chat.

I told them that it wasn't my fault that they had other priorities and that I didn't have a candle outside. The mom told me that because I had the decorative lights above the front door on, they assumed that I was still participating. I explained the rules again and told them that it had to be a candle outside the door to prevent confusion.

She asked me if I was really going to deny her kids candy after they sang me a song. I told them that we didn't have anything left and she got even more mad. I pointed out that even if I had any left, I wouldn't have had enough for all her kids.

She demanded that I go find candy for her kids, when I told her that the best that I could do was some fruit, she scoffed and said that I had ruined Sint Maarten for her kids. The kids started whining for candy and the mom told them that I didn’t have any for them

In the meantime it was almost 9:30, my deadline was for 11 and I still had a lot to do. I was tired, stressed and had a headache, so I was grumpy. I still tried to be as polite as possible and told them that I had to get back to my project.

The next day there was a message in the group chat from the mom saying that her kids were disappointed that they couldn't participate and that she expected better from a neighborhood with so many kids.

So, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-13,"AITA for not giving the neighbors kids candy? I, 21f, live with my parents in the Netherlands. Here we have a tradition on November 11 called Sint Maarten. It's where kids make their own lanterns, go door to door, sing songs for candy. Kinda like trick or treating. In my neighborhood we have the rule that the kids (and their parents) can only come to the door for candy between 6 and 7pm. No sooner and no later. It's also a rule that the houses who participate, need to have a candle outside next to the door. No candle means no songs/candy.

Now we have new neighbors (they moved here 6 months ago, but this is the first time they participated here), with 4 kids between 9ish and 15ish so of course they were welcome to participate.

Now I was home alone during Sint Maarten, because my parents were with my aunt, who's really sick. I was really busy with my projects for college, but between 6 and 7pm I happily put a candle next to the door and prepared a bowl of candy. Many kids came to sing songs and it was adorable. At 7pm I blew out the candle, grabbed the rest of the candy to snack on (there were 3 pieces left) and went back to my projects (I had a deadline that evening).

Around 9pm the bell rang. I opened the door and there were the new neighbors. The kids immediately started singing songs. I didn't know what to do and when they were done I politely told them that the planned hour for Sint Maarten was already over. The mom said that they couldn't participate then, because absolutely couldn't miss her tv-show and that her husband was grocery shopping.

Now I'd like to point out that we have a group chat with all the adults in the neighborhood and each year the rules are repeated. These new neighbors are also in this chat.

I told them that it wasn't my fault that they had other priorities and that I didn't have a candle outside.

49,1gqes1j,AITA for walking away from and “leaving” my friend at a festival?,"I tried to keep this somewhat short but it ended up being long, sorry! I 19F went to a festival with a group of 9 friends, including my boyfriend. I invited along Abby (fake name) and her boyfriend and everyone else was a close friend and couples as well.

We get there and it’s a madhouse. About halfway through our time there, half of the group walks off together to go explore either by themselves or with their partner. At this point it’s just me, my bf, Abby, her bf, and her bf’s friend. We’re all trying to decide what to do to get food. My bf and I didn’t say anything and we were just standing there listening to them decide. So, the three of them walk off to get into the food line. My bf and I decide not to follow, and instead go to an ATM to get cash for food, therefore splitting off from the three.

I should make it known that my decision was partially made because I had a slight feeling that Abby’s bf and his friend were making fun of me the entire day. Whenever I’d make a joke or be loud because I was around my close friends, they’d sort of make a face at each other or try not to laugh. This was annoying me, so that went into my decision to walk off. 

Two days later I’m sitting in the car with my other best friend and I express to her that I felt like said boyfriend and friend were making fun of me during our outing. She says “oh that make sense” and proceeds to show me a paragraph that Abby had sent to her, my best friend, about how I apparently did something wrong. It was along the lines of “I’m not sure how to say this but (my name) left me and my friends in the middle of the festival without saying anything, and when I tried to find her she wouldn’t text me back!” Nobody had any service btw. 

I’m sitting there pissed and upset, because a girl that I thought was my friend walked off without me, then decided to blame me for “leaving her” at the festival and text my best friend behind my back trying to talk shit about my actions instead of just talking to me. I felt like I was a hypocrite at first because I expressed the making fun thing to my best friend and that’s sort of talking behind backs, but I realized that I was expressing myself, while Abby was texting saying “(name) DID THIS…” as an accusation.

The text wasn’t even trying to solve anything. It was literally just accusing me of being a bad friend and trying to talk shit about me. 1) I’m the only one in our friend group that’s been trying to keep her involved in our plans and 2) she hasn’t once hit me up herself to hang out, so our friendship has felt one sided. Lastly, 3) I was the one person in our friend group actually vocalizing and worried about finding her to give her a ride home, because none of us had service. The. Only. One.

50,1gqeq37,AITA for agreeing to wear my MIL’s wedding dress for my wedding?,"So, I (26F) am getting married in three months to my fiancé (34M). It's going to be a small ceremony at my grandparents’ house. I know it’s kinda late to be talking about dresses, but I was originally planning to wear my stepmom’s wedding dress. It’s a beautiful dress that I love, and it means a lot to me because she’s the one who raised me and loved me when my bio mom didn’t want me.

But here’s the thing: while planning the wedding, I got pregnant. I’m three months along now, so I’ll be six months pregnant at the wedding. The dress from my stepmom is tight-fitting and there’s no way it’s going to fit a six-month baby bump. I was devastated, not because I’d have to buy a new dress, but because I really wanted that special mother-daughter bond on my wedding day.

Last weekend, I was venting about it to my MIL, and I broke down crying. She then said she’d be honored if I wore her wedding dress. She showed it to me, and it’s a stunning vintage dress from the ‘70s with a boho/hippie vibe, gorgeous embroidery, and funnily enough, she was pregnant when she wore it too. She made me feel so loved and welcome, so I accepted.

The issue is, my MIL has a daughter (my SIL), and when she found out I got the dress, she was furious. She actually came over to my house trying to take the dress back, and even said I was “living in sin” for getting pregnant before marriage (??). My fiancé just kicked her out and told me not to worry since she’s always thought the dress was ugly and never wanted it. 

Still, she and my FIL have been harassing me on social media and through messages.

53,1gqe02b,AITAH - Not Attending Sisters Wedding,"Back story. My sister and I are about 13 years apart. She was around 4 or 5 when I moved out of our parents house on my own. We've never really had a close relationship because of our age difference but she's my sister and I love her regardless.

 Since she became an adult she has had little to nothing to do with me or my children. She doesn't invite us to anything, doesn't call me to talk, doesn't text. She's more like a distant relative and that's understandable because, again, we have such a big age difference. We are in completely different places in life. 

A year ago she got engaged to her boyfriend. I've met him a handful of times and he seems like a good guy. They decided they wanted to get married in a different state on New Year's Eve. 

During COVID, my family was practically homeless. We weren't always sure where food was coming from. It wasn't a great time for us and we went into pretty big debt just to survive. As things have turned around and we've started taking care of that I'm sure it looks good to anyone outside my family. 

When my sister announced the wedding will be so far away I was determined to make it work. Your baby sister only gets married once after all (hopefully). I didn't immediately rsvp as I was still trying to figure out if I'd fly, drive, or both. Trying to figure out the most cost effective way to get my family to and from the wedding. It's a good 24 hour drive so would need broken into at least 2 days each way.

My sister apparently told my mom she was upset that no one had rsvp for her wedding on her side of the family. My mom called me. It became a thing. So I let my mom know I'd be there.  

I'm currently working two jobs as we are working to chip away the Covid debt and my husband was laid off this past summer. Taking 2 days off to drive there, a day for the wedding, then 2 days off to drive back is at least 5 days of missed work. 5 days before New Years Eve is December 26th so we'd be driving on Christmas to ensure some buffer time. 

My dilemma - in order to make this work my kids (one of which has seen my sister twice in the last year and the other not at all) won't get Christmas. All the money we've saved up for Christmas will be spent on gas, the rest of the Airbnb, and food for the trip. We won't have money to do fun things while gone, we won't be able to buy Christmas presents. It would strictly be drive 24 hours to the wedding, watch wedding, drive back. 

Adding extra to this, my sister asked my nephew to be part of the wedding as a ring bearer. My kids have been an afterthought. No one has asked them to be any part of the wedding at all.

So AITAH if I don't spend my kids Christmas money to go to this wedding?

56,1gqd8nu,WIBTA for expressing that I don't want a tree cut down in my boyfriend's yard?,"So I (30F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for 4 years and we have lived together for over 2 years, we do have 2 children under the age of 9 and while he is not their biological father, for all intents and purposes he is their dad.

His neighbors, a married couple (50 ish M&F) are like family to him and I also love them, they want to have all 3 trees in his back yard cut down as they have a pool (that we have an open invite to use) and are tired of dealing with the leaves every year, understandable. They are also going to pay to have them cut down.

The issue is that one of the trees (second largest tree) has a swing on it that one of the children use often and will sometimes spend hours on, the child is also special needs and doesn't like change, and while they have offered to build a frame for the swing afterwards, it would not be able to swing all around freely anymore without hitting a frame like it currently is which is one of the things my child loves about it and also without the tree the rather large yard would be completely hit by the sun with no shade protection which is concerning when the child spends so much time outside, the tree currently provides a lot of shade over the swing area where my child plays the most. I feel like we have a right to have at least one tree in the yard, and I am also concerned that the neighbors are using the fact that my boyfriend is so nice and that they are so close with him, against him, as they've asked several other neighbors to cut down their trees and they've all refused but they know my boyfriend won't refuse, they didn't even really ask, just said they were going to have them cut down. They are good people though and I don't know if they would actually think that way. 

They also have stated multiple times that they don't plan on living here forever and want to eventually sell their house to move somewhere warmer. I also don't believe my boyfriend would ever have them cut down if they didn't want it.

Here's where I might be the asshole, this is not my house or my tree, my boyfriend had this house before we were together, he pays the mortgage and bills and he is the one that cleans up the leaves, while I don't work any money I do get pays for all the children's needs and groceries but not any bills, I don't feel I have a right to ask for this tree to not be cut down and also I feel I would be an asshole for stating my feelings as it would make my boyfriend feel guilty for having to choose to either make myself or his neighbors happy, and these neighbors would most likely do any favor we asked of them and even help out with the children if asked so I also don't want to upset them either. Not to mention paying for the trees to be cut down and building a frame for the swing after are all very generous.

So would I be the asshole for expressing that I do  not want one of the three trees cut down?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-13,"WIBTA for expressing that I don't want a tree cut down in my boyfriend's yard? So I (30F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for 4 years and we have lived together for over 2 years, we do have 2 children under the age of 9 and while he is not their biological father, for all intents and purposes he is their dad.

His neighbors, a married couple (50 ish M&F) are like family to him and I also love them, they want to have all 3 trees in his back yard cut down as they have a pool (that we have an open invite to use) and are tired of dealing with the leaves every year, understandable. They are also going to pay to have them cut down.

The issue is that one of the trees (second largest tree) has a swing on it that one of the children use often and will sometimes spend hours on, the child is also special needs and doesn't like change, and while they have offered to build a frame for the swing afterwards, it would not be able to swing all around freely anymore without hitting a frame like it currently is which is one of the things my child loves about it and also without the tree the rather large yard would be completely hit by the sun with no shade protection which is concerning when the child spends so much time outside, the tree currently provides a lot of shade over the swing area where my child plays the most. I feel like we have a right to have at least one tree in the yard, and I am also concerned that the neighbors are using the fact that my boyfriend is so nice and that they are so close with him, against him, as they've asked several other neighbors to cut down their trees and they've all refused but they know my boyfriend won't refuse, they didn't even really ask, just said they were going to have them cut down. They are good people though and I don't know if they would actually think that way.

Within 6 months he was apologising for his behaviour, asking to take me on trips and baisically begging me to take him back. He appeared to be over his drug addiction. I caved because I loved him a lot and met him abroad while he was travelling, we fell back in to a relationship. I told him I needed some sort of commitment. He spent a lot of money on an engagement ring and I believed he had changed although he had been slightly evasive over his social media and it took him time to add me back as a friend. I had to comment on this and ask why he wouldn't follow me. He was supposed to propose before January 2025.

We were due to go to a wedding at the weekend that his friends would be attending. I thought finally he would tell people we were back together and it would be known.

He wanted a new sofa and I helped him pick one. I showed him one I thought he'd like online and he ordered it. The sofa came this week and he went berserk. He said he hated it, didn't want to speak to me, I'd cost him thousands in sofas he didn't like over the years and that I should get plans for the weekend. I called him an abuser.

60,1gqbf46,AITAH for refusing help from my parents to look after their grandchild?,"INTRO: First time mom here (30F). Husband works away from home for a few months, so I'm on my own for now. Our baby is 3 months old. 

Lately the lack of sleep has been catching up with me and I told my mom I'm not feeling well to say the least and I should probably get couple of hours extra sleep. I have never asked for any help from anyone until now so it was hard for me to finally cave in and admit I need it now. It's also hard to even think about leaving my baby with someone else. So when my mom offered to sit with him for a few hours, I agreed but it would be best if he stayed at home where I was sleeping, so I don't feel anxious and can actually fall asleep. She agreed. They went outside to have a walk (we have a pretty big property). When I woke up two hours later, it was already getting dark, no one was inside the house so I went outside looking for them as I also saw the stroller wasn't inside. After 5 min looking for them and realizing they're not there, my eyes welled up and I started panicking, ran after my phone and called my mom (thankfully she picked up). Apparently she decided it was best for me they went to her house so they don't make noise and disturb my sleep. My dad picked them up. With no car seat might I add... Although it's only 5 min drive, but still anything can happen. My mom actually left a note but she put it in a really shitty place so I didn't  see it and it didn't save me from panicking. When I went to them I wasn't angry, I appreciated the help and the thought behind their actions but I also explained why it wasn't best solution for me or my son. They didn't agree and still think they were right to do what they did and they know what I need best... 

So because of this I am struggling even more to ask for help and leave my baby with them. It will take time for me to stop stressing and overthinking and fully trust them again. I explained this to them as I can't be sure what else they could be doing opposite of what we previously agreed to and they feel very hurt saying I'm hormonal and don't understand what's best for me. I agree on being hormonal but that doesn't undo what they did. Actually I expected them to be a bit more understanding of my anxieties but it is what it is.

So AITAH for not asking for/refusing help with their grandchild anymore for some time? Am I overreacting?

61,1gqaq6e,AITA For Not Listening To My Mum When She’s Stressed At Me,"So I’ve been living away from my mum for the last few months doing a long term house sitting gig, I will be the first to admit I’ve put on weight during that period. I moved back in with my mum last Sunday and needless to say things have already returned to the status quo.

A little background, me and my mum have always had clashing personalities. As a child I was an unfocused not all that bright kid with at the time undiagnosed mild autism who just wanted to have fun all the time, whilst she was high strung, with a short fuse and wanted me to excel beyond what I could feasibly accomplish, needless to say homework sessions were hell. Meanwhile in recent years it’s turned into me being ultra laid back and calm whilst she’s still high strung and easy to stress out. Our clashing shave shifted over the years from her yelling at me overwhelming me with screamed out information and complaints whilst I cry heaps of tears, to me fighting back and arguing with her to where I am now where I just emotionally shut down and either respond to her shouting with a blunt and continuous “ok” to get her to leave me alone to giving her firm but brief statements of what I am going to do so she’ll let it go. She’s the type of person who feels her child reflects her, so many issue with my physical appearance, clothing or behaviour will trigger her and make her feel like people will look at me and judge her in the process. 

The issue in question really started last night, where I went into the kitchen in my pyjamas to show her a cute video and she instantly commented on my weight gain, I thought nothing of it at the time but this morning it continued. I woke up, saw she was in the kitchen and said “good morning” and instead of returning the greeting she instantly got on my ass and asked if I weighed myself today? I told her I hadn’t and she instantly demanded that I do because of how much weight I’ve gained. 

In that moment I did not want to weigh myself, I just wanted to relax before I got ready for work, so I declined weighing myself and tried to go back to my room, she started going off on me on the brink of tears talking about how I’m “in my own little world” and how “I’m killing myself” talking about how her father died of a heart attack and she didn’t want to see that happen to me (he smoked, I don’t so I think me and him are in different boats when it comes to our health). I go into my usual mode when it comes to stuff like this and bluntly tell her I have this handled, ignoring how distressed she was and firmly stating what I am going to do to get my weight down but she just wasn’t listening, like I find her I wouldn’t eat biscuits today at work (American translation: I won’t eat cookies) because my work stocks up on them and I do eat a few every day pick me up, her response was to just glare at me and yell “EVER!!!” to basically tell me to never eat biscuits at work again. 

My responses weren’t helping to de-escalate the situation, when u finally weighed myself she got even more stressed and eventually I just had enough, told her I want to relax in the morning and shut my bedroom door on her. I know she’s stressed out and worried about me but I can’t help but feel she’s overreacting and not treating me like an adult, this isn’t even the first time something like this has happened. I have a specific routine when it comes to getting ready for work. I wake up at 7, spent 20 minuets relaxing just to get myself mentally awake, 5 minuets to make a sandwich, 5 minuets to freshen up and then 10 minuets to get dressed, leaving me with 15 minuets to take the 3 minuet walk to the train station and wait at the station for my train to arrive. Earlier in the year though she started randomly harassing me whilst I made my sandwich trying to force me to get going earlier, insisting that I was rushing in the morning because of this (I am not) and when I kept telling her I was alright over and over again she started breaking down and saying I was really stressing her out almost begging me to change how I do it for her sake, giving these weird reasons as to why I should leave the house earlier like saying there could be a queue at the ticket booth (there never is) or the train leaves early (which it literally can’t) my routine has worked perfectly I’ve never missed the train, what did happen was her stressing out at me resulted in me going into panic mode, rushing out the house and forgetting my work laptop one time.

So the question is, am I the asshole here? I get my mum is stressed about my wellbeing but the way she goes about it just feels so self serving, I want to handle this all myself and do it my way because I don’t like her methods (her healthy food sucks and I despise it and I don’t want to be up and about the moment I wake up).

As the concert date came closer, she started to feel sick and as we are going to travel on Sunday she felt that it was better for me to go without her since she was afraid that, if it rained, her situation would get worse.

I have 2 brothers (28M and 26M) who also wanted to see the concert but were hopeless that they would find tickets anymore (since the date was so close and those tickets were so hard to get). After my gf said she wouldn't be able to go with me, I thought that this could maybe be a nice opportunity for me to invite them to come 

I tried my luck and opened the venue website and they had added probably some returned tickets back on the site, and so I bought 3 (for context, the tickets sold out in minutes when the selling started, so being able to get the tickets this way was very exciting)

I was so excited that I actually got the tickets that I went and told my gf about it and she did not like it at all that I had replaced her and that I wouldn't go alone anymore 

I didn't see it this way and now I can't tell if I was an asshole or if her response was kinda exaggerated

64,1gqa3vi,"AITAH, if I don't want to go on vacation with my friends because they try to micromanage the expenses?","I (30m) have a group of five friends from university who are around the same age as me. For the past two years, we've gone on vacation together—first to Mexico and then last year to Egypt. We've always had a great time, and we get along well. However, when it comes to sharing costs, I find myself struggling. It's not the group that has an issue; it's me who has the problem.

To provide some context, we all met at university nine years ago and have been working for the last five years. Our university was ranked number one in the country at the time (though I no longer keep track of the rankings), and we all landed jobs just a month after graduation. I mention this to illustrate that we are all financially secure; I know for a fact that each of us earns between €80,000 and €100,000 annually.

In terms of vacation costs, I typically spend around $3,000 for each trip, which is more than my friends spend since I’m more comfortable with spending. Additionally, I'm aware that the vacation money we receive amounts to at least double what any of them has spent on these trips.

So this is the problem I have: every night, they ask for a check, start checking off items for everyone, and then make that person pay exactly that amount. To me, that's embarrassing: getting nasty looks from the waitress who doesn't make in a day what these people make in an hour, waiting there for ten to fifteen minutes while they argue about who had what, and then starting to count bills and coins to pay.

I suggested we split the bill five ways, but they don't want to do that. They have mentioned that I'm the only one who drinks alcohol with dinner and that it's not fair if they have to pay extra for it. We are talking about maybe two euros. I even offered to pay more, but they still refused because some are not big eaters and don't think they should pay extra for others. It's four vs one. To make matters worse, they spent every night comparing Uber bills because, maybe I paid a couple of euros less for the ride...

So now they are planning a trip for this year, and it could be the last one as some of them want to start families, but I'm thinking of saying no, I can't do this anymore. I enjoy our trips, but getting a pay request of three euros because I had a couple of glasses of rum someone else bought at the supermarket at our hotel messes with my mood.

But I'm also the only one who has a problem with this, and I want to ask if I'm the asshole or if this is just a really strange way to handle finances.

Edit: People keep asking why we don't ask for separate checks, and the answer is that most places we visit refuse to split the bill into five. Also, some people think I want them to pay for my drinks at dinner, but I have offered to pay for my drinks, even if we split the bill.

Edit 2: People keep asking how drinking alcohol is only a couple of euros more expensive. It's because while I drink a beer or two, they drink Coke or some other soft drink. So, at the end of the day, I had two beers, and someone else had two Cokes. Yes, the beer is more expensive, but only a couple of euros compared to the Coke.

Also, some people think I'm a big eater, but I'm not the biggest eater in our friend group. I take ADHD meds, and if you use those, you know what it does with your appetite. Also, my share of the bill is always one of the lowest unless we stay long and I drink more, but again, I offered to pay for those drinks myself.

Edit 3: People keep asking why I don't pay the whole bill and then split it later. I suggested that we try it. But then that night, people started arguing about who had what, and there were items on the bill nobody said they had ordered.

65,1gq9zgs,AITA for lashing out after my partner told me to take my meds,"For the past few months, my partner and I have been moving around a lot due to financial problems, among other things. Recently, our city was hit by a typhoon causing severe flooding that drowned whole houses.  We had to stay at my sister-in-law’s for more than a week because electricity and water supply was cut off. I was grateful they took us in but I’ve been very tired from everything that happened, have not been the most comfortable here, and have been wanting to feel settled for a while especially in our new apartment. We were able move back to our apartment around a week ago but after 3 days, my SIL’s husband asked my partner if we can stay at their house again for a few days while he’s a way. (They have 2 kids and a nanny.) Probably to keep my SIL company. I didn’t mind so cut to today, we’re back in their house. Yesterday, my partner told me my SIL asked if we can extend our stay for 3 days so my partner can keep teaching her how to drive. I told her maybe just 2 days so, as an introvert, I can enjoy a full weekend in solitude. (I can’t remember the last time I felt rested, and I’ve expressed to my partner multiple times that I badly need rest and quiet.) My partner’s family has been nice to me, but as an introvert with chronic depression and anxiety, I get drained easily around them. They like to go out a lot without follow a schedule, which is fine, but most of the time it’s partners time and health that gets sacrificed. They ask her for a lot of favors, not mindful of the fact that my partner needs to rest in the morning because she works at night. She almost always end up having less than 4 hours of sleep whenever her family asks her to drive them around somewhere. And that makes me anxious for her health - and also for her work because she’s been late a few times and called out for it.  Earlier, she told me that my SIL told her there might be another typhoon, implying we might need to extend our stay further. Admittedly, I was irrationally quite upset by the possibility and quite crankily told her that I want to be back in our apartment because we’re paying so much in rent, among a few things. (It felt to me like she’s just finding another excuse because the typhoon’s not even confirmed yet.) She then, in a dismissive tone, told me to take my meds already. First of all, I already took my meds. I was taken aback by the way she said it, like I’m just being upset because I have a mental illness. But I was more horrified that she didn’t think it was wrong for her to say that and justified it further. It was very frustrating so I began to lash out.

68,1gq90sx,AITA if I don’t get my friend a gift on their birthday? ,"(27F) 

A new friend gave me a $60 visa gift card for my birthday a few months ago. I’ve known her for a few months (about 8) and she’s very sweet. I met her along side some other women and the 5 of us try to call and catch up every month or so. She also gifted another girl the same gift during her birthday so it’s not just me.

Her Birthday is next week, she lives far away so we are not celebrating together or anything. I plan to send her a nice happy birthday text.

By social rules/ etiquette am I being rude if I don’t send her anything on her birthday? I don’t know her address, and I feel like it also might be kinda lame/ passive aggressive if I also get her a gift card for the same amount. Plus I don’t want to encourage us doing this every year. I don’t really like that tbh. I liked getting the gift, but I feel pressured to get her one back. I wish she hadn’t sent so much. 

On top of that this month is a little tight for me financially (though I could still afford the gift I’d rather not rn.) January would be a much better time for me.

70,1gq87bt,AITA for asking a coworker not to talk to me if all they’re going to do is complain?,"I (22f) work in hospitality as a cook at a cafe that has about 7 employees overall. The coworker in question is a barista/ (not official in pay but in title) manager, who is always complaining to me about EVERYTHING. 

We barely have any normal conversation, and it feels like she’s using me as a sounding board to bounce her complaints off to. Her complaints, while valid, are starting to wear me down and I’m feeling less and less empathetic when she voices her complaints.

Common complaints include how annoying the boss is, how people are always coming in and she can barely get anything done because all she’s doing is is making coffee, how she doesn’t like certain customers, complaining about other coworkers. Like pretty much everything and anything she will complain about.

She’s even said verbatim ‘like, no offence but I work harder than you guys and I deserve more pay’. Which is moderately true in the sense that she’s always making coffee or doing the ordering and other stuff, but the front of house staff do work exceptionally hard and my job is slightly more technical and complicated than hers but I get less orders. She just has more responsibility overall, rather than I think does more work than us.

I’ve tried calming her down by like agreeing with her, or offering a snack and helping with the front to take some of the heat off of her. I can make coffee, so sometimes I’ll make a couple of coffees or take orders to ease the work load. I’ve even been like ‘hey, look, I get you’re upset, but I’m busy at the moment’ which makes her complain even more.

But it all came to a head last week when I was having an exceptionally hard week due to personal stuff, and she came into my kitchen, dumps the dishes as goes on a rant about how to boss is always kicking her off the coffee machine and making her do all the grunt work (which I don’t doubt since he can be a mega asshole). I was busy with my own prep and service, she’s getting worked up and it’s distracting me to the point that I just snap and say ‘if you’re just going to complain all the time, please find someone else to complain to. I’m busy’. She just huffs off.

Now she just pointedly ignores me but it’s really tense at work and it’s even more uncomfortable than it was when she was complaining, she won’t engage with me even for work stuff, I can’t even join a group convo before she’s huffing and storming off.

My other coworkers don’t usually have to listen to he complains like I do and they’re calling me a jerk for saying that to her.

I (22f) work in hospitality as a cook at a cafe that has about 7 employees overall. The coworker in question is a barista/ (not official in pay but in title) manager, who is always complaining to me about EVERYTHING. 

We barely have any normal conversation, and it feels like she’s using me as a sounding board to bounce her complaints off to. Her complaints, while valid, are starting to wear me down and I’m feeling less and less empathetic when she voices her complaints.

Common complaints include how annoying the boss is, how people are always coming in and she can barely get anything done because all she’s doing is is making coffee, how she doesn’t like certain customers, complaining about other coworkers. Like pretty much everything and anything she will complain about.

She’s even said verbatim ‘like, no offence but I work harder than you guys and I deserve more pay’. Which is moderately true in the sense that she’s always making coffee or doing the ordering and other stuff, but the front of house staff do work exceptionally hard and my job is slightly more technical and complicated than hers but I get less orders.

71,1gq851z,AITA for 'critiquing' my partners post about me when discussing the responses? ,"When I first met my partner ""P"" I was open about my friend ""F"" being someone that I had once had a casual relationship with.

F and I were just friends before and after anything sexual occurred, and it stopped happening on its own (we didn't continue until meeting other people or anything like that, we stopped and went back to just being friends).

I could tell that P wasn't super comfortable with this, but I knew they had bad previous experiences with being cheated on and also that trust is earned, so I hoped that in time (and with demonstrated faithfulness) this wouldn't be an issue.

I didn't push to maintain a friendship without P's involvement. One day a group of us went out for a drink, with P coming along and meeting these friends for the first time. P got along with some, but things with F were awkward. At one point, F was making some bawdy jokes. Not to me, just talking shit with the group at the other end of the table. P became very uncomfortable and spent the rest of the evening withdrawn and staring at the pub TV. I didn't speak up at the time because there were multiple convos happening and the jokes weren't directed at us at all so I didn't think much of it until later realising how withdrawn P had become.

After this point my friendship with F faded. We caught up one time when I returned an item that I had borrowed previously, which I discussed with P and they said it was OK, they didn't expect me to just drop it on Fs doorstep and bail without catching up for a bit. I felt that this was positive and showed trust, however any active friendship with F was pretty much in the past at this point.

Now, years later, F reaches out asking how I'm doing, hoping I'm well. I respond in kind, and F asks if I'd like to catch up. I bring it up with P before responding, letting them know that I'd like to. Thought it would be OK as we've had no issues with infidelity, and I'm sure that I've never given any signs that I would be unfaithful or anything like that.

Now the asshole moment. P posted about it on a support forum specifically for people with shitty partners. Words it as ""my partner suddenly wants to start hanging out with someone they used to sleep with, who has only ever been incredibly rude to me"". Then shows me the responses, which almost all say that I am clearly cheating, I am trash, throw me out. And now P is upset that I am ""critiquing their post"" when I point out that the wording would make me think that someone is cheating too, and the replies might be biased. I'm open to discussing the replies but I think it's a valid observation that affects the discussion.

P asked me how I would feel if it were reversed, and I told them that I would be absolutely fine with it because I trust them. P doesn't seem to believe me.

72,1gq84uf,AITA for telling my mom to only text me if necessary? ,"My fiancé (26m) works at the same company as my mom (55f). Recently, my mom and her coworker, C, told him to inform them if his work partner was bad-mouthing C or giving them undesirable tasks. My fiancé doesn’t like confrontation, especially with my mom, so I called her to explain that he didn’t want to be involved in any workplace drama, fearing it could label him a “snitch.”

My mom took offense, started yelling, and said I had no right to tell her how to do her job. I stayed calm, didn’t yell, and eventually said I’d end the call, warning her before I hung up. Needing to vent, I called my sister, who could only talk briefly, and then called my dad (56m). He disagreed with me, saying I was wrong to stand up for my fiancé and was “too young” to understand workplace dynamics. Our conversation didn’t go well.

Later, when my sister called back, I shared what happened. She was supportive and agreed that our mom didn’t have to yell. While we were talking, our mom called my sister, so I listened in. My mom misrepresented our conversation, bringing up unrelated past issues and implying that I hadn’t been fulfilling my financial obligations to her.

My fiancé and I have been paying my mom back for a recent moving expense as best as we can, given that he’s the only one working while I’m a full-time student. We’re committed to paying off the balance, but my mom falsely claimed I didn’t plan to pay her back. She also forgot that I covered all gas and food costs for another long-distance move, where she only paid for the moving van.

When the call ended, I told my sister how disappointed I was in my mom’s behavior. Afterward, my mom texted, asking me to tell my fiancé to talk to her at work. I responded, saying she should text him directly, expressed my disappointment in how our conversation had gone, and asked her only to text me if necessary. She then flooded my phone with messages about the money and accused me of acting irrationally. I replied with a lighthearted “Girl bye” and a funny gif, which didn’t go over well.

73,1gq7oar,AITA for supporting my daughter and her boyfriend?,"My daughter (17f) is in a serious relationship with a young dude (16m) to the point where they are planning to get married once they hit 18. I personally got married at 20, and know many couples who started out like this, so I have no reason to doubt their sincerity.

The guy gives off multiple green flags. He came to visit me at work, looked me in the eyes and told me how much he loves her, and has a solid plan for the future. My wife and my other kids also like him a lot. I've sat down with him for hours giving him fatherly advice and have started to see him as another son. He is extremely mature for his age.

But now it turns out, his mom is against it. Initially she told him ""do what you what, but I am against it."" Then blew up on him when he did do what he wants and kept dating my daughter. She has threatened to send him to his biological dad in Venezuela (who he has never met) and got mad at him for having talked to me. When we invited him over for dinner she allowed it, then cancelled at the last moment. Recently she has demanded that he breaks up with her, calling him immature and that he must focus on school and work.

For the record, he has had previous non-serious relationships, and she had no problems with it. But now when it's serious she is against it because he is ""being immature."" (He is being the exact opposite).

I get the impression that this is a typical case of a mom who is using her grown son as a husband-substitute, because his stepdad is apparently pretty absent. I think she is subconsciously afraid that my daughter will steal him away from her. Which I suppose is true - but it's probably also his chance to disconnect from a toxic family.

Because of his age, I feel like I must back down and respect her authority as his guardian, but I hate it. She doesn't understand that she is alienating her son, and he will most probably marry my daughter at 18 and resent his mom for life. And my daughter will live with constant in-law issues for life.

My daughter and wife are begging me to do nothing because anything I do might just make the situation worse. The mom might call me at any moment, accusing me of influencing her minor son and turn him against her (which is nonsense, he is the one who initiated contact with me, and I have always encouraged him to respect his mom even if he disagrees - at least as long as he is a minor). I begrudgingly agree, even though I am fuming at her after seeing my sweet daughter in tears (I want to destroy anyone who makes her cry).

I have broken off my contact from him because I am worried that she will sue me for contacting a minor... but his 18th birthday is in my calender... whatever happens, I will call him on that day in 2026. He is such a fine young man, and I really hope he will be able to get out of her clutches.

So, internet... AITA for supporting their relationship and hoping they make it through this time until they turn 18? Or is she right to force him to break up with her?


UPDATE: Thank you for your valuable feedback. I'm going to withdraw and mind my own business. Some of you got the wrong impression about some of the stuff here, but that's ok, there's info missing I didn't tell you.

74,1gq7mvo,AITA because I didn’t accept the “apology” of an ex friend? ,"AITA because I didn’t accept the “apology” of ex friend ?

So this happened a while back, but figured I could still ask. So forever ago my partner (M32) and I(F30) had a couple friend (M33 and F35). Point is we would constantly hang out until this happened. 
So setting the scene so we went out to dinner  (carpooled in my car) with these friends, my partner and I decided to have some drinks. Also since we were pretty close I’d let them drive my car cause I trusted them and all. My partner and I were a bit tipsy and on the way back home, a song comes up they say something about it and I’m like oh yeah I know it from so and so. They proceeded to make a comment they heard it first so they were better or whatever and I was like yeah sure lol. 

For some reason F35 proceeded to say “talk to me when you have your green card”. Now did I hear this? No I was trying to tell my partner something about something I saw outside, but I did hear her say something so I say “what did you say”. No confrontational or anything just asking and she proceededs to say oh nothing and laughs it off. I am indeed Hispanic but born and raised in the USA, so this is just strange and for one she is also Hispanic but only says she is when it benefits her. 

Nothing comes from this until I get home and my partner tells me what she said. I text her telling her “hey I didn’t think that was cool, and it wasn’t funny and I hope you don’t say stuff like that again” to which she responds to “I understand , didn’t think it was that serious it was just a joke” 

Point is I didn’t accept her apology because it honestly sounded halfassed. This became a whole issue between the friend group because I didn’t accept it and she felt bad because I didn’t accept. Was I the a hole? 

Also sorry for typos cause I know I have a pride problem and I tried thinking of maybe I was but like I did feel like it was kind of personal because I am the only one in the group that looks Hispanic everyone else passes for white.

It was mid shift when I group of older guys came in and were sat down in my section. There was one guy in particular who was eyeing me up and down right when I asked them if they wanted to start with drinks. He looked to be about 45-50 years old and was balding (we’ll call him Jeff)… immediate red flag. They all ordered margaritas and Jeff asked me if I was gonna ask for ID, I laughed and started to close up my book and walked away as I turned around he whistled at me and was holding his ID. I politely took it and gave a two second glance before handing it back. The other guys at the table seemed to be just as uncomfortable as I was. The whistling really got me going but I remained calm cause I got bills to pay and tips with these types are usually good. When I came back from with the drinks Jeff commented on my hair saying it “lays nicely on my chest” whatever that means and I didn’t know what to say. It was clear the other guys were super uncomfortable as was I. I said a polite thank you and got started on their food. Fast forward after the orders and food had made its way to the table I did my usual check in. I could hear them laughing from across the restaurant and they seemed to go quiet as I approached, I was able to make out Jeff saying watch this. When I got up to ask if everything was tasting alright Jeff looked at the guys at the table and said “it’s tasting great but can we talk about those lips are they natural if so you’ve got a perfect set of lips.” Everyone at the table and in the general vicinity went quiet because WTF like that had to be a double meaning but I was too grossed out to think of it. About 20 minutes go by without checking on them and one of Jeff’s friends signaled me for the check so I brought it over and asked the usual together or separate. Jeff insisted on paying so I handed the bill to him waited for him to finish up and thanked them for coming in. As they were leaving I saw Jeff’s friend start to put a $20 bill on the table and Jeff told him to put it away. When I looked at the check to make sure it went through I saw a big fat 0 by the tip. This is where I got a little petty but mind you I kept a very good composure the whole time I served them so I asked if there was a problem with the service. Jeff smiled and said maybe next time pull your shirt down a little or wear a smaller size. I lost it. I told him that the job was bad enough having to flaunt around like some show pony but guys like him make it even worse. I even told him that the world would be better without bald headed fucks like himself. Then I walked away. I’m not proud of it but he was just so gross. And I’m used to the occasional stares because it comes with the job I guess but this rubbed me the wrong way. Anyways I have a meeting with my boss tomorrow and I’m expecting the worst.

77,1gq78lx,AITA for planning to go to an event without permission? ,"I (18F) really want to work in the music industry after I graduate university. It’s alway been interesting and a goal of mine. In university I study communications, and would love opportunities like PR or anything in that area as a job.

Unfortunately since I don’t live in LA or New York or any city like that for example with a huge music industry, events and jobs are pretty hard to come by. However, there is one huge music conference with panels and workshops and whatnot.

Being an aspiring professional I decided to pay the $60 and attend the event, hoping to learn something. The events are early in the day, but luckily I have a reading break so I have no school this week.

I’m not really attending to get a job, but rather make connections and learn more about the industry. I told my mom I was going and she just got so mad at me.

She told me that I could not go and that I needed to focus on school. I told her I was, but she started getting mad at me and said I couldn’t go. I told her I paid for the event, but she said I would have to waste my money and not go. She said I cannot do anything without her permission and that I had no right to pay for an event without telling anyone.

I told her it could open doors for me, but she ignored me. My mom was skeptical my degree initially because she was like “it won’t get you a job” but yet she won’t let me go. My sisters who got their jobs networked the way I did and my parents bragged about it. 

My parents barely let me do anything when I’m at school, because if I’m not studying, they think I’ll fail. I told my mom I was going to attend regardless and she got super mad and told me I was being rude, and I had no right to dictate if I could go or not. 

My parents have been kind of upset because I got a part time job with asking and have called me untrustworthy, so I don’t just want to attend without their full permission. So AITA for buying a pass without asking?

Now this morning the 21 year old found that a third of the sorbet is gone and he threw a huge temper tantrum, waking the whole house up at 4 am and yelling about HIS sorbet and how dare his brother eat some of it. Then he said that because his brother ate some that means he can take the tub of vanilla and chocolate and nobody else should get any. He actually threw the whole 2 litre tub of vanilla ice cream over the fence into the neighbour's yard.

I continue to walk and she rolls her window down and I hear her say ""I know you're mother I will be talking to her"" I was a little nervous/confused but my friends told me that they: "" Highly doubt she actually knows my mom"" and ""she saying that to scare you"" I continue to walk like nothing happened. For the rest of the day I didn't even think about it once. End of school rolls around and I get picked up by my brother (17) (m) I tell him what had happened and he laughed said she should  have waited.

84,1gq6a2c,AITA for telling my roommate that his jokes are not funny?,"My roommate Andy(21M) and I(23M) have been living together for two months. We’ve been coworkers and friends for two years, and generally, I’m happy with our living situation. That being said, I recently told him I don't think his jokes are funny because I’ve noticed that he portrays things differently in private with me than in public, in ways that feels demeaning. When I brought this up, he asked for examples, and I have many from the two months we've lived together, so I gave him three.



First, when we were with a friend, Addison, Andy joked that he holds back from complaining about how dirty and messy I am because I pay more rent. This took me for a loop because I’m the one who cleans every day, sweeps, Swiffers, takes out the trash every time, and takes out the recycling almost every time. I always clean the kitchen after I eat, including doing his dishes when he has forgotten.



Another time, I was driving Andy and our coworker Danielle home, and she mentioned that Ross (who assigns us tasks) claimed I ignore his texts to avoid work. Before I could defend myself, Andy jumped in and said, “How can you expect him to respond to Ross’s texts when he never even responds to mine?” Not only did Andy not give me any benefit of the doubt with Ross' false accusation, he added another comment that was also untrue, and in the same vein. I'm very responsive to both of them.



The third example involved a care package for a coworker, Kathleen, who was out sick. It was my suggestion that we make one, I drove Andy and me to the store, and because I had a gift card, I picked out and bought every single item except a card that he got, which I had to remind him to let me sign. Later, when we delivered the package to Kathleen, he handed it to her, saying, “I don't have a cure, but I have some disposable income, so I bought you this care package!” He kept using “I,” instead of ""we"" as if he did it all alone, and with his money. 



After hearing these examples, he brushed them off as “just jokes” and said I was being too sensitive. He argued that good jokes are falsities that “take a grain of truth,” though these weren’t true at all, said to people who didn’t know it wasn't true, and he never made any attempts to correct the record. He added that he “doesn’t know a single other person who would be upset by any of this.” He apologized if I felt hurt, but he said he couldn't understand why I was hurt, which seems like an avoidance of responsibility to me. I explained that his jokes invalidate my efforts, but he said I should stop trying to ""implant the idea into \[his\] head"". He then said I was making him feel like he should never make another joke around me again.

86,1gq5uzq,AITA for how I’ve dealt with my parents buying me a house ,"I(30f) grew up with controlling parents. They have always controlled every aspect of my life even the friends I’ve made, they will insert themselves and message friends and tell them nasty things about me. (Isolating me). I didn’t go to college and I’ve never had a great paying job. I was an active alcoholic from 14-28. My parents bought a friend a house and a few years later they offered to buy me one. I really wasn’t comfortable with them buying me one when I didn’t make enough money to support myself. They ignored my protests and started working with realtors. I gave in and started going to showings with them and I always said I liked the CHEAP ones ($100kish) because I felt that was all I could afford with a monthly payment. We ended up going to a house ($260k) and it was nice but I told them I didn’t want it because I could never afford it. They told me not to worry and they would help me pay the mortgage. I agreed to this knowing I wouldn’t ask for help but that I could work OT and get a roommate. So we moved forward with buying this house. As soon as I was in it they wanted to renovate it, expensive renovations. I always protested because the house was turn key. It was ok that it wasn’t Instagram modern, it is a great house. After one year in the house a traumatic event happened inside the house, I was in the hospital for over a week and I was behind on the bills. I decided to rent it out and not live in. I have not been to the house since I moved out. It only brings me anxiety and stress and pain. 

Now it’s been about 2 years and I’m sober and successful so I can afford it. But I feel a lot of shame going back to it after my parents are the ones who bought it for me. I feel like I don’t deserve it. Like a snake using them for my own personal gain. It doesn’t help that I never admitted to anyone that they bought it for me. I just said I bought the house. How can I go back to it after never admitting they bought it for me? I also told them I plan on moving back in next month and they’re always making a list of home improvements they want to make. (New floors, new ceilings, etc.) I don’t want to do renovations. I just want stability and security and not to rock the boat.

I didn’t go to college and I’ve never had a great paying job. I was an active alcoholic from 14-28. My parents bought a friend a house and a few years later they offered to buy me one. I really wasn’t comfortable with them buying me one when I didn’t make enough money to support myself. They ignored my protests and started working with realtors. I gave in and started going to showings with them and I always said I liked the CHEAP ones ($100kish) because I felt that was all I could afford with a monthly payment. We ended up going to a house ($260k) and it was nice but I told them I didn’t want it because I could never afford it. They told me not to worry and they would help me pay the mortgage. I agreed to this knowing I wouldn’t ask for help but that I could work OT and get a roommate. So we moved forward with buying this house. As soon as I was in it they wanted to renovate it, expensive renovations. I always protested because the house was turn key. It was ok that it wasn’t Instagram modern, it is a great house. After one year in the house a traumatic event happened inside the house, I was in the hospital for over a week and I was behind on the bills. I decided to rent it out and not live in. I have not been to the house since I moved out. It only brings me anxiety and stress and pain. 

Now it’s been about 2 years and I’m sober and successful so I can afford it. But I feel a lot of shame going back to it after my parents are the ones who bought it for me. I feel like I don’t deserve it. Like a snake using them for my own personal gain. It doesn’t help that I never admitted to anyone that they bought it for me. I just said I bought the house. How can I go back to it after never admitting they bought it for me? I also told them I plan on moving back in next month and they’re always making a list of home improvements they want to make. (New floors, new ceilings, etc.) I don’t want to do renovations. I just want stability and security and not to rock the boat. So am I the asshole?",0.0,0.024546182,0,1

I gave that the hard ""nope."" I want to reward them, but I'm not about to fund what sound like nothing short of an orgy. They were NOT impressed with my decision, not in the least.

The FOH garnishes, makes smoothies, keeps the store clean, and takes orders. I do the same things, but also prep ingredients, do dishes, keep the BOH clean, and cook. The BOH duties usually take very long to complete. Even after training and working for a month, they make mistakes constantly, are frequently late, and rude to customers. This led our manager to fire G a few days ago.

The other day I was working with K and another cook. K was in the front and received an order for a peanut-butter smoothie. The smoothie itself was fine, however I and the other cook were really busy with prep and couldn't supervise her for the entire order. We lost track of the blender.

Instead of sending the blender back for sanitization, K rinsed it and kept it in the FOH. This is when another customer with a peanut allergy ordered a smoothie. K almost made the smoothie for the customer, but I noticed and stopped her from making it. I sent all the FOH dishes used for smoothies to the back for sanitization, and made the order myself.

After the customer got their smoothie I asked K why they didn't sanitize the blender. K said ""The blender looked clean so I just rinsed it"". I asked if they knew about the severity of what could have happened. They said that since the blender was ""clean"", they could serve the customer with it. I had to then explain to K the severity of peanut allergies. I spent the rest of the day supervising their work.

I reported this to my manager, who was rightfully upset at K. The manager also asked if K made any other mistakes that day, and I promptly told him about the others. 

K must've been pretty upset at me, and used my relatively few mistakes as justification for their own. For example, I was running really late the other day due to an injury from the gym and K used that as an excuse to justify her being late all the time. This behavior continued behind my back for a bit.

This all culminated into today, after I discovered that I was K's scapegoat. I asked K about the issue, and they thought that I was the reason that they were receiving reduced hours, thinking that I was purposefully talking ill of their performance because they were Indian, calling me a racist and blaming me for G's departure (who was also Indian). This made me upset.

I cussed K out. I reprimanded them for their negligence and pointed out that for everything K criticized me for, they have done so worse. I told K that I don't make the decisions on who is fired and to not call me racist. I told K that I would be bringing this up to the manager.

K started tearing up and saying that they needed this job, that they ""knew"" every point that I was saying and would fix their mistakes. I said that if they really cared for their job, then to focus on their performance and not blame me.

I have people pleasing tendencies and the relationship I'd with my ex turned me into a person who's more angrier/assertive over the years. I am dealing with horrible stuff over custody and child support and I feel I am just being used and the guy despite knowing that I am dealing with personal stuff doesn't seem to have a problem staying for another 6months if I weren't broaching the subject with him and being stern a few days back. 

Please let me know what you'll think as I just like my own personal space in general and avoids people most of the time outside of office work.

A few nights a week there are some kids/teenagers (I’m assuming because I don’t see why adults would do this) that sit at the dead end road that stops right in front of our home for 2+ hrs. We never seen them, as they mostly come around anywhere between 8-10pm est. we have no clue what they are up to, we assumed maybe they were kids that smoke trying to hide from their parents but sometimes they’ll pull in 2-4 cars deep and the others will get out of their cars and join the one person that drives the newer car and they just sit there and get back in their car a few hrs later and leave. I guess it wouldn’t be a problem if they weren’t there so long but the longevity makes it seem sketchy tbh. We live in a pretty high crime city but our particular neighborhood is safe compared to the rest of the city. It would make me feel better if they would at least let me know what they are up to so I don’t feel the need to call the cops. I don’t even know if I could call them, as they aren’t breaking any laws just sitting there i guess lol and they aren’t on my property but on the road right in front of it facing my home lol(I know they aren’t obligated to tell me anything, it’s a free country).

96,1gq3vw4,AITA for being distant and not visiting my best friend?,"At the beginning of summer, my (19F) best friend G (19F) started dating a great guy. She had a rough breakup six months earlier and needed a lot of support, so I was cautious but supportive. They decided to try long-distance when he moved 10 hours away for school in the fall. A few weeks later, G decided impulsively to apply to the same school and move in with him. I was worried and sad to see her go, but she assured me it would work out and that we’d visit each other.

Since she moved, it’s been hard to keep in touch. I always answer her calls and texts, but I’ve been bad at reaching out on my own. I’m going through a tough time with seasonal depression, recent unemployment, and trying to get my license. Most of my energy goes toward finding a job, helping at home, and managing my mental health.

G has asked me a few times to come visit, but I’ve explained that I don’t have the money or energy for a trip like that. Recently, my other friends and I planned to drive down, but one friend couldn’t afford it, and since I don’t drive, another friend would have had to drive the entire 10 hours herself, which we all agreed was unsafe. So we had to cancel.

I’m careful about spending since I have little to spare, but G is more impulsive and seems to think I’m just cheap or making excuses. I worry that she doesn’t fully understand my financial or mental health situation.

I was also recently in a relationship with a guy who didn’t quite understand my depression. I explained I didn’t have the energy to constantly text or meet up, but he struggled with my boundaries. We took a break to avoid hurt feelings, but G has sided with him, saying I’m “mean” to him and that I'm the same way to her and she “gives and gives and gets nothing back” from me, which I found unfair. She recently spoke to another friend and admitted that she believes this because I don’t spend money on her and that I’ve been distant/cold. We plan to talk about it when she’s in town.

I’ve always supported G through her highs and lows, and I love being someone she can lean on. I don't often open up to much because I prefer to be private and don’t want to burden anyone, but she knows that I struggle a lot with depression. For the first time, I’m prioritizing my own well-being, but instead of understanding, she’s making me feel selfish and avoidant. I’m starting to question if I am.

97,1gq3ctm,AITA of not supporting my friend dream of being an exotic dancer?,"I (24F) have a friend we’ll call A (25M). We’re both med students, and A is one of the kindest people I know. We've been best friends since childhood. He’s also doing really well in school, so it came as a surprise when he told me he hopes to become a stripper. I honestly didn’t know how to respond.

First off, I’m genuinely worried for him. A is such a kind-hearted person and often struggles with saying no, so I’m afraid he could easily get taken advantage of. I'm not religious, but the stripping industry just goes against my morals, and I’ve always thought of it as an unhealthy environment. It feels like a job that can be pretty exploitative, and I’m worried it could affect his well-being in ways he hasn’t thought about.

Another part of me wonders if this is really about wanting to be a stripper, or if it’s more about something else. A has always been looking for deeper connections with men and has faced a lot of rejection, which I know has taken a toll on him. This might be his way of seeking validation, or maybe just finding a place where he feels seen and wanted. I feel for him, but I can’t shake the concern that he’s choosing this path for the wrong reasons, or at least reasons that might lead him to get hurt.

I tried sharing my feelings with him, but he got really defensive and even accused me of laughing at kids with illnesses (which I’ve never done—I’m literally studying to be a doctor. he pulled this out of thin air to try and paint me like a horrible person). He said I’d get canceled online and that I was a bad friend for making him feel ashamed about his dreams, which was not at all my intention. I truly wasn’t trying to offend him; I just want him to stay on a better and safer path.

After this I confided in one of our mutual friends because I felt as though they could try and talk some sense into him. Through this, his sister also found out. Also, his sister has not told their parents yet because she wants to talk with him first. They are fully against this, seeing that there is no reason for him to pursue this type of career. However, A found out, since his sister tried to reason with him about switching to this career path. Now everything is tense. He's blocked me and his sister on everything.

I’m seriously considering telling his parents. They believe he’s working toward a future as a doctor, and they’re actually paying for all his college expenses. I think they deserve to know if he’s planning to go in a completely different direction. Meanwhile, A is upset at me and our mutual friend because he believes I ruined his friendships and dreams.

I’ve lived in this house for a couple months now, and have noticed that nobody else seems to do any of the household maintenance tasks except me.

Last night, I mentioned to one of my housemates that we need to make a chores rota since I am feeling the burden of these domestic tasks and ultimately, they aren’t my sole responsibility.
I feel like by assigning everyone chores, I am assuming a position of authority that I don’t really want but at the same time it is the only way to lessen my own burden. I have also tried gently mentioning or asking people to take the bins out, clean up etc., which they are always agreeing to do, but then never do them.
There have also been times where I have emptied the bin, not put in another bin bag due to being distracted or in a rush and then people put rubbish in the bin without a bag. I feel like making people do the chores will make them realise how all these seemingly minor inconveniences are actually not very nice to actually deal with.
I’m also getting busier now since assignment deadlines get closer and I have picked up extra curriculars, so I would like the house to not be a mess.

101,1gq1gpm,AITA for leaving home,"For 1.5yrs I (22) was living in Edmonton, Alberta Canada for school. My intentions were to make Edmonton my home especially after making some genuine friends for the first time in my life. One day at the end of June, I was admitted to the hospital for almost dying of an epileptic seizure and was there for 3 days in which my closest friends of my friend group came and visited me for up to an hour each day. On the 3rd day my parents unexpectedly walked into my room while my 2 best friends were there and discharged me. When I walked out of the hospital with my parents to my mom’s car, I saw all of my things packed up into the trunk and back seat. I immediately knew that she was driving me back home to Kelowna, BC. A week after getting back my mom set up counselling for me, which at first I hated it but realized I liked it since it got me away from her. Growing up and even still now, my mom is manipulative and mentally abusive and treats me lesser than my sister because of her doing way better in school, getting A’s and B’s and rarely ever getting any C’s, where as when I was in high school the only time I got an A or a B was in PE or dance class since that was an option. My sister also does a bunch of volunteering, goes to church and recently won vis ambassador in the West Kelowna ambassador pageant, for winning such title she gets ti travel BC. My sister pretty much set the bar for the type of kid my mom wanted the first 2 times, but neither me or my older sister gave that. I became very depressed, so when August arrived I paid for a plane ticket for September 10th and very slowly packed things that no one would notice, then the night before I packed the noticeable stuff. I paid for a ticket at a time in which my mom would still be at work when I leave since she works nights. The earliest flight wasn’t til 8:30-9ish AM, and since I couldn’t afford uber to the airport, I had to bus which took 1.5hrs to get to there, so I left at 6am which was 30mins before my mom gets off work.

Elry went completely quite, Jesse had a slightly cold shoulder at me, Elry ended up taking me home but as we were getting down the stairs Jesse said i definitely wasn't coming over again, in a joking way but truth to it as Elry took me home, fell asleep immediately. woke up Sunday and nothing changed, it still hurt, stayed at home, embarrassment and shame was to much, after a day or two i texted Elry apologizing if i ruined he's night, and he said i should be apologizing to Jesse for ruining her birthday, i soon after texted her telling her what happened and how sorry i was, she didn't respond for a while before saying thank you, but she was still hurt really. I admit i was a little too active that night, happy to get out of such a sad state, and i broke her gift which i didn't mean to, but i didn't realize how much it would hurt her and my friends, there amazing and our friendship means the world to me, and its been eating me up for days, i went to the orthopedic doctor and i wont be walking, at least normally or running for a while, which hurt even more as i have a passion for Drum corps (Basically the NFL but for Marching Band)

Elry went completely quite, Jesse had a slightly cold shoulder at me, Elry ended up taking me home but as we were getting down the stairs Jesse said i definitely wasn't coming over again, in a joking way but truth to it as Elry took me home, fell asleep immediately. woke up Sunday and nothing changed, it still hurt, stayed at home, embarrassment and shame was to much, after a day or two i texted Elry apologizing if i ruined he's night, and he said i should be apologizing to Jesse for ruining her birthday, i soon after texted her telling her what happened and how sorry i was, she didn't respond for a while before saying thank you, but she was still hurt really. I admit i was a little too active that night, happy to get out of such a sad state, and i broke her gift which i didn't mean to, but i didn't realize how much it would hurt her and my friends, there amazing and our friendship means the world to me, and its been eating me up for days, i went to the orthopedic doctor and i wont be walking, at least normally or running for a while, which hurt even more as i have a passion for Drum corps (Basically the NFL but for Marching Band) 

TL;DR come to party after funeral, accidently dislocated leg and fell on friends lamp, ruined her birthday party, friends are all mad at me, i cant walk normally anymore

103,1gq1cpz,AITA for yelling at my daughter ,"Okay. I'm going to be honest, this seems horrible right off the top of me writing it, but I need some advice from other parties that might be able to relate or give insight.

I, 37M, have a daughter, 16F.  I've always tried my best to be a supportive father even through co-parenting. I've been her sole caretaker since she was 10 years of age and I love her to death. The problem is she keeps things from me. And I mean EVERYTHING. I have no problem with that. She values her privacy and I value mine but there's just a point that makes me think like ""Okay? And why couldn't you tell me that sooner?"". 

Recently the incident that sparked the argument between me and her was finding out she was gay. Now I have no problem whatsoever with anyone of the LGBT community, I just don't support it. I don't hate them, they're humans just like us. I found out through an Instagram post with the caption ""Me and my pookie forever"" or something and it was another girl hugging and kissing her on the cheek. Was I angry? Heck yeah. She could've told me this sooner. She's my daughter. I'm starting to feel like I'm just the guy that helps her with her homework and makes her food and buys her stuff instead of her father. It hurt me so much just looking at that picture. What really am I to her?

I waited until she got home to confront her about it. The anger was visible on my face and I could tell she knew the atmosphere was tight the moment she walked in to the door. I immediately showed her the picture asking what was this. She tried playing it off saying ""Oh it's joke"" and stuff like that but she's a horrible liar. I asked her again, I was getting angrier each time she continued lying. Finally my voice raised and I could hear it echo through our home. I could tell she was stunned for a few seconds before she immediately started yelling at me back. She admitted to me that ""she did like girls"" and she started saying that ""I'm never there for her"" and that ""I don't understand her"" and ""You have no idea what's going on in her life"". It honestly broke my heart into pieces. I felt like she hated me. The words pierced my heart and I felt pain all in my body. She stormed off into her room and now she won't talk to me.

I understand why she's angry at me. She knows that I don't support the community and I could see how that would be hard telling me that, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't support her (Maybe I need to stop being so closed minded?). I try my best buying her all of the clothes she wants (She is alternative (something along the lines of emo I think?)) and I try doing everything in her favor but it hurts so much that she just doesn't trust me or tells me anything. I feel so bad for raising my voice at her and it's been draining the happiness out of me having her mad at me. 

I just need help to see if I was in the wrong in this situation because I feel like I am.

EDIT: I wasn't/am not mad at her for being apart of the lgbtq community, I was mad at the lack of trust and communication she has in me. My anger boiled over when it was something as important as that and she didn't tell me.

It's been two months, I have had one day off . Now I don't mind hard work and we split the profit 50/50. But most days I'm giving him MY money, a bunch of little things that add up to a lot over the weeks. Now I've been nice about all the stuff he puts me through and everyone can see that I'm doing 99% of the actual work because Steve is off talking on the phone . There's a lot more I could list but I wont.
  Yesterday I went home early to go run errands with my wife because she needed help with stuff, we didn't have any jobs today but Steve said he wanted me to go with him three hours away to go pick up a used truck for his girlfriend, I never agreed to that, so I left . He asked when I was coming back, and I texted him saying "" sry is there any way your girl can go with you ? I'm still helping my wife.""

106,1gq0kq7,AITA for skipping the queue and using the toilet for disabled people?,"Hi, everyone! I will start this post by clarifying that I have no diagnosis that would be considered a disability.

During summer I went to a rather large outdoor event (+200k people, spread on a wide surface). The event was a few days long and during daytime in southern Europe, hence the temperatures would get really high. As the event was outdoors, the toilets available were porta potties. The standard ones were quite small, without proper ventilation, making them terribly hot, while the ones for people with special needs were double the size of a normal one.

Unfortunately, I was on my period during the event. I usually get very sick during that time, having cramps, and hot flashes that make me having trouble breathing. These symptoms only got worse during those days due to the heat and the 2.5km walk through a field with no shadow to the event. I also have micro fractures in my knee ligaments which are not usually an issue, however, they sometimes cause great pain. My period, alongside humidity, are often the catalysts for these pain. I was aware of the symptoms I would have during the event, however I decided to go to the event anyway as I got the tickets almost a year in advance and they were rather difficult to obtain.

Back to the main story, during the event I found myself needing to use the bathroom during a break. Hence, the toilets were quite busy. As I have attempted to use the standard toilets before and the lack of air in them with my hot flashes caused me to get even sicker and feel like I have little to no air to breath, and my knees would have been put under quite a lot of strain due to the lack of space, which I tried to avoid as they were giving me signs that they were one mistake away from a pain crisis, I decided to directly use the special needs toilet, hence skipping a queue of 25-30 people (none of them going to the special needs ones that were empty). A few people looked weirdly at me, but didn’t say anything.

Fast forward to a few days ago, I mentioned this incident to my flatmate during a discussion about the facilities at the event venue. They told me I was a huge AS and that what I did was very wrong and immoral. Since then, they keep hinting at it. While I didn’t feel bad initially, now I start to doubt myself as my friend makes a huge deal out of it. So, AITA?

107,1gq046j,WIBTA for confronting my stepmom about her new husband?,"Backstory:  

My(32f) parents divorced when I was very young. My dad retained full custody of all 3 kids and kept the house which had been in my mom's family since the 1800s. My dad remarried & had 2 more kids.

My dad & stepmom (SM) were married for 20+yrs when he passed away unexpectedly 1.5yrs ago. Shortly after he passed, SM asked another sibling & myself if we would be interested in buying the property cuz it's too big to take care of herself & to keep it in our family. Sibling doesn't want it and I always have. The plan was for SM to keep a portion of the land that a small house would be built on for her & my adult disabled sibling (DS) to live in. 

DS is fully dependent & when the time comes that SM is no longer able to take care of DS I will become their guardian and caretaker. So my obtaining the main house will also help with that some day transition for DS.

Between everyone grieving & logistics it was understood that these plans would not be started particularly soon.

My problem:

SM (54) remarried less than a year after my dad passed to a man (53ish) she knew for less than a month. Reasons for the rushed wedding?

1. After 2wks of dating he was already staying at the house ""while he looks for another place to live because he's being bullied by his current roommates"" but since he was a deacon or something at his church ""it could cost him his position in the church if they found out he was living in sin"".

2. They both have so much in common, including being long term recovering alcoholics.

It's ""just a coincidence"" that less than a month after they got married he stopped attending his church all together & we could tell he was drinking excessively & frequently. SM says he'll be kicked out if he doesn't stop.

SM says she still intends for my family to get the house. BUT she's allowed the new husband to make & plan long term changes to the property. One being digging up the yard because HE NEEDS a new brick patio for a fire ring despite there being preexisting foundation slabs from where various out buildings once stood.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but you wouldn't put the amount of time and effort that he has into someplace that you didn't plan on keeping. 

I whole heartedly believe that I will not be able to get my childhood home so long as he is in the picture. With how quickly he took to making the property changes in addition to his earlier ""coincidences"" I can't help but feel like maybe he's been intentionally taking advantage of SM from the beginning. He found a vulnerable widow with a big property and a lot of health issues. If she should pass before him, he could argue a claim for the property as her husband.

 I've been thinking about bringing up these concerns with SM but am afraid it could be perceived that I just want the house.

108,1gpzwye,AITA For not inviting my parents to my wedding?,"I (20F) got engaged to my lovely fiancé (21F) last November. We had been dating for 8 years at that point and it came as a surprise to no one when we got engaged. At the time I was in college and still living with my parents and she was living on her own. Since we've gotten engaged, she came out to me as a trans woman. I had absolutely no problem with this since I am a queer woman but my family and my parents are very conservative, they absolutely do not support queer folks in any way and have expressed to me on multiple occasions that this is just a phase and they do not support my decision to marry her.
In March, I contracted a stomach ulcer from stress (note that I am 20 years old), had to quit college and my job due to the stomach ulcer. My parents (70M & 66F) absolutely did not support me during this time and to be honest, haven't been there for me at all since middle school. They then kicked me out of my childhood home during one of the worst lows I've had in my life and offered me no semblance of support. Things are not going well for me financially, physically or mentally so we've had to postpone the wedding. I had 1,800 dollars saved up for it and it's gone now. Whether or not they kicked me out because I was marrying a trans woman, I'm not sure. But I have a feeling it has something to do with it.

This being said, I'm still planning on having a wedding and they are expecting me to invite them and the rest of the family. To be honest I don't feel comfortable inviting them since they continue to misgender and deadname my fiancé to the point where she is uncomfortable being around them and refuses to go to their house. I still love my parents but since most of my found family is queer, I can't guarantee no drama from them or the family on my wedding. My dad and I are somewhat close and I've always dreamed of our father daughter dance at my wedding but I'm unsure that it will happen. I worry I will regret not inviting them.

TLDR Should I invite my parents to my wedding despite them not supporting my marriage?

EDITS FOR QUESTIONS AND CONTEXT:

- I'm closer to my dad than my mom, he basically raised me since my mom passed when I was 10. I owe him a lot, hence feeling obligated to invite him at the very least. Not to mention extended family that have been in my life since I was small. 
- We had an agreement that I would be able to live in the house until I was done with college or decided to move out. Me being an adult had nothing to do with me being kicked out (as far as I'm aware). I was a broke college student and the job market is shit, give me a break. 
- YES this is a REAL situation that I'm living.
- The doctor at Urgent Care didn't give me a reason for the ulcer, just gave me some meds 🫡. I threw up every day for a month and a half (as well as other terrible symptoms), it was horrible.

Me and my wife went out for our anniversary Saturday and my Aunt was watching the kids. My wife wasn't feeling well and we decided to call it an early night and I forgot to call my Aunt before we got there... I pull up and I notice my parents car. Confused we get out and go in and theirs my parents playing with my son's in the living room.


To say I was furious is an understatement. I immediately asked what the hell is going on. My wife tried to calm me down to no avail.. She takes the boys to the car.. My parents start talking about how they just wanted to meet them and I yell at them to get out. My Aunt says I'm not being fair to them. That they've tried to apologize for what happened.. I yell at her that it wasn't her place to let them and how it hurt seeing them.. I yell at her about how our family basically excommunicated her when she came out. She starts crying explaining that they just showed up at he house.she starts saying she wished she made up with her brother( my dad) and my grandparents years ago if she had the chance and I'm being selfish knowing my dad is dying. I didn't know what to say after that and just left. My wife says I was being unfair to my Aunt if they did just show up and that maybe my Aunts right. She also thinks I shouldny have yelled at her like that after all she did for me ..AITA here?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-13,"AITA for yelling at my Aunt after she let my parents see my kids?
