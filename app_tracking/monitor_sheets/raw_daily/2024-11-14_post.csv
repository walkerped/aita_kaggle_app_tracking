0,1grf1a8,AITA for not giving back my finances deceased grandmothers engagement ring?,"Throwaway account. I 29 female am engaged to Jake 32, male. We have been engaged for 2 years. He has an older brother, Sam 38. 

When Jake and I got engaged Jake wanted me to have his grandmothers engagement ring. Jake talked to Sam and Sam said since he doesn’t plan to get married or have children that Jake should use the ring. 

I love that ring and love the sentimental meaning behind it. Sam met a wonderful woman, Hannah, within the past year and they are expecting a child. Once they found out it would be a girl Hannah told Sam she wants him to get the ring back for their daughter. 

Jake has already told Sam no. 

During Sunday dinner last weekend at my mother in laws house Hannah brought up the ring and how it should be given to their daughter since she would a great grandchild and I am not related by blood. It became an intense discussion. Luckily my mother in law also agrees with my fiance and I. 

Hannah then asked if her daughter could have it in our will. I said no because it will either be given to our son or our future daughter. I told Hannah to take up her problem with Sam since he’s the one who let Jake have the ring to give to me.

2,1grdu2u,AITAH FOR NOT GIVING UP MY MMJ COLD TURKEY JUST BECAUSE MY HUSBAND DID?,"My husband (M28) and I (F26) recently got married. We've been together for 11 years now and have been smoking for about 10 of those years. He started smoking when he was around 13 and I started after we met. It started as on and off mostly when we could get it and then once I turned 18 and we got our own place over the years it became a daily thing for us. Up until about 4 months ago we were chronic daily smokers before work, after, work and in between. Our tolerance was very high so we were spending about 500 on average a month (we both have our MMJ card). 

My husband lost his job in July and between the financial situation and us needing so much to even get a buzz we opted to stop smoking. I never wanted it to be permanent I merely wanted a T break. I have ADHD, Anxiety w/Panic Attacks and I'm on the spectrum. I've tried meds and learned years ago the MMJ is extremely helpful for me. He has his own reasons for giving it up such as wanting his guns back and certain jobs he's interested in still won't allow you to have the MMJ card. He feels he will be stuck with a less then ideal job making a terrible wage if he smokes. 

He also told me that I'm different since I stopped smoking and that we can have conversations and not argue. I struggle in general when conversing I get very overwhelmed (grew up in a verbally abusive home). We haven't argued other than minor things since we stopped smoking but during this time he was also jobless and depressed so I tried very hard not to argue (he's tried committing a few times). 

Now we are in a rather tense situation because he's saying he doesn't care if I smoke but he gets infuriated smelling it or being around it. He got a gym membership and told me to tell him my smoke plans so he can leave the apartment. He says he voiced his concerns but no one cares so I can do what I want. Which I know him very well and know it bothers him. I'd also like to mention that when we stopped smoking he started drinking and I brought that up and asked how it was ok to do that but you get mad about smoking. He threw the rest of the liquor away and told me he's done drinking too. I'm just lost on how to feel bcuz I'm being made to feel selfish and an asshole in this situation.

**Just wanted to clarify that I use a smoke buddy and try my hardest to make it not smell.

My house is currently under renovation. My sister and I are living in different rooms. Today, her room only got repainting done, which left an uncomfortable smell of paint and led me thinking that she might want to sleep somewhere else, like my room, for the night. 

I offered her that as soon as she got back home around 11pm, and she agreed. 

Because tomorrow, my room will be done next, I got 2 items on my bed (backpack and a bag of necessities) lying on the rear side of the bed. When my sister went into my room, she also sat by the rear side of the bed doing her thing, while I was working on school assignments. After about an hour, I decided to take a short nap/break before continuing working on the assignments. That was when I headed to the bed and lied down. 

After that nap, I woke up. My sister got upset that I didn't make space for her to sleep. I was kind of dumbfounded, because there were 2 reasons. My bed had enough space for the 2 of us. Before the renovation, there was a time when I had to stay in her room. I was the one who had to ask her which side of the bed would she like to sleep on. Now, she got upset or mad that I did not make an effort to do that. Her reasons were: 

1) I did not make space for her on the bed = I don't want her to sleep in my room 
2) the situation before was much more different than this, and the way I handled it was inappropriate. Before, there was nothing on the bed, while this time, there were my 2 things on the bed. Additionally, she told me that I was aware of staying in her room in the old situation, and this time, she got a last minute offer.

For some context, I (18F) left my country to go to Uni a few months ago and that's where I met my friend Maria (fake name) 19F. She and I immediately clicked but one thing that always bothered me in her personality is that she always feel the need to touch people. I don't like that for personal reasons and made it clear several times that she stops for a few days and starts again because she ""forgot"". 

Now to the actual problem: Last Tuesday, I wasn't feeling ok (because I was trying to find a way to ask her, again, to give me some space from a physical pov without being rude or mean) so I kept to myself and her attitude just made me feel overwhelmed. I barely spoke to her during our class and as soon as we got out, I put on my earphones to listen to my music. She tried to talk to me but I immediately told her that I didn't wanna talk and intentionally left a different way because I didn't wanted to be mean. About 4/5 minutes later, I saw her again in front of our uni (which makes sense because we had a class together) and just hoped that she would leave me alone. She did not. In fact, she started walking next to me, so close that I could feel her shoulder against mine. I slow down, she slows down, I speed up, she speeds up. To go to the building where we had our class there are 2 different ways: Take the stairs and go around the building from the left or go straight and go around the building from the right. I always go straightforward and she always takes the stairs, but I noticed that she didn't seem to walk towards the stairs, so I slowed down and went towards the stairs from behind her, and she followed me. So I changed my route again and took a few steps back to the direction I usually go, she followed me once again. I was honestly pissed that she wouldn't leave me alone so I took out one of my earphones and said ""Can't you just leave me alone??"" before walking away without listening to her answer.

Later that night, I sent her a text where I calmly explained (once again) why I didn't wanted to be touch and why I reacted like this, she left me on open and didn't answered until this morning with a text in which she basically blames me for everything and asks for an apologie.

I dont believe I am in the wrong for asking her to respect my boundaries and I believe I stayed polite (maybe a bit cold) in the text I sent her.

I (17m) am an autistic introvert. that means I love and I mean *love* my alone time. When I’m alone I tend to act out scenes with music from my favorite shows and movies, talk to myself out loud, etc etc. 

Today was supposed to be one of those days where I get that alone me time for 2 and a half hours. My mum and sister go to jujitsu at this time. However, today, my sister said she didn’t want to go so after forty minutes they came home without warning. Without texting or calling me first so I had my headphones at full volume, dancing. They rang the doorbell and it took me a few minutes to answer because I didn’t hear them. My mum scolded me for that. When I asked them why they were home, mum said “because we didn’t want to go.” 

Now I’ll admit, I had several issues with this whole situation. 
1. My sister had skipped that session for weeks now just cause “she didn’t want to go.” 
2. They didn’t warn me before hand, ruining my alone time that I cherish to much.
3. My mum got mad at me for having my headphones in. 

I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS ALONE MUM. What does she think a teenager my age does if not have their headphones at max volume, let’s be honest here. 😭

So, my reaction to all of this information happening all at once was to, well, start crying and, without saying anything because i didn’t want to start yelling, get my coat and leave. 

After like an hour, I came home and my mum started yelling about how I’m overreacting and I’m “so sensitive” and “it’s not that big of a deal” 

My mum is actually a really cool and chill mum most of the time, so her yelling scares the fuck out of me so I didn’t say anything back. 

Now I’m sitting in my room, genuinely wondering that maybe she’s right and I shouldn’t have reacted like that.

My best friend is also unemployed and had time so I asked him to go on a trip with me to see the match since we both can take those days.

The thing is, I didn't ask my GF first if she wanted to go because I knew she had to work and assumed she couldn't do the trip without asking for days off which at the moment she can't take.

When I told her she got upset and after asking a few times she told me it bothered her that I didn't ask her first if she wanted to go with me. She told me that even if it's true that she could not go I should have asked her if she wanted to go first, instead of going directly to my best friend.

The thing is, I didn't ask my GF first if she wanted to go because I knew she had to work and assumed she couldn't do the trip without asking for days off which at the moment she can't take.

When I told her she got upset and after asking a few times she told me it bothered her that I didn't ask her first if she wanted to go with me. She told me that even if it's true that she could not go I should have asked her if she wanted to go first, instead of going directly to my best friend.

So... AITA?",3.0,1.0574194,1,0
9,1grc8a6,AITA for not giving my late husband’s mom any of the life insurance money after she paid for his funeral?,"My first and hopefully last throwaway account. 

My husband and I were both in our early 40s, married for 6 years, when he passed away suddenly a few months ago. It’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever faced, and honestly, I’ve just been trying to survive each day since. Right after he died, his mom (my MIL) stepped in and insisted on paying for all the funeral expenses. I was completely out of it, just in a fog, and really grateful for the help.

Here’s the thing: I totally forgot that my husband had a small life insurance policy through my job. I only remembered it recently and filed a claim, getting a payout. It’s not a huge amount of money, but enough to help me move back across the country to be with my family and maybe put something down on a modest home so I can start over.

When my MIL found out about the insurance payout, she flipped out. She’s demanding I pay her back for the funeral costs and accusing me of ‘using’ her son. She’s said some really hurtful things, calling me selfish and implying I’m somehow profiting off his death. But she offered to pay for the funeral, and I truly didn’t know about the insurance money at the time. I’m still so broken over losing him, and the thought of being called heartless just adds to the pain.

I know she’s grieving too, but I’m trying to do what’s best for me to heal and move forward. So, AITA if I don’t give her the money? I’m already barely holding it together and just need a chance to rebuild my life.

I’m ready, I hope- to handle the criticism that may be coming my way. ",Everyone Sucks,2024-11-14,"AITA for not giving my late husband’s mom any of the life insurance money after she paid for his funeral? My first and hopefully last throwaway account.

10,1grbupm,"WIBTA if I wanted to got to my sister's wedding leaving my (33F) wife and 3 kids (11, 7 and 2) alone for 4 days?","
My sister's wedding is coming up, and I want to go, but my wife doesn't. She doesn't have a great relationship with my family, and while everyone is polite and cordial when they meet, a lot of issues have happened in the past. My wife really doesn't want to deal with any more issues that might come up at the wedding. We have three kids and live in a different country.

I've asked my wife if it's okay for me to go for five days - pre-wedding plus the actual wedding, as I am the eldest and this is the last wedding in my family. My dad also passed a couple of years back, so I kind of have the mantle passed on as the lead of the family. She was not okay with this and said that she can maybe look after the kids for a couple of days but not more than that.
we cannot get any support here as we dont have family and apart from school, the kids would be at home with the wife.

The five days have now come down to four - I can go for the two days of the actual wedding and then come back, but me being there for the four days would mean a lot to my mum. I asked my wife again, and she doesn't want to talk about it as she gets stressed when I bring my family up. I am feeling quite indecisive and frustrated as I cannot make a decision without hurting people in my life. 

UPDATE: thanks for all the feedback. Some very useful comments and advice. to give more context, yes I am willing to take the kids even all 3 with me. However, my wife is not ok with that. My family and wife are on speaking and even visiting terms, however, my extended family - aunts, uncles and cousins - are not someone my wife wants to really bond with. They would be at the wedding which is a major reason my wife doesnt want to really go. None of the kids are special needs and yes my first 2 are independant and can help out. My wife is quite amazing and understanding in a lot of things but we always conflict when it comes to my family. I have been trying to be supportive of her but she is not willing to let go of past transgressions which was mostly fueled by my moms siblings and their kids which caused a lot of friction. 

I should have stepped up more and supported her more which I am trying to do. I am ok for her to come with the kids and stay over at her parents while I go to the wedding but she is not ok with this as well coz it would further create problems with her family and mine as well.

sorry for not providing updates sooner. I will update once I make a final decision. I tried to have a conversation which turned into a fighting match with us not speaking in the end.

11,1grbmlq,AITA for moving in with my boyfriend and his roommate with my cat?,"I (23M) recently moved from Texas to New York to live with my boyfriend (22M) and his roommate (22F), who is a close friend of his. My boyfriend moved to New York first, and a few weeks later, I joined him. Initially, we had planned to do long-distance, but after I visited and given our circumstances, we decided it made sense for me to move in with him and his roommate.

His roommate was initially cool with it and even excited for him that his partner would be moving in. When I moved, I left my cat back in Texas with friends who are taking care of her while I got settled in. My plan was to fly back during the holidays and bring her to New York.

However, our roommate has now made it clear that she doesn’t want my cat living with us because she “didn’t sign up to live with a cat.” This has been really hard for me because my cat has been with me for 4 years, and she’s a huge part of my emotional and mental well-being.

For context, my cat is pretty much the dream pet. She’s an adopted miniature Persian, quiet, small (around 6 lbs), and very friendly. She’s hypoallergenic, rarely sheds, and never bites or scratches. I even bathe her every 1–2 weeks. She’s truly the best.

I would understand if my roommate had an allergy or a specific issue with cats, but she hasn’t given me any reason besides that she doesn’t want to live with a cat. Meanwhile, she’s been talking about getting a dog, which feels like a double standard.

This situation has started putting strain on my relationship with my boyfriend, as I can’t imagine not living with my cat long-term. I also feel like my roommate isn’t being considerate, especially since she was okay with me moving in (which she didn’t “sign up for” either). I’m starting to think that if she sticks to this no-cat boundary, we shouldn’t renew the lease with her next year, but that could affect my boyfriend’s friendship with her.

At the time I was in a reasonable career, together we earned approx £50ish k between us.  We have always split the rent proportionally (% based on total household income vs your income so it doesn’t impact us unfairly). 

I changed careers and started in a different field. I’m now on less money (£18k) whereas she has continued in her field and is now on approx 45k. 

As part of my career I’ve had to move out to attend training in a nearby city. I get a stipend to cover part of the rent there and I go home for weekends. I’ve paid my share at her flat as it’s approx a week of the month total that I’m there

Well now I’m having to go abroad for a few months as part of my job. She wants me to pay more money as I’m not paying rent for my flat as I’m deployed.  The issue is she wants to pay the rent agreement we’ve had in the past. Which means I’m paying rent for both her flat and my own. This would mean I’m paying the total amount that I’d be paying if I stayed at her flat full time as well as paying my own bills in my flat. 

I don’t mind contributing some money to the flat as we have pets but I feel conflicted paying the full amount even though I won’t be there at all. 

She feels she’s being punished for earning more money if I pay less. She thinks that we should be a family and I’m not seeing us as a unit. She feels that if I’m not paying while I’m training why would I pay when I’m fully qualified (when I’m on more than double current wage but still away from home to work most of the year). While I see her concern I think these are different as I’m having to pay double rent on current income whereas I’d only be paying one rent on more. 

I feel like if I had never moved in to begin with, this wouldn’t be an issue. I feel like I’ve signed some agreement by moving in to begin with that I must pay in perpetuity. I feel like I’m simply moving out temporarily and this was and is her apartment first and foremost. She won’t be struggling to pay bills.

16,1grazca,AITA for not going to estranged parents 70th bday party?,"My family wants me to fly out of state to attend my mother's 70th birthday.  We have been estranged since 2022 when she called me a ""piece of shit"" for having lunch with my sisters when we were in NY celebrating my son's high school graduation with our family.    
  
Since we live 2000 miles away we rarely get home.  My mother was angry that she had to babysit my sisters kids (although she volunteered) instead of having lunch with us.  We have only spoken briefly and infrequently since then.

Last year my Dad turned 70.  I was in Canada and near home so I drove to his birthday party.  My Dad and I have had a tenuous relationship (he married my mom when I was 6 - my bio dad died when I was 2) but he has made a lot of effort to fix our relationship. I was happy to celebrate him. 

While I was there I did speak to my Mom who agreed to some of the requests I made (better communication, effort on her behalf to show interest in me and my family, etc) - this was Nov 2023 and she did not contact me again until March 2024 - she said ""it was a good day to move forward"" I agreed - said I was happy to hear it - and then she never contacted me again.

I turned 50 this summer and my sisters flew out to surprise me. My mother did not come as we were not on speaking terms AND it was at a bar with drinks, drugs and generally wild behavior.  I was not upset AT ALL that she didn't come - I didn't want her there - but she then proceeded to completely ignore my birthday.  Didn't send a card, a text, make a call or a gift - just no acknowledgment whatsoever that I even turned 50.  

Now, she is turning 70 in a few weeks.  I told my sisters early on while they were planning that I would not attend unless our Mom invited me directly and apologized for her behavior.  I never heard anything from my Mom.  Now my Dad is sending me texts offering to pay for me to fly home to celebrate her birthday.  My sisters are heavily pressuring me to ""be the bigger person"" and come or ""Mom may never forgive you""

This has been a life long pattern for us.  I am the perpetual scapegoat and black sheep of our family.  I quite honestly don't think I should have to go so she can ""save face"" because she's embarassed people will know i came for my Dad but not for her.  I told my family as much and offered to send my kids (15 and 20) in my place.  I am also already very busy the weekend they planned this - I have 3 parties of my own where I live with my friends - and I""m hosting one of them.

I've done so much therapy to move past this and don't want to set myself back.  Plus - I am ALWAYS the bigger person - time and time again - and her behavior never changes. 

Redditors - am I the asshole for not giving into my family and flying in for my Mother's bday? ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-14,"AITA for not going to estranged parents 70th bday party? My family wants me to fly out of state to attend my mother's 70th birthday.  We have been estranged since 2022 when she called me a ""piece of shit"" for having lunch with my sisters when we were in NY celebrating my son's high school graduation with our family.    
  
Since we live 2000 miles away we rarely get home.  My mother was angry that she had to babysit my sisters kids (although she volunteered) instead of having lunch with us.  We have only spoken briefly and infrequently since then.

Last year my Dad turned 70.  I was in Canada and near home so I drove to his birthday party.  My Dad and I have had a tenuous relationship (he married my mom when I was 6 - my bio dad died when I was 2) but he has made a lot of effort to fix our relationship. I was happy to celebrate him. 

While I was there I did speak to my Mom who agreed to some of the requests I made (better communication, effort on her behalf to show interest in me and my family, etc) - this was Nov 2023 and she did not contact me again until March 2024 - she said ""it was a good day to move forward"" I agreed - said I was happy to hear it - and then she never contacted me again.

I turned 50 this summer and my sisters flew out to surprise me. My mother did not come as we were not on speaking terms AND it was at a bar with drinks, drugs and generally wild behavior.  I was not upset AT ALL that she didn't come - I didn't want her there - but she then proceeded to completely ignore my birthday.  Didn't send a card, a text, make a call or a gift - just no acknowledgment whatsoever that I even turned 50.  

Now, she is turning 70 in a few weeks.  I told my sisters early on while they were planning that I would not attend unless our Mom invited me directly and apologized for her behavior.  I never heard anything from my Mom.  Now my Dad is sending me texts offering to pay for me to fly home to celebrate her birthday.  My sisters are heavily pressuring me to ""be the bigger person"" and come or ""Mom may never forgive you""

This has been a life long pattern for us.  I am the perpetual scapegoat and black sheep of our family.  I quite honestly don't think I should have to go so she can ""save face"" because she's embarassed people will know i came for my Dad but not for her.  I told my family as much and offered to send my kids (15 and 20) in my place.  I am also already very busy the weekend they planned this - I have 3 parties of my own where I live with my friends - and I""m hosting one of them.  I honestly feel like they are asking me to once again ""forgive"" her for terrible behavior and i feel like if I do show I'm destroying hte boundaries I've set and opening myself up again for her to treat me terribly.

17,1grakfh,AITA for having a security camera in the living room?,"Several months ago I installed several security cameras around the house. In addition to outside cameras, I added one inside overlooking the living room and kitchen. This camera is plainly visible on the ceiling, and it keeps audio and video for several weeks before overwriting. This is the only inside camera, and it only “sees"" the living room and kitchen — no bedrooms or bathrooms are visible.

If someone is visiting for more than just a few minutes or will be alone in the house, then I make sure they know about the camera. I acknowledge I should also hang a cute sign in the living room alerting everyone there is a camera, and I plan to do this.

Several times my partner was over and the camera recorded us having a disagreement. As is typical, there was conflict over what exactly each person said. Afterward I found it very useful to review the recording and get a non-biased perspective of what happened. I even offered to share the recording with my partner and review it together.

When I was a kid, my parents argued constantly about who said what, and I find it comforting to have a recording to reference if there’s any doubt. I think this eliminates gas-lighting, intentional or otherwise.

Here’s the problem. My partner has grown to distrust the recordings and how I might use them. They said they do not give consent and could never live in the house if the camera is allowed to record audio while they are there. I offered to give them the same access to recordings that I have, but that was not acceptable to them.

I know my partner and I need to resolve any issues regarding consent, but am I the asshole for wanting to keep the camera?

19,1gra64h,AITA For Scolding My Sister For Not Doing Things Herself?,"My little sister (17F) has been living like a 'princess' in the house since she was born. She never helped doing any house chores such as sweeping, mopping, dusting, etc. She doesn't even clean up her own room. All my life, my elder sister and I have been doing all of these, including cleaning up her room. Yes, we could've asked her to help with the chores, sure. Here's the thing, she would get mad and start arguing just because we ask her to help out or be responsible since she's also living under the same roof as us. That's why we just kept quiet, did the chores ourselves, and never asked her for help because we're just too exhausted of these constant unnecessary arguments, and we also don't want to stress out our parents who are already in their 50s. Besides doing chores, she would always come to me to help her with the most basic things that even a 10 year old could do, such as fixing her chair, opening a jar or a bottle with a tight lid, fixing her loose water bottle, and other things that anyone can do themselves.

So here's why I'm writing this. Yesterday, she came into my room for help as usual. She wanted me to fix her correction tape because the tape came off. It is fixable, but I realised, the reason why she's always asking for help is because she never solved problems by herself. That's probably why she never learnt these basic life skills because she always depends on us and expects others to help her out. So, I said ""no"" and lied by saying ""it's not fixable"". But that's not it. I also said ""no"" because I was busy and not in the mood.

Last night, I was busy with my final year thesis, so I was already stressed out. And when she asks for help, she's always demanding and forceful, even after you've said 'no' for the hundredth time. Add that situation with my already bad mood, yeah that's a recipe for disaster. I got mad at her, yelled at her, and just told her the truth. I don't remember the exact words, but it's something like ""You should start doing things yourself and solving your own problems. Stop being selfish by always expecting others to help you out, and stop being narcissistic by being mad at others and blaming others when you're the one who's being selfish for not using your own brain to fix or solve something. You're 17 years old, not 7 years old. You need to grow up and be independent."" and then I also reminded her about all the things her elder sister and I had done for her since she was born to further prove my point that she is selfish and never done anything at home to help the family out. Well, she got mad and we argued for like a good 30 minutes. Thank god, my parents weren't home, otherwise they would get stressed out, which is the last thing I want.

I've kept it in my chest for so long, and I'm tired of playing this 'good' brother who's actually being taken advantage of by his little sister.

20,1gr9vi8,WIBTA if I don’t go to my friend’s event just because I don’t want to make an effort to attend?,"I (F32) have a friend (F30-ish) from work who is very nice and welcoming. She really tries to make nice things for others (for example, she is organizing my baby shower at the office). She is hosting a dinner at her place next month. She invited a few people from our office along with their partners. She sent an invitation for me and my husband about a month ago (so 2 months in advance of the event) and asked us to rsvp last week.

My husband has a night shift scheduled that day, so he won’t be able to come. I would be going by myself, except that there are some important complications:
1. I will be 7 months pregnant at that point, and driving long distances is complicated for me because my legs get tired.
2. The dinner is on the outskirts of the city in one direction, and I live in the outskirts to the other direction. The drive there is at least 1.5 hours and it could be more if there is traffic.
3. I have a medical appointment scheduled for earlier that day for an immunoglobuline vaccine (I didn’t pick the date for the appointment) and I’m not sure what side effects I’ll have right after the vaccine.

I told my friend that we won’t be able to make it to her dinner, thank her very much for the invitation, and told her that I wanted to take her out for lunch one day when we are both working in person to catch up.

She said she would love it if I could come and asked if there was any way I could make it. She even offered to have her sibling pick me up and take me to the dinner and back. And this is why I think I might be the AH

There are technically many ways that I could accommodate this dinner and actually attend, but I honestly don’t want to make an effort. My husband already has to ask for a lot of changes in his shifts to come with me to medical appointments so he doesn’t want to ask for more changes for a non-medical event, taking extra time to make a stop on my way back is not that appealing since it would be dark already, and to be honest, making small talk with her sibling on my way to dinner and back in addition to having to socialize during dinner is just not something that I want to do at this point. 

I’ve had a healthy pregnancy so far, but in terms of symptoms and emotionally, I’m a mess. I get tired very easily, I cry all day, and I am uncomfortable 24/7. I’m just not in a good place to make a big effort to go to a social event, but I feel bad because she has been planning this dinner for a long time and the fact that her sibling is willing to drive 4+ hours to take me to dinner makes me feel like I should put more of an effort to be there.

23,1gr7ysp,"AITA for leaving the room after my bf ""surprised"" me?","My(23f) bf(26M) had been away for almost a month and was supposed to return this morning from his trip, but told me that in the last minute he decided that he wanted to stay one more day at his sister's (who he hadn't seen in a while) place. I had been waiting excitedly for an entire month just to see him, made some decorations and wore his favourite clothes, ordered his favourite snacks etc., and was very disappointed and upset when he changed his plan last minute. He had no particular reason to want to stay one extra day, so that made me even more upset. The thing is, he has surprised me in the past by showing up earlier than he was supposed to, so i asked him at least 5 times whether he's lying to me because he wants to surprise me, because if he is, I would be really upset to be disappointed only to realise that it is not real and do not want to go through a set of negative emotions for no reason. He said he is being genuine and even sent me screenshot of the ""cancelled"" ticket. So, i let it go and took down the decor, changed, ate some of the snacks and cried myself to sleep. 

But guess what happens? He shows up on the day (today morning) he was supposed to. I was obviously happy to see him but not as enthusiastic as I should have been. He asked me why I was being somewhat dry and distant, so I explained that I had told him very clearly that I did not want to feel disappointed for no reason and him telling me intricate lies that made me feel really sad, only to show up anyways made me feel like he did not value my feelings. He got mad and said I was being unreasonable because ""everyone likes surprises"". I told him that while usually I do too, this absolutely did not feel like a surprise, and left the room and went to my friend's room. I got a bunch of text messages from him saying I am being unreasonable and that I am overreacting. My friend also thinks that maybe I am being a bit unreasonable to leave him alone when I haven't seen him in so long, so now I feel a little guilty for walking out; AITA? 

Edit: HOLY MOLY I did NOT expect this to blow up this much… 
I read through almost all your comments and if I’m being honest, I felt a little defensive of him. But your comments overwhelmingly convinced me that I should value my feelings more than I have so far. I also realised this is not the first time he hasn’t valued my feelings.
I appreciate all of your comments and I had a long talk with him about this, and other times as well where my boundaries were not respected at all. 
And he absolutely did not get it. He half-heartedly apologised but took almost no accountability and I think this is the last straw honestly. I’m done putting in all the effort, and I will break up with him soon. It’ll be hard because I really thought this one actually cared lol, but yeah. Think I need to be single for a while now.

24,1gr7w9k,WIBTA for telling my MIL she has to change? ,". For context, we live in the UK, I’m f19, my bf is m20, his mom is 50. 

Me and my bf have been together for 2 years, I first met his mom when we started officially dating. She seemed so nice at first, and really made an effort to get to know me.

My first real red flags came up pretty early on but I brushed it off as she had seemed too nice.

He seems to do an unreasonable amount of chores, on top of working really late nights. Once she waited for him to get home at 12pm to ask him to feed the dogs, and had a go at him for the dogs not being fed. 

She works an office job from home 5 days a week and has no health issues. There was no reason she couldn’t have just walked to the kitchen and fed the dogs herself IMO.

He hoovers,loads&unloads the dishwasher,deep cleans the bathroom once or twice a month,makes his moms bed and cleans her room,carries and unpacks his and his moms food shopping,feeds and walks the dogs (she never does) cooks dinner for them if she wants something, goes to the shop if she wants milk/bread/wine, and those are just a handful off the top of my head.

I’m not saying that he shouldn’t be doing any chores. But please keep in mind that she doesn’t do any of the above, ever. Even though she’s at home, has no health issues, and has no real reason why she couldn’t IMO. I think it should be balanced.

She also has a weird, almost freudian relationship with him, that makes us both uncomfortable. She calls him hot, tries to make him cuddle her at night if I’m not staying over, ENJOYS trying to walk in on us if she thinks we’re having sex
My bf & I also buy own food when we stay over at his mom’s, & I always ask if it’s OK for me to use the shower/electricals/water. I try to be polite and not be any sort of burden.

She recently had a word with me because I ‘left his room a mess’ when I left one evening. She said I let him do everything for me & it s not fair as he works alot. Weird, seeing as she makes him do so much around the house, and I don’t live here it’s not my job to make sure his room is clean. Ofc I’m respectful to his things and space, try to be as clean as possible when I am there, but his own mess is his. I’m not his house maid, and I wouldn’t expect him to be mine.

So, forward to about a month ago, me and my bf mentioned wanting to move out together. She suggested we just move in to his house. We spoke about it, I agreed, going against my better judgement.
She asked for £700 rent from us which I think is reasonable as a base. People will have very mixed opinions on that. However, we also would have to contribute to other bills and pay our own food. That on top of bus money, my savings, and my take home, I’m not too open to paying that much right now, which I think is reasonable if I have the option to stay at home and only pay £100 rent to my mom.
I’ve been thinking more and more, and experiencing more and more of her hostility & passive aggression.  I know I don’t want to move in,  but it feels like a lose lose.

One of my group members (John) had a family member who worked in computer science so we decided that we'll work with them. 

So during the time to work on the project one of the teachers, Ms Kate came up to us and asked us what we were doing for our project (this happened around the beginning of november, 3 months after we began the projects) and we talked about it and then she went to another group and asked what they were doing and they also said compsci (they apparently chose this months in advance) and then she told them that we were also doing a project on that subject. 

So the other group started coming up to us and saying that they planned to do compsci and that we were encroaching on their thing but then their group leader (Sara) said it's fine and whatever. So we called our contact for the project (John's uncle) and we got confirmation to work with them.

The other group also went to call their contacts and by some twist of fate their contact was our contact (the school had given a list of contacts but we had no idea that John's uncle was there because it was under a different name). So they started saying that we are copying them and stealing their ideas and Sara says that I'm only doing this because she was talking about her project in class that day ( this was our backup plan for more than a month).

And she and her group started saying that we had no right to do that. I got angry and told my group that we should just change but most of them disagreed saying that we worked too hard to just throw it away. 

So the other group brought their project advisor (Mr. Thomas) into this and the project manager — Ms Johnson (oversees all the projects). Mr. Thomas and Ms Johnson agreed with them saying that we couldn't  just steal other people's ideas.

So I explained to them that every project that we proposed was rejected and that we had no idea about the contacts (they didn't even know what they planned to do they just knew that it would have something to do with computer science). Then Ms Johnson asks me who rejected our ideas and I say that it was her then she goes:oh yeah. I remember rejecting that. 

By then tears were already streaming down my face because I was so frustrated. Then our advisor Ms. Renee stepped in and said that we were not changing our project because we had been working hard on various things because we kept getting rejected (without real reason) and that it is frustrating 

Ms Johnson just says that we didn't need to change our project and that I didn't need to cry for this (this project counted towards my GPA) and then she spoke with my advisor and left.  Ms Renee said that we should continue our work and that if they try to cause trouble that she'll deal with it

He had worked for a 1 1/2 months in total. Closer to the beginning of us being together he moved in with me and my roommate and he got a job and we were able to save up for our own apartment in under a month which cost 1400+. We were also able to get some furniture at low prices and luckily family and friends also gave us some furniture. Before we even move in he had quit that job and I told him that he needed to find one asap. Days went by and I questioned him to see if he had applied anywhere and he hadn’t and he used the excuse of “no Wi-Fi at the new place” to apply for jobs in which I understood. He then asked me one day if his friends girlfriend and friend could move in and they would help pay bills and I agreed because I was afraid I would have to do it on my own. I eventually found out his friends girlfriend use to date my now fiancé a couple months before we got together but it didn’t last long, maybe a week or two. That bothered me for awhile but I just chose to ignore it. Long story short they were the absolute worst roommates, I did get pretty close to the female but the partying, drugs , etc was bothering me immensely. I kicked them out a couple months into them living with us and it was a small legal issue that was solved within 2 weeks time. My fiancé still at this point did not have a job. Around the same time my mom got ahold of me and my sister ended up in the hospital for medical reasons, luckily she survived but it hurt me inside knowing my baby sister felt that way and I didn’t know about it. After talking over with my fiancé we both decided to offer to let my mom and two siblings move in. My mom agreed to help with household chores, as well as provide household groceries and other necessities when needed.

I keep pushing him to get a job because I can’t keep paying bills on my own, I’m several months behind on electric and gas. My rent is close to 700, I no longer have a working vehicle and it’s too difficult to save up for one on my own. After working 2+ jobs for almost a year my body has shut down and it’s hard to even work one job now where I’m so burnt out. He gets upset because I don’t want intimacy and I can go weeks without it. He constantly plays video games and says he’s trying his hardest but I don’t see how. Our recent issue is his dog whose about 4 years old. I have paid for the dogs food, treats, and toys since we’ve been together. When we first got together someone stole his dog so I tracked down who it was and got his dog back. He cried because he was so happy to see his lost friend but now he wants to get rid of him. I don’t see why because I pay for everything the dog needs.

28,1gr6nzh,AITA for telling my dad he chose between me and his fiancée when he prioritized her surgery over mine?,"I(17f) have had a rocky relationship with my dad. My parents married after I was born, hoping to provide a stable family for me, but they divorced when I was 11 after my dad went to rehab, & things only worsened from there. During rehab, he met his current fiancée, and they later had a kid(6F). Since then, my dad has been mostly absent from my life—whenever I have important events, he either has an excuse or doesn’t show. I’d estimate he’s been present for less than half of my events since their divorce.

A few years ago, I was diagnosed with scoliosis, & initially, surgery wasn’t needed. However, my condition got worse, & I was finally scheduled for surgery on 11/20 of this year. I told my dad about it months ago, expressing how much I needed his support this time, & he promised he’d be there. But later, he texted to say he’d planned a vacation that would keep him away until mid-December, just as my recovery period would be ending. It broke my heart, but I accepted it.

Then, 2 hurricanes hit his vacation spot, & he told me he’d make my surgery. I felt a glimmer of hope. But then, just a week before my surgery, he texted again saying his fiancée’s lung cancer surgery had been scheduled for the same day, a few hours before mine, at a hospital 30 minutes away. He said he “might not” make it to my surgery, but with him, “might not” usually means “won’t.” He added that this wasn’t about who he loved more. That message shattered me. I realized that no matter how much I hoped, he might never give me the attention & support I needed. I broke down on my kitchen floor that day.

After sitting with my feelings, I texted him to tell him how deeply his actions hurt me. I said it wasn’t only about love but about showing care, & that he’d given me hope only to let me down again. I questioned if his fiancée’s surgery had really been scheduled last minute, or if he had known earlier but hadn’t told me. I asked him to show he was my dad through his actions, not just his words. He responded, insisting the surgery was only scheduled the day he’d told me. But because he’s lied in the past to save face, I reached out to someone who might know the truth.

I then sent a follow-up message, clarifying that my frustration wasn’t with his fiancée; it was with his ongoing absence & lack of support. I said that even if his reasons were genuine, he could have at least shown some empathy. I told him I hoped he’d be a better father for my half-sister than he has been for me. In a final message, I made it clear that I was done putting in all the effort to maintain our relationship on my own. I told him that if he wanted to be my dad, I would gladly be his daughter, but if he chose not to, I would be fine with that too.

He hasn’t responded, & honestly, I’d prefer he sit with what I’ve said. For once, I hope he really thinks about his actions & the impact they’ve had on me.

During rehab, he met his current fiancée, and they later had a kid(6F). Since then, my dad has been mostly absent from my life—whenever I have important events, he either has an excuse or doesn’t show. I’d estimate he’s been present for less than half of my events since their divorce.

A few years ago, I was diagnosed with scoliosis, & initially, surgery wasn’t needed. However, my condition got worse, & I was finally scheduled for surgery on 11/20 of this year. I told my dad about it months ago, expressing how much I needed his support this time, & he promised he’d be there. But later, he texted to say he’d planned a vacation that would keep him away until mid-December, just as my recovery period would be ending. It broke my heart, but I accepted it.

Then, 2 hurricanes hit his vacation spot, & he told me he’d make my surgery. I felt a glimmer of hope. But then, just a week before my surgery, he texted again saying his fiancée’s lung cancer surgery had been scheduled for the same day, a few hours before mine, at a hospital 30 minutes away. He said he “might not” make it to my surgery, but with him, “might not” usually means “won’t.” He added that this wasn’t about who he loved more. That message shattered me. I realized that no matter how much I hoped, he might never give me the attention & support I needed. I broke down on my kitchen floor that day.

After sitting with my feelings, I texted him to tell him how deeply his actions hurt me. I said it wasn’t only about love but about showing care, & that he’d given me hope only to let me down again. I questioned if his fiancée’s surgery had really been scheduled last minute, or if he had known earlier but hadn’t told me. I asked him to show he was my dad through his actions, not just his words. He responded, insisting the surgery was only scheduled the day he’d told me. But because he’s lied in the past to save face, I reached out to someone who might know the truth.

I then sent a follow-up message, clarifying that my frustration wasn’t with his fiancée; it was with his ongoing absence & lack of support. I said that even if his reasons were genuine, he could have at least shown some empathy. I told him I hoped he’d be a better father for my half-sister than he has been for me. In a final message, I made it clear that I was done putting in all the effort to maintain our relationship on my own. I told him that if he wanted to be my dad, I would gladly be his daughter, but if he chose not to, I would be fine with that too.

He hasn’t responded, & honestly, I’d prefer he sit with what I’ve said. For once, I hope he really thinks about his actions & the impact they’ve had on me.

32,1gr5odq,AITA for expecting my boyfriend to do all the chores while I work 2 jobs and go to school full-time?,"My boyfriend and I are in our 20s and we’ve been living together for a couple years now, we have a really good relationship and communicate well, I think this is just a matter of we both have a lot on our plates but any input is welcome.

I’m currently working 2 jobs, 5 days a week. I’m also a full-time student, so my other 2 days are taken up with being at school for 10-12 hours. I’m in my senior year of my degree as well so it’s a heavy course load and I’m also applying to grad school and internships at the moment. All 7 days of my week are occupied with either work or school, and I have to wake up between 5-7 am everyday. I’m barely home, but when I am home it’s spent doing homework, eating, and sleeping.

My boyfriend finished his degree a couple years ago and he is working full time, 4 days a week. Outside of that, he goes to the gym about 5 days a week, every Friday night he goes bowling with his friends, and a couple days a week he plays a card game with his friends.

At the start of the semester, we agreed that he would take on most of the chores, but I would help when I can and I’d still help with dinner because I enjoy cooking. He sometimes complains about having to do the chores and will ask me to help out with things here and there such as cleaning the cat’s litter, and I’ll do it. We both hate cleaning honestly so I get it’s annoying, but I’m starting to feel frustrated when he expects me to help with more chores.

In my eyes, we agreed on this beforehand and he was completely okay with supporting me. He also has 3 days a week that he gets to sleep in and he’s able to go the gym and have hobbies. I’ve been stressed because I don’t even have the time or mental capacity to make doctors appts that I need, and I had to stop going to the gym a couple months back. I don’t have the luxury of having time for myself, not to mention my body is physically sore as both my jobs also require me being on my feet all day.

AITA for getting frustrated that he expects me to help with housework too or am I putting too much on his plate? Does this sound balanced/fair? 


Update: Thank you for both perspectives I needed it!
To answer some questions:

-We split the bills evenly, I also have car payments hence why I needed a second job to help cover it. One of my jobs is also relevant to my field and I need it for my resume.

-My schedule is my choice to an extent, I’m going into a career in healthcare and the current school load is required, I don’t have any flexibility there.

-I work 40-45 hrs a week, he works 40.

-As someone said, we both see it as him supporting me towards my goals, and ultimately we want a life together, it was an agreement for our future.

-We do errands together, I still help with dishes and laundry regularly. I’m cleaning the floors this weekend and he asked for help cleaning the bathrooms as well.

33,1gr5h2o,AITA for stealing my neighbor's cat?,"This past weekend, a very sweet cat started showing up on my doorstep and since I had never seen her around before, I assumed she was someone's lost cat. I took some pictures of her and made a Facebook post to see if anyone knew whose cat she was. I then left a bowl of water and some cat food on the porch for her and a little box with a blanket in it for her to sleep in if she wanted. And I went inside. 

Later that night, I saw the same cat nearly get hit by a car, so I decided to call my landlady and see if she knew of the people next door having a cat that may have gotten out. There are several people that live in the house next to me but only one of them speaks English so I  could have gone over there myself, but usually when I try to communicate with them it does not get me very far. My landlady said she did not know of them having a cat but she would ask. 

The next day, I was about to take this cat to a vet clinic to have her checked for a microchip and I get a text from the landlady saying that it is in fact the neighbor's cat. Apparently, they had visitors who had a dog with them and because the cat and the dog didn't get along, their solution to that was to put their previously indoor-only cat outside. Supposedly the visitors were leaving that night and she would be back inside.

Around 8:30pm that night, the cat was still on my doorstep, crying to be let in. It was also like 35 degrees outside. With my neighbors nowhere in sight, I scooped her up and brought her inside. I informed my landlady that I had done this and that they can come knock on my door if they want me to give her back. That was 3 days ago and the cat is still with me.

Since she's been in my care I have discovered that she has fleas, is sneezing and congested, and has a significantly fractured Canine tooth. I gave her one of my cat's Nexgards for the fleas for now, but she needs more extensive care than that. I also have no idea if she is spayed, vaccinated, etc. If she is still with me by the weekend I am going to make her a vet appointment because she needs one.

When we met up in our old favourite bar it turned out their dad was terminally ill, and they'd been at home for a week already. So of course, I tried to offer a shoulder to cry on, but it seems they mostly wanted a distraction, so we just talked about whatever all evening.
This monday I got a text that sadly the father passed away, and if I maybe wanted to go to the funeral or wake?

I couldn't get a day of, but I'd of course make time for the wake the evening before to offer any sort support I could.
I got a text back asking if maybe I could get half a day off, so I could still meet their current *my name* they told me about last Friday?
I said I couldn't, but again stated I'd like to be at the wake.
Yesterday I texted them again asking how everything was going and when/where everything was. I got a semi-joke answer and nothing actually useable.

38,1gr4iqj,AITA for avoiding a girl from school who I thought was avoiding me? (M17) ,"So this all started mid last month when I met this girl who I’ll be calling Sally. Me and Sally’s interactions were a little short and shallow at first, but one thing that’s important to note that SHE was the one who initiated like 2 of 3 times. Eventually, we started having longer, more productive conversations, most notable of which was when we got on the same bus and I sat with her and talked to her about life, our interests etc. I was really trying to get to know her and she seemed engaged and not uncomfortable at all. But soon after, I noticed that she started acting avoidant. One time, after class I happened to be walking behind her and her friend on the way to the stairs. She noticed me, and instead of going down the stairs, she went UP which makes NO SENSE because the floor right above us was and still is undergoing maintenance, so she really had no reason to go up those stairs unless she had an objective which was to avoid me, plain and simple. Another time I was trying to say hi to her but she just straight up ignored me like I wasn’t there.. my voice was loud enough, I was in her peripheral, but she still didn’t acknowledge me (well to be fair, she did have headphones in but I think I was loud enough). Anyway, ever since then, I have started to avoid her as she ignored me, quite overtly actually, and she seems to have been doing the same. This has been going on for the latter half of last month and the beginning of this one (just saying this so we have a timeline). So, last week, something happened that POSSIBLY, MIGHT HAVE, REMOTELY disproven all the assumptions that I had up to that point. I was hanging out with her friends (who I’m acquainted with and have been acquainted with before I even met her ), and when she had to leave she said goodbye to ME, directly. So, I might be crazy, but doesn’t that mean she acknowledged my existence even though I thought she was avoiding me?? Was it all a big misunderstanding?? Is she bipolar???? Am I bipolar????? I honestly don’t know, and this whole thing has had me in a stupidly strong death grip for some reason (probably because I kind of like her, which is a fact I probably should have mentioned previously).

Anyway, Reddit do your thing.

40,1gr3pyz,AITA for confronting my bridesmaid about her behavior during my wedding? ,"I (33F) got married last year. One of my bridesmaids was “Rebecca” (30F), who came with her longterm boyfriend, “Alex”. At one point during the reception Rebecca disappeared, having gone off into the woods with one of my husband’s friends, “Brad”. She was gone for a while - I think about an hourish. Alex, who knew no one, was looking around for her at one point, shortly after which she came running up to me crying, because Alex had come upon her and Brad in a compromising position. She told me that nothing had happened (seemingly a highly literal description of events from what I have since heard) but that Alex, upset, had smashed a beer bottle and left the wedding. Over the course of the night, she kept pulling me aside to talk about it. I tried to console and support her, despite not wanting to be occupied by this on my wedding night. She also got drunker and drunker and continued to flirt with Brad: dancing together, holding hands…everyone could see what was happening and kept trying to keep them apart. It was a whole thing. The next morning, she came to the post-wedding brunch - with Alex - where she again pulled me aside to speak to me about it. Apparently after Alex left the wedding, he drunk drove their car somewhere and slept in it - really scary stuff. I was totally supportive of her, however, while also being in the middle of my own wedding weekend with 100 other people.

Because I was so consumed with my wedding, I didn’t really contemplate her behavior at the time and it wasn’t until we returned from our honeymoon that it sort of clicked for me that I was upset with her. I sent her a message letting her know that I was ‘bummed out’ (the literal words I used) that she had behaved so carelessly at our wedding and hadn’t been more mindful of her impact. I crafted my message to her for a long time so that the tone was direct, but not overly accusatory - I was conscious of not wanting to embarrass her. We then had a couple of exchanges that continue to bewilder me: she said she was really hurt because she felt like I was judging her relationship with Alex; I shouldn’t be upset because she felt like she tried to protect me from it and hadn’t allowed it to ruin my day; she was mad at me because she thought my communication was tantamount to kicking her while she was down during a difficult time; she hadn’t said anything to me since because she was prioritizing her relationship with Alex, which she wouldn’t apologize for; and, eventually, she said she didn’t want to speak to me because she no longer trusts me and doesn’t feel safe. I called BS and said that friends are allowed to call each other out when they behave poorly, and that all I wanted was for her to acknowledge it, apologize, move on. But I have now not heard from her in over a year.

41,1gr3bva,AITA for expecting my friends to notice I was struggling with our project after surgery?,"Me (28F) and my friends Amanda (33F) and Isaac (36M) were in a group for a final project with two other girls who are not involved. We split the project’s topics and would send the Power Point topics to me when we were done. On the week of the presentation, it happened that I had previously scheduled eye surgery. When everyone sent me their parts I saw they sent me their research instead of topics so I would have to read it and determine what to put in.

I did half of the PP but after my surgery, my vision was blurry, it was almost impossible to read. I tried my best to keep working but because of the double vision I was very nauseous, throwing up and had a headache for days. I ended up asking a cousin for help and we managed a bit more but couldn’t finish.

From the start, I was texting the project group chat about my condition and troubled vision. I should have asked for help from the group, I know that, but I felt I was responsible for what was assigned to me so I didn’t, that was a mistake. On the day of the presentation my friend asked me where the PP was and I told him I hadn’t finished. My two friends were rude to me and I understood their annoyance but felt like they could have been at least a little understanding since I told them about my symptoms and ended up being rude to them too.

When we met next I was angry and acted rude and arrogant and really shouldn’t have. Isaac was very kind and pulled me aside so we could talk. He said he couldn’t understand why I hadn’t turned in the PP. I was confused because I told them multiple times how sick I was. And if they didn’t understand it, they could have asked me why, I’m their friend, right? He told me I could have asked for help, that communication was a two way street, I agreed and told him they could have offered help too. Amanda ignored me for a week after that, she was not part of the conversation.

In the meantime, I apologized to Isaac and the two girls about not turning in the PP, that that was on me and I didn’t want them to think badly of me because I always put a lot of effort in projects and this was not typical. When I finally talked to Amanda, I found out that neither she nor Isaac had read my messages in the group chat. So, to them, I let them down for no reason. I might have felt the same way if I was in their place.

I know they both have very demanding jobs. It’s just, they could have sent me a text afterwards, asking “Why didn’t you turn in the PP?” but they didn’t. Amanda said I should have asked her for help directly and that I should know that she doesn’t read group chats and I kind of agree, I’ve known her for 2 years. I could have asked for help, I know they wouldn’t have denied it to me, I guess I was being proud and stubborn.

I know this might sound stupid and childish, but AITA for feeling abandoned by my friends during what happened?

42,1gr388x,WIBTA if I don't let FIL see his only grandchild until he apologized to his son (my husband),"My (30f) husband (30m) is the only child of his father (82m). His parents have been divorced since he was 4 years old but still have a friendship relationship. My FIL is old as I already mentioned and has the mindset of a typical retired man. Over the last couple of years his health has started to slowly decline. He has prostate cancer which is luckily an easy battle, he's getting more forgetful as you do with age and obviously can't do the things a young person can. He's gotten slow and all that. He is still able to live alone and my husband regularly does the shopping for him and helps him out with odd jobs he can't do on his own or are too dangerous for him. As of now he always comes by every week to hang out with us and our toddler who he loves very much obviously.

The thing is, my FIL can be very petty. He has lost many friends and his wife over the years because of his behaviour. He has such strange expectations of people and if they don't meet his expectations he doesn't talk to them. My father has known him for over 30 years and apparently he's always been like that. So he the only thing he does all day is visit the doctor and stay at home all day since he has nobody to talk to. It's a different generation, I get it but still, it is mainly his own fault for being alone.

Yesterday my husband had gone to his dads home to bring his shopping and he was immediately berated for not taking him to one of his gardens. Basically last Saturday my MIL came to babysit and we took our big lawnmower and other tools to a garden in another village that belongs to my FIL and we cut the grass, bushes and trees. That garden was my FIL passion over most of his adult life but can't take care of it anymore for obvious reasons. My husband and I did all the work and sadly didn't get everything done cause it was getting late.

When my husband told him about that yesterday he exploded, saying we should have taken him along with us. Mind you, it was a very spontaneous decision cause the weather was good for that sort of work on Saturday and we had taken him along before but he had always been in the way. And we would have to drive him home and such since he doesn't have a car.

My husband was obviously very upset about that argument. He works full time and taking care of that garden is an extra thing that he doesn't really like to do since it's extra work. We already have our own house and garden AND the one where his dad lives so that's three gardens in total. Also, we don't pick any of the fruit from that garden or use it in general since we have our own. We literally only go to that garden to keep everything trimmed and healthy.

FIL hasn't apologized after that argument and he's supposed to come to visit today. I'm really thinking about only letting him inside the house and letting him see his only grandchild if he apologizes to my husband.

I went on holiday to Prague with an old uni friend (I’m 34, he’s 31). We’ve kept in touch but hadn’t traveled together before. I usually travel with close friends, but they couldn’t make it, so I suggested we go.

From the first night, he wanted to stay out drinking until early morning. I was up for it the first night but wanted to mix it up with some sightseeing during the day. Every night, he kept pushing to stay out later than I was comfortable with (we’re talking 2 a.m. or later). When I’d call it a night, he’d complain and guilt-trip me, saying holidays are for staying out late.

Despite all this, he still wanted to keep going out and even started calling me “Sleepy Joe” because I didn’t want to be out until dawn every night.

44,1gr2pn2,AITA in this argument with my roommate? ,"So basically, I have a roommate who do some of the chores around the house everyday, and one of his chore was mopping the floor. When he mops the floor, he would have a bucket to fill it up with water and cleaning solution and once he's done, he will rinse out the water and reuse the bucket the next day. 

But the issue is that he has been using the same bucket for 5+ years and occasionally, he would just clean the bucket and continue to use it. I have asked him many many times to change the bucket for once cuz it's been used for that long and he would insist that since it's not broken, it can still be used.
But this time I had enough and I got in a stupid and a heated argument asking him to change the bucket since it would have so much disgusting dirty stains, soapy, sticky and grout?? (Idk the word) and I told him that there is no point in cleaning and reusing so many times and it's easier and more hygienic to replace a $5 bucket. He would counter and compare to things like ""why don't you throw away your clothes, your furniture, since you have been using it for many years too""

He said I should stop insisting on changing the bucket but the thing is It's actually disgusting since it's used to mop the floors and although the bucket isn't broken, it's so used that it's better to replace a 5+ year bucket for once😭.

45,1gr2lfe,AITA for making my cousin who ive been having a cold war with for like 5 months pay me for accidentally breaking my phone screen? ,"so the cold war started last class vacation when i fell sick and my grandma asked her to do a favor to get my hanging clothes for drying outside and instead of just refusing outright she decided to say why her when im there lying in bed and how lazy i am. she has done this a lot of times even to this day; talking behind my back, adding fuel to the fire when im in a tight position and js straight up invalidating (snickering, telling me it's no big deal) my feelings when im having a breakdown but i let all that pass 'coz im a people pleaser and i js can't stay mad for long not until that time when i was sick 'coz no way im gonna let her continue to disrespect me like that when not once did i do any of that to her. i burst out for the first time, and since then, i have never talked to her which was actually a good decision since she can't ask me for favors anymore (the audacity of her to refuse my grandma as if she has forgotten that ive helped her do a majority of her assignments and projects so she could pass her grade, let's js see if she can pass her current grade without taking a summer class lol)

now, earlier, she bumped into the table where i left my phone to charge and its screen protector, and the phone's screen itself got broken, and i told her to pay for its fixing. either, she takes it to the repair shop herself or she gives me the money. maybe, if she was not so mean to me and chose to simply erase my existence out of her mind like what im doing these past few months i would have chosen to close my mouth and js let her out of the bat (just like what ive always been doing!) but she deserves it. for once, im not gonna say it's okay and sulk afterwards when, in fact, it was not okay.

i can't even imagine how ive managed to remain 'friends' with her. im js glad im not anymore and that our 'bond' wouldn't be able to sway anymore.

(edit: i became too defensive ig and the bot told me to define my actions to be more asshole like so despite knowing so d*mn well that they're financially unstable, i insisted her to pay me. and im actually quite happy of the situation 'coz  ngl ive been wishing for the worst for her and if this js ain't perfect?)",Not the A-hole,2024-11-14,"AITA for making my cousin who ive been having a cold war with for like 5 months pay me for accidentally breaking my phone screen?  so the cold war started last class vacation when i fell sick and my grandma asked her to do a favor to get my hanging clothes for drying outside and instead of just refusing outright she decided to say why her when im there lying in bed and how lazy i am. she has done this a lot of times even to this day; talking behind my back, adding fuel to the fire when im in a tight position and js straight up invalidating (snickering, telling me it's no big deal) my feelings when im having a breakdown but i let all that pass 'coz im a people pleaser and i js can't stay mad for long not until that time when i was sick 'coz no way im gonna let her continue to disrespect me like that when not once did i do any of that to her. i burst out for the first time, and since then, i have never talked to her which was actually a good decision since she can't ask me for favors anymore (the audacity of her to refuse my grandma as if she has forgotten that ive helped her do a majority of her assignments and projects so she could pass her grade, let's js see if she can pass her current grade without taking a summer class lol)

46,1gr2kha,WIBTA If I Ask My Friend About My Role In Our Group?,"Hi, there. I (22F) is now in her final year of uni and is just doing her thesis. However, lately, I've been questioning my old friend group back in highschool. You see, I was in a group with 6 people, 3 girls and 3 boys (all same age). And, here's the thing, my former closest friend, lets call her NA (22F), was in a relationship with someone in the group, AJ (22M). I, too, was in a relation (well, it wasn't like dating but romantically linked) with AR (22M). However, AR and I broke up 3 months later and because of a mistake I made (yes, I took it emotionally and wasn't thinking right) and I throw water at him. Not long after that, I was kicked out of the group. All this happened in 10th grade.

However, in 11th grade, most of them befriended me again and I was like ""Okay, cool"" as in, I have my friends. And, then....it gets worse. However, the worst part really isn't the main topic (maybe for another time because it isn't relevant imo) but one of them, I think it was NA who told me that the group felt kinda empty without me because I was like the glue who can stick everyone together.

These past few nights, I kept questioning myself if I was ever a member of the group or if I was just a sidelined member/outsider of the group as there are many instances I recall back where I felt like that and felt lonely. Second, I keep second guessing myself If I was a member or was just a glue because of that confession alone. Third, I started to wonder if the group was ever a family since the word family was used in our group name. Why I've been wondering about this is due to my current group (yes, we're kinda doing our own thing rn because most of us are in our final year) relationship, where I don't feel like just the glue and I do feel like I am a part of the group. And the term family was used after our internship ended (yes, we met and work together in our internship. sorry forgot to add that).

Since then, I've tried reaching out to 2 people from that group, AR and NZ. As for now, only AR had given me the answer and NZ hasn't. Another person I tried to reached out is RT (22F) and I feel like since we used to go to the same uni and live kinda close, I choose to talk it out with her. But something in me tells me not to do it. Heck, I don't even know now If I should ask her. What do you think, Reddit? WIBTA if I ask my friend about my role in the group? If you guys wants to call me the AH/NTA, It's okay and I can understand the criticism. I'm looking for the right direction for this one. Sorry if this is too long or too hard to understand because it really is kinda complicated. If there's any questions, please do comment down here

EDIT: Hey, all. I don't know if everyone have read the recent comment, so I'm just gonna add in here. I have decided NOT to press to my friend about this. Thank you so much for the insight and opinions. This has been something I've been way overthink about ha ha. Guess should not let the overthinking mind of mine gets the better of me. Again, thank you for the feedback. Very much appreciated. I think I'm going to delete it in 48 hours. Thank you once again as this is just for personal insight so I can navigate my overthinking ha ha

EDIT 2: Hi, Everyone. It is kinda overwhelming seeing a lot of people navigate me through this overthink of mine haha. Bet, hey, overthink must have happened due to some things right?? Well, is it okay if I explain it in a bit?? It's okay if this continues with people calling me an AH, just as long as it's not my friends. And, I'm here for an open ears haha.

The reason why I've been overthink these past few nights about this is because of a moment in my new group where it felt like...how do I say it? You know when you felt like you're in a group where, even without telling, they accepts you to be a part of the group just based on how they treat you? That is exactly how I feel. And second, why I start to overthink is because by now, I kinda see how in my previous group, I feel like I'm the only excited one, the one who puts all of her energy and efforts into it, while the others are sorta....there. I don't want to be that person, but somehow, in my current new group, I feel like my efforts and energy are as equal, if not, was reciprocated by them. Hence, why I start questioning all these. And lastly, there are instances where I realized, which still haunts me to this day, that I think I was kinda lonely in my previous group. So basically, these three points are the highlights. Again, I'm open to criticism and questions if anyone wants to ask. No worries, I'm not gonna hate y'all for this ha ha. It feels good to know someone can help me navigate this overthink-mess-kin-of. So, thank you once again.  Appreciate every single one of you.

47,1gr2aic,AITA for deleting my younger sisters accounts.,"I (F26) and my (F12) sister have always ‘disliked’ each other and ‘tried’ to one up each other. Whatever I did eg. go out to the mall, get a boyfriend. She would try to ‘copy’ most of the things I did, but my mother (F48) wouldn’t allow her because she is still a kid

I talked with my mother, and she said my sister had been spending an excessive amount of time on these platforms, neglecting her responsibilities and has been giving a really bad attitude which you might say is typical teen behavior. But this carried into school.Her grades were suffering, she had outside friends, but the way she treated/acted towards them is not okay. (if they said something she didn’t like she would immediately get defensive and cuss them out.)

It was when I realized that her behavior was escalating, and her obsession with these platforms was ‘controlling’ her overall well-being in a negative way. She stopped doing what she was asked and kept in her room all day. The final straw was when she stopped going to school. I didn’t think twice and deleted her roblox and discord account. (Since they both can’t delete instantly I did change the password and set them to delete. However, for roblox it was different. I did contact them and am still waiting back if they say no then I’m going to leave the account untouched.).

That being said, I recognize that my actions may have been seen as extreme by some. Deleting someone's accounts, especially without their consent, can be considered a breach of trust. But you have to understand at that moment that she was throwing her life away. Going to school is a big thing that decides your whole career, skills, social life, everything. I do admit I could’ve gotten our parents involved, but my mother was just so done and gave up that I found a solution for her.

Now, I’m facing the consequences of my actions, and my sister is currently not talking with me and when she does, she just yells at me. My friends and some of my siblings think IATA, but I really don’t think I am.

48,1gr26hw,WIBTA If I continue with my plan to study abroad despite my Mother's thoughts regarding it. (Turkey to England.),"Hello everyone, first time posting here, I think a little bit of my backstory is in order for everyone to get the full picture here.

I (17M) am half English and half Turkish but I have lived in Turkey for my whole life despite basically being raised as a Brit thanks to my father even though I live with my mother; Yes, my parents are divorced, they have been since I was 6 years old.

Now, I'm going to be completely honest with you lads here, I fucking hate the everliving shit out of Turkey. Mostly because of how the people treat me, and the fact that they have voted for the same guy that's taken  our economy and butchered it. Another main aspect is the intense governmental control over everything, most recently banning Discord etc.. And then with how some people treat me with disdain over learning that I'm not a muslim but that I'm an Orthodox Christian, they see me as a second class citizen, i've actually been beaten for it a couple times at my high school. 

Anyway, sorry for the big rant there but the point i'm trying to get across is that I don't want to remain in Turkey any longer, and the easiest and honestly best country for me would be England. Mainly because i both have an English passport etc, and that it's my first language. And I already know what I want to study which is Law, so that I can further down the line become a prosecutor.

My father has been greatly in support of this plan, and has offered to provide financial help where and whenever he can, my mother however... has different thoughts regarding it, it is obvious that she is at the very least *hostile* regarding it, very recently we have gotten into an argument where she stated stuff like ""So, you are just going to abandon me?"", ""Most *normal* kids are fond of their mothers."", ""I raise you up for 18 years just for this?"" ""You are a narcissist"" and a few more that my tired brain can't remember currently.

So this morning I was low on fuel and in a rush did what I have to do and was left with 5 miles to the nearest garage driving down got stuck in traffic and had to walk the last mile. 

I get to the garage and start filling as I was paying a older guy like late 50’s asked if I was the one that he saw on the way up he offered a lift back down to my car ok no problem I thanked him for the lift. 

 on the way down he got a bit weird in my opinion he offered to go to his house to get a can for fuel I have fuel enough to get to the garage so I thanked him for the offer but declined. 

he then started to try turn off the road I said to him thanks for the lift but I’m this way if your busy I can just walk the rest of the way he locked the doors and said “oh sorry I forgot let’s get you back” 

more small talk and he started to ask weird questions “does anyone know where you are” “where do I live” etc when we got back to the car I thanked him again and started to try get out 

he said oh I live just down this ally let’s go down and get the van it’s heavy I will need your help red flag I told him I should have enough fuel to get to the garage. 

I didn’t have a proper funnel so I used what I had but some fuel started to go on my hand. 

so anyway I filled up and he says oh your hands are covered in fuel why don’t you come back to my house to wash your hands and I’ll put your coat in the wash real quick.

At this point alarm bells are ringing I said thank you again asked for his name and he started to look like he was thinking for a good 6-7 seconds before answering. 

He then asked again am I sure I don’t want to come over to get cleaned up so I told him a little bit blunter look I really am appreciative but I have to go to work I’m sorry but I have to go. 

I just thought weird guy till I told my wife about this and she said he might just be lonely and looking for someone to talk to and that I was a ahole to the guy who was just being nice but it’s still weird in my opinion.

50,1gr10pe,AITA for telling my friend she can get back in touch when she stops being perpetually busy?,"So, long story short: I've had it with one of my friends. We've known each other for about 12 years (met at uni, now we're mid-30s). She's the ""permanently busy"" type - if you know, you know. Always doing something, can't be alone with her thoughts for one second, hyper-extroverted, etc.

She's a nice person but that pattern of compulsive ""busy-ness"" got on my nerves from the start. Like...after we graduated she worked part-time. That's it. For extra money she let out the other three bedrooms in her house. No kids, no dogs, no serious partners, no ailing relatives. And despite working maximum 2-3 days a week from 8 to 3, she was almost impossible to get a hold of. I lived 30 minutes away ON FOOT and we'd still see each other every 3-4 months at best. And every time, the spiel was ""I know it's been ages but I'm just so *BUSY!*"".

A few years ago I moved so we're now in different countries. I tried to stay in touch via WhatsApp but even that's been falling apart. Over the lockdown she got married and had two kids. So you can imagine how hard she is to get a hold of now that she actually has responsibilities and isn't just busy being busy.

So for the past year now our interactions have dwindled down to me sending her life updates and asking about hers...and her getting back weeks later if I'm lucky, months later or not at all if I'm not, with a generic *""so sorry, been so busy but you're in my thoughts, how are you x""*. Meanwhile she's still pretty active on social media and regularly posting about all the fun things she gets up to with all those other people.

**So** to cut a long story short, I decided this means she's just not interested and trying to tell me nicely. I mean...how else *am* I supposed to take barely answering me, and if so mostly just to remind me for the millionth time of *just how BUSY* she is, while simultaneously showing off all the things and people she \*does\* miraculously find the time for?

**Now here's the kicker.** She messaged me about three months after my last message, once again with a generic *""so sorry, so busy, how are u xx*"". And I chose not to respond because I'm over it. A month later (last week) it was my birthday, and she sent a birthday message and sounded quite upset I hadn't responded to the previous one.

I responded by telling her what I said in the title: ""What's the point of messaging you anyway, when I already know how it's gonna go? I'll pass. Let me know if you ever get less permanently busy and can keep in touch on a more substantial level than getting back to me months later just to remind me of how busy you are"".

I heard through the grapevine (mutual friends/acquaintances) that she's upset at how I talked to her. But I don't think I'm in the wrong here. Am I obligated to keep making an effort for someone who just can't or won't reciprocate? *And FFS - isn't it bizarre to get upset when someone you clearly don't care enough about to make an effort to include in your life, lets go?*

ETA: ""update"" in the comments.",No A-holes here,2024-11-14,"AITA for telling my friend she can get back in touch when she stops being perpetually busy? So, long story short: I've had it with one of my friends. We've known each other for about 12 years (met at uni, now we're mid-30s). She's the ""permanently busy"" type - if you know, you know. Always doing something, can't be alone with her thoughts for one second, hyper-extroverted, etc.

She's a nice person but that pattern of compulsive ""busy-ness"" got on my nerves from the start. Like...after we graduated she worked part-time. That's it. For extra money she let out the other three bedrooms in her house. No kids, no dogs, no serious partners, no ailing relatives. And despite working maximum 2-3 days a week from 8 to 3, she was almost impossible to get a hold of. I lived 30 minutes away ON FOOT and we'd still see each other every 3-4 months at best. And every time, the spiel was ""I know it's been ages but I'm just so *BUSY!*"".

A few years ago I moved so we're now in different countries. I tried to stay in touch via WhatsApp but even that's been falling apart. Over the lockdown she got married and had two kids. So you can imagine how hard she is to get a hold of now that she actually has responsibilities and isn't just busy being busy.

So for the past year now our interactions have dwindled down to me sending her life updates and asking about hers...and her getting back weeks later if I'm lucky, months later or not at all if I'm not, with a generic *""so sorry, been so busy but you're in my thoughts, how are you x""*. Meanwhile she's still pretty active on social media and regularly posting about all the fun things she gets up to with all those other people.

**So** to cut a long story short, I decided this means she's just not interested and trying to tell me nicely. I mean...how else *am* I supposed to take barely answering me, and if so mostly just to remind me for the millionth time of *just how BUSY* she is, while simultaneously showing off all the things and people she \*does\* miraculously find the time for?

**Now here's the kicker.** She messaged me about three months after my last message, once again with a generic *""so sorry, so busy, how are u xx*"". And I chose not to respond because I'm over it. A month later (last week) it was my birthday, and she sent a birthday message and sounded quite upset I hadn't responded to the previous one.

I responded by telling her what I said in the title: ""What's the point of messaging you anyway, when I already know how it's gonna go? I'll pass. Let me know if you ever get less permanently busy and can keep in touch on a more substantial level than getting back to me months later just to remind me of how busy you are"".

Me: i mean he grew up in a different time where feminism was just starting to come a issue. But being that it shouldn't be a issue anymore yet woman claim they're still victims understanding this and the reasons behind it is crucial to seeing who the right woman to date is. I don't see a problem with her claim that women are oppressing themselves for doing porn for nasty disgusting men. This woman isn't covering her face and also is n the presence of other men without her boyfriend so finding her discrediting because of where she's from or what religion she isnt doesn't seem like a logical reason

Me:Was the ""like a man"" necassary?
Mom:To him it will mean more
Me:That's not what I adked

Mom: he would apolagize if he made a mistake and now you need to put your big boy pants on and just apolagize NO MORE TEXTING TONIGHT I WON'T ANSWER
Me: Well, that has nothing to do with what I've said. I'll apologize to him tomorrow then because obviously you and I need to have a talk about what appropriate comments are. I was gonna do it today without you telling me to do it. Now I feel like if I do it I'm doing it for you and that's not gonna happen.

I told her next year I don’t want to spend any money.

53,1gqzxaw,AITA for asking my sister to take her cat with her?,"Long time lurker, first time poser. Sorry for the formatting, on mobile. 

My (28m) sister Jenny (20f) went through a very rough patch mentally after Covid ended. Her therapist and doctor suggested she gets herself an emotional support animal. At that time, Jenny was still living with my mom, but has since moved to a different city for university. She lives in a flat there and usually comes home during weekends.

Back then, I suggested a dog to Jenny because it also gives her a reason to get out of the house daily, but she decided to get a cat. Don’t get me wrong, the cat is very sweet and I like him, but the issue is that my wife (28f) is VERY allergic to cats. To the point where medication doesn’t work and she can’t breathe if she’s in a closed space with a cat. Furthermore, an allergic reaction leaving long-term consequences on her throat would mean the end of her career (she’s a singer). Since we live and work abroad, we can only visit our families maybe once or twice a year. So, she couldn’t visit my home town for a couple of years now. My mom and my wife have a great relationship, but they obviously don’t see each other as often as they would like. Paying 80-100$ for a hotel per night in the only hotel in town also isn’t an option in the long-run, as we want to save up for a house.

My other sister is also affected by the cat, although not to the extreme extend we are. When she (30f) was pregnant, she told my mom she wouldn’t bring her child and partner to her place if the cat remained at mom’s because BIL is also allergic to cats. After she gave birth, they visited mom on several occasions, since they want their daughter to have a relationship with grandma. BIL sucks it up for the sake of the little one, but he sneezes almost constantly and has a runny nose. This is somewhat alleviated by medication, but it’s still a struggle for him as far as we can tell. 

My mom (55f) also seems irritated by the cat now because she would like to travel and visit us abroad but can only do so for a couple of days because of the cat. Cat hotels are expensive and we can’t afford them for extended periods of time. My mom also doesn’t want to inconvenience my friends to watch the cat when she is gone. It bothers her, but she won’t say anything to Jenny to keep the peace. 

I suggested that Jenny should take her cat to live with her at her flat. I think it’s unfair my mom has to bear the burden of having to take care of the cat during the week just so that Jenny can snuggle with it during weekends. My older sister also agrees and tried talking to her about it but this always leads to her crying and shouting. We are all exhausted but feel like we shouldn’t let our partners suffer because of a cat.

CONTEXT: My (M25) and my girlfriend (F25) both work 45+ hours per week in restaurants. She is very extraverted and I'm very introverted.

A couple of nights ago, we both got off work late after our closing shifts. She came over to spend the night and we talked and ate a quick snack. She wanted to smoke to help her wind down for bed, so we go outside to smoke. We start smoking and talking and we stay outside for atleast an hour. At some point in her venting about her day I pulled out my phone to scroll through social media or look at memes or something. She took it very personally that I was not invested in her story and still engaged. 

  
In the moment, I felt a little attacked and caught off guard because that was never the intention. I guess from my perspective the only time I ever want to smoke is at the end of a long day to help decompress. Often when I get high, I stop being social and just want to turn my brain off for a bit. Especially at 1am after we had both just worked 10+ hours that day.

The only thing they never managed to get away was my drawing and writing. Only a pen, paper and my mind was needed. 

Recently I started drawing again more and this is an entire process since I can't draw on the computer. 
It means I spend hours drawing, then cutting out and scanning in layer per layer. An editor then helps me smooth the colours.
I usually have a drawing with a theme and a story behind. 
I have made friends through an online game and I spend time drawing pfp for it. 
A few of the friends had send my art to the developers of the game for new hero introductions. This got attention and I was asked to make something. 
I had just finished a drawing I had worked on for 7 days and I loved it. So I send that one in through a friend. 

Yesterday that friend told me, which I first assumed was a joke, he named the drawing after himself and that it was based on something 100% unrelated. 
When he asked in the groupchat if I was mad I said yes. After that it went quiet. 
Nobody else spoke up so I started thinking I overreacted. And shouldn't be mad. 
But the emotions, the trauma, it all started spreading and I felt like my art was taken away. That what my parents failed, he succeeded. 
I started crying while trying to draw, had a panic attack and destroyed my latest drawing in the process. 

So I decided I best left the group for a while to calm down and reset my emotions. I had told our main leader. 
Of course people reached out, i just told I would be back after calming down a bit and placing these emotions before I did something dumb and started an argument or lashed out to someone telling me to just ignore it. 

The friend who named the drawing and made a fake story on it has not reacted to all. Which also only makes me more annoyed at it all. 
It is making me also think I overreact. 
And that I am the AH for making a drama of it.

Nobody else spoke up so I started thinking I overreacted. And shouldn't be mad. 
But the emotions, the trauma, it all started spreading and I felt like my art was taken away. That what my parents failed, he succeeded. 
I started crying while trying to draw, had a panic attack and destroyed my latest drawing in the process. 

So I decided I best left the group for a while to calm down and reset my emotions. I had told our main leader. 
Of course people reached out, i just told I would be back after calming down a bit and placing these emotions before I did something dumb and started an argument or lashed out to someone telling me to just ignore it. 

The friend who named the drawing and made a fake story on it has not reacted to all. Which also only makes me more annoyed at it all. 
It is making me also think I overreact. 
And that I am the AH for making a drama of it. 

AITA for reacting angrily and also withdrew because he named my drawing after himself and spun a fake story on it? 

Edit1: The art has my watermark on it and my name. The developer knows he dindn't make it. ",0.0,-0.010443383,0,1

All names are fake. Obligatory Throwaway, on mobile and long time lurker first time poster.


This is less of an AITA, and more of an asking for any advice you can give me. 


Earlier today, some friends (14 - 17 M & F) and I (17M) were playing truth or dare. Through one of the truths, a friend ‘Jay’ (15M) revealed that he is Gay, but saying that he asked a guy out. A little while later (after some new people had joined) the following interaction occurred:

Me to Jay: “do you still like him?”

Jay: “Who?”

Someone else (I didn’t see/hear who it was): “The guy”

As soon as I say the word “him”, I realised what I’d done, and now I’m trying to figure out what I can do. I don’t necessarily want him to still consider me a friend (it would suck to lose him as a friend, but if he doesn’t want to be around me anymore I will respect that boundary), but I do need to figure out how to apologise to him. This is my last day of school, so I’m not going to see him in person again, and any interactions will have to be over the phone.


I’m also going to add, so you don’t think I did this on purpose/maliciously, that I am gay, and was outed. 


TLDR: I accidentally outed a friend, and I can’t figure out how to apologise. ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-14,"AITA For Accidentally Outing a Friend?

She recently started driving lessons and will have driven the supervised required amount of time to get her license in two or three weeks. I am older than this friend and have had my permit for longer than she has. Despite me having my permit for longer, I only have 1/3 of the supervised drive time needed to attempt getting my license. This is because I am not enrolled in any sort of driving lessons or driving school and my parents don't take me driving very much. My dad offers to take me each weekend, but never follows through and actually takes me. My mom is very impatient and often yells at me while I drive. She also doesn't let me drive anywhere further then 10 minutes from our house. This makes it so im only ever logging very small amounts of driving, (usually 2 ten to five minute drives logged a week at most).

I know this is kind of stupid but I'm jealous of my friend. I'm older than her but she'll already have her license in no time AND she got a car for her birthday so she'll be able to drive wherever whenever pretty much. I feel like I'm behind because I dont have a car and I don't have a license, and I'm not close to getting either and that's the part that makes me most jealous I think. I feel really bad but I just cant shake the jealous feeling.

I know that if I asked her to take me she would say yes in a heart beat but she's gotten hit (by other drivers in the wrong, not her fault) two times in the last 3-4ish years and I think it would stress her out. I decided to talk to my mom if she could either start taking me driving consistently and for longer (like for 1-2 hours each Sunday or Monday or both cuz those are her days off) or if she could sign me up for driving school. (I feel bad cuz it's expensive but I still felt like bringing it up as an option. Id be willing to pay for part of it.) Well before I could even mention the driving school option, my mom cut me off. She got upset with me and told me she couldn't take me because it was super late at night (it was 7:30) and she just got home from work and she was too tired to take me driving.

60,1gqxycz,AITA for asking my wife for accommodations on difficult family travel?,"My wife is from China, I'm from Germany, and we live in the US. Her family lives in China, mine in Germany. We've been traveling together to see both families about once a year. When going to China we would usually fly from the US West coast to Shanghai and take a train to her hometown — a pretty direct route. We would also stay with her parents (at their insistence) in their small 2-bedroom apartment. During those stays I witnessed many a shouting match between my wife and her parents; her relationship esp. with her mom is poor.

We learned in early 2022, before China lifted its COVID border lockdown, that her dad was diagnosed with multiple myeloma (blood cancer). The following months she tried to arrange a trip to China, but flights were VERY expensive ($8000+). Her mom and brother were recalcitrant on bringing her dad to his scheduled treatments — ""We know your dad is going to die soon, why spend money on medical treatments?"" During this time my wife was suffering mentally a lot. In late 2022 Hong Kong finally allowed in visitors with 3 days of self-quarantine, so we booked a flight to HK, and she crossed the border into China from there. She spent 2 months with her parents and made sure her dad got to see all his doctors.

In Oct 2003 China had lifted COVID restrictions and we booked another trip. For good reasons that aren't relevant my wife asked for us to enter China from Hong Kong again, making for a much longer trip, but I agreed to this. Also this was the first time we agreed to stay in a hotel instead of with her parents because of the usual tensions now coming together with the emotional stress of her dad being seriously ill. This was my idea, but she did not argue against it and rather quickly agreed to it. We stayed 3 weeks, seeing her parents every day, taking her dad to Dr visits, before leaving in late Oct. At this point her dad seemed weak but stable.

On Jan 1 we get a call from my wife's sister that their dad had just passed away. We book a same-day trip to China (again through HK) to partake in funeral traditions.

Now, one year after our 2023 trip, we are planning a trip for the burial of her dad's ashes. Again we go over trip logistics, and we get into an argument. My wife says that I am too controlling about our travel logistics and that, really, she had preferred to stay with her parents during our 2023 trip because it was the last time she got to see her dad. I say that I was agreeing to the long route via HK, and that she had agreed to the hotel stay in 2023, and that we had gotten to see her dad every day, and that at the time we couldn't know that he would pass away so soon. To which she replies, regardless of all this, if I hadn't been there in 2023, she would've stayed with her parents rather than a hotel, and that I should have known her well enough to know this.

I'm hurt that she now uses my choice to accompany her to see her ailing father to accuse me of thwarting her final weeks with him. Am I the asshole?

I always thought I was the only one who saw this in her and never directly told anyone about it. There have been past situations that make me feel this way, but I digress.

On the day of the wedding I was, of course, super stressed. We had a problem with our catering service. Thankfully we got it all sorted out. After the ceremony I went to go see Sophia and some other friends. I was shocked when I saw her wearing a white dress. Yes, it did have some flowers on it, but still!

While I tell her these things, the most important part for this situation is that it’s an online class and the exams are also online. 

B proceeds to tell me that I should take photos of the exams and send them to her. I was shocked and laughed it off because I thought B was joking. That’s textbook academic dishonesty/cheating, and I ain’t about that.

63,1gqxgta,AITA for telling my friend and project partner to take time off?,"Hey guys. I’ve never posted here but to be fair I really need some insight. Me (22M) and my friend (21F) have been working on a comic for almost 5 years. It is a project I truly love, I think about it every day and I really want to see it through. However, I do not know if my friend feels the same way. She says she does, but her actions don’t make it seem that way. I have struggled with this feeling for a while now, almost a year. And finally today I exploded because i feel she doesn’t care as much for it as I do and it’s frustrating.
So for context, I am the writer and she’s the illustrator. We worked on the story and everything to have all in place, so now after a few years I finally wrote a bit; two chapters. We always teased each other about finally doing “our jobs”, so I thought that finally giving  her something tangible would make her more prone to work on her part, like doing some sketches of the characters or trying things out with their designs. However, it’s been a month since I told her to check the chapters out and she still hasn’t done it. 
She is a busy girl I might clarify. She is close to becoming a nurse, so she is doing her internships and everything. However, I am also busy, mostly with things around the house and my senior project, though I will start work next month. The main difference I feel is that despite not having much free time when I do I try to use it all in the development of this comic, but when she is free she prefers to do other stuff; she procrastinates a lot. And ngl I do so too, I am diagnosed with ADHD and I suspect she might be AuDHD, but that’s besides the point. The thing is I understand she might sometimes not feel like it, that she might be too tired and overwhelmed, but then again she never “feels like it” when it comes to working on the comic. 
But I also feel like that, most of the time too, but I usually turn to this because I find comfort, joy and fun in working on this story. And I feel she does not and that difference is what makes me upset. Because despite her saying she does love this project, that difference is what strikes me.
So finally today after she told me she was doing an animatic of another thing she’s into I blew off. She always has time and will for every other thing but like I said it’s been a month and she still hasn’t checked the chapters. But she has time to do a whole animatic? And don’t get me started on how many illustrations (full and colored) she has done compared to the ones of our characters; she has barely finished one in all our years working together, while she does like 2 or 3 of her other stuff a month.
I told her i wanted to take time from working on the comic. I feel frustrated and upset, not seeing the same level of commitment and interest that I have. I don’t wanna ruin the friendship but I’ve been holding this inside for a long time. I might focus in my own projects, cuz I have them.

64,1gqxb5p,AITA for not take my girlfriend to jury duty? ,"   About a month ago, my girlfriend got selected for Jury Duty. She hates driving so I said I would be able to take her. We are both 20, so this was the first time either one of us have had to do this. She said she had to go early in the morning. This work out for me since I had work at 4pm. I was under the impression that she had a case and it would only be a few hours. 
   A few days before jury duty she brought it up in a conversation with my mom. My mom told her that typically it’s a all day ordeal. I told her I would figure something out. Fast forward to the night before. She tells me that she has to be at the courthouse by 8am. I tell her that’s fine and I ask her when she will be done, and she said that they didn’t tell her. So I looked on line and it was saying 4pm, when I have to go to work. 
   I told her I’ll tell my boss I’ll be 20 mins late.He would have been cool with it, but she doesn’t what me to do that. I told her I’ll dive her car to the courthouse and ride my bike back. It’s only a 30ish min bike ride and I love to ride my bike, but she says no to it. I even tell her I can drop her off and see if my mom can pick her up, she still said no. 
   She then got pissy at me saying that’s she disappointed and that I promised her I would take her. She was the one who waited to the night before to call, and I was just working with what I had. I understand that I promised her. I wish timing would have worked out better and maybe I should have figured out how long it was going to take before I promised her. But hindsight is 2020 and we were both under the impression that it was only going to take a few hours in the morning. 
   She said she was sorry for the way she talked to be that night, but she said that she can’t help but feel disappointed and has been distant for the rest of the day. AITA?


Note: I don’t know if this changes your opinions much, but there’s is a detail I have to clarify. She never asked me to take her. I offered my self. She can and will drive herself. The courthouse is about a 15-20 min drive and basically all new roads we never have a reason to head over in that direction. She dose get road anxiety and in her own words “I need time to prepare my self before driving to a new place” or something very close to that. She was frustrated at the fact that up until the last min she was going to get a ride. When she realized that I could make it happen without inconveniencing someone she just accepted that she was going to have to take herself. 

She has admitted that the situation wasn’t my fault, she said that she just can’t help but feel disappointed. I think more so because I didn’t try to figure it out before the night before, but I still offered different solutions.

66,1gqwyf8,AITA for wanting my boyfriend to clean up more,"EDIT: I want to mention that I do everything around the house and 100% of the cooking. I’m not sitting around twiddling my thumbs.

I (19f) have been with my boyfriend (25m) for 8 months, we’ve been living together for 2 months. We live in his family's house that's on an 8 acre citrus farm. The property has been neglected, so he's helping clean up and maintain it. He works outside every morning for 4-5 hours. The work contributes to his family letting us live here and not pay for rent or utilities, though I have offered to pay for rent before and his mom turned my offer down. I just moved to his area, so I'm still looking for a job.

I thrive in a house that's clean and clutter-free, but my boyfriend on the other hand does not care and will leave a mess around the house and it won't get cleaned unless I ask him (sometimes asking doesn't even work) or do it myself which upsets me because then I feel like his mother.

When we eat, he'll often forget his dish and just walk away. I have reminded and asked him multiple times to grab his dish when he gets up, if I ask him in the moment that he's walking away he'll grab it. But if I don't ask him and I don't get it for him, he won't get it until the next time we sit there. We recently talked about this, he said that the dishes are ""ours"" and wonders why I don't get it if it bothers me. I've tried to explain that when I do that, I feel like his mother. He says that he usually forgets to grab his dish and that he ""can't change who (he) is"" and that it's just a fault he has. But, he has told me that I should ""change myself"" and not let it bother me so much.

He will strip from his dirty clothes in the TV room and leave them on the floor for awhile. He often leaves them in the walking path too, so it's not out of the way. Him leaving it there bothers me a lot, which he knows, and he thinks I'm being petty for not picking it up since it bothers me so much.

He acquired a large tortoise that lives in our backyard, which has concrete. It mostly shits near the door, which he doesn't clean up often. He also takes awhile to clean up her pee spots which she also does a lot on the concrete. I asked him if he could clean it up, since I/we also like to sit outside there and the sight of the poop and pee spots are gross to me, and it also stinks. He told me that I should clean it if it bothers me. I told him that it's his pet and that he should be the one to clean up after her, and he told me that it's ""our"" tortoise. But, I wasn't asked if I wanted a tortoise or if I wanted to help in the cleaning of it which I don't. Is it wrong for me to want him to clean up after it and not do it myself?

69,1gquvej,AITA for not volunteering to help out in a family New Year's Holiday?,"Posting here was my boyfriend's idea as he too is tied to this as well. 

Every year, my extended family hosts a Christmas and New Year's party, either at my grandma's house or a holiday home/AirBnb. Since my family lives overseas, I (26 F) will be flying back to celebrate with my extended family. This year will be the first year my boyfriend (29 M) celebrates Christmas with the family and I was so excited to show him my culture's Christmas traditions, plus see the crazy stuff that happens.

Sadly, this year is going to be different as not everyone is going to be around for Christmas, so the big reunion is going to be during New Year. My aunt announced plans to book a huge Airbnb to fit nearly 20 family members for three days and was doing a headcount on the family group chat. Something to know about my extended family is that each of them has a live-in housemaid who does all the cooking, cleaning, etc, and apparently, none of them are going to be around during the New Year season. Since no ""staff"" were tagging along, this meant that the Airbnb plans could be cancelled and we're just going to celebrate at my grandma's house.

Suddenly, my uncle had this ""great"" idea to have my mum do the work since my family had been doing our own chores for a long time since we left the country. Mum and I talked over the phone and she told me, my brother, and my boyfriend, to consider ""volunteering"" so we could do this Airbnb trip. 

Here's where I (and my boyfriend) could be the asshole. When I told my boyfriend this, he was like ""HELL NO."" Not only was he opposed to work during the holiday, but he was opposed to BOTH OF US (and my mum as well) doing ALL the work. He saw it as the extended family asking the ones living overseas with no live-in maids to cook and clean for 20+ PEOPLE. And not gonna lie, I agree with him.

My boyfriend isn't opposed to helping out if it is just a few of my relatives, like my grandma, my family, and maybe a few aunts or cousins. But for over 20+ family members, most of which are adults btw, my grandma, and a baby, it's too much. It's free labor. Even if we're not paying a cent for Airbnb, we had to fork our own money just to fly back. So I told the family group chat that he and I would only volunteer under the condition that EVERYONE in the family (all 20+ members, except the baby and grandma) help out. I don't know if my cousins know how to cook and clean for themselves, but I've seen my aunts and uncles do it so it shouldn't be an issue.

So far, there haven't been any updates and the only people who have confirmed to volunteer are my mum and my brother, which is sad cuz, to me, it feels like the family is asking the ""foreigners"" or ""those who left the country"" to do all the work. No one has messaged me about changing my mind just yet, but usually, by this point, the plans for the holidays would have been set in stone by now.

My (30M) girlfriend (28F) is very extroverted and really enjoys big activities, socializing, and other things that generally require a lot of energy.

I like socializing and doing activities every now and again, especially if we're in a situation that calls for it (i.e. karaoke at a birthday party, going out for drinks, etc.) but generally I like to keep to myself. It's relaxing to stay indoors and do calming activities.

Recently my girlfriend asked me if I would have an at-home karaoke session with her. We've done this before at different social events, and I don't mind it when the time is right, but I really didn't have any interest in singing into a microphone in my own home.

71,1gquqrf,AITA for not allowing my grandmother to bring alcohol to my son's 1st birthday?,"My son is turning 1 this weekend and I F(34) am having a birthday party with the family at home to celebrate. 

I've decided to serve champagne, enough for each person to have 1-2 glasses, but have asked people not to bring any alcohol with them. This is because of my grandmother/mother's behaviour at my neices first birthday where they drank a lot, spilt wine on the carpet and presents and just bad behaviour all round. My mother doesn't have a great relationship with myself and my sisters due to substance and mental health issues and because of how her and my grandmother act when they get together when alcohol is involved, ive decided to only invite my grandmother who I have a pretty good relationship with overall. 

However, she seems to be taking issue with me not allowing her to bring alcohol. I told her I'd 'probably serve some champagne' and the following day she rings me, again asking about bringing alcohol as she 'cant see herself going all afternoon without a drink'.

I've decided to serve champagne, enough for each person to have 1-2 glasses, but have asked people not to bring any alcohol with them. This is because of my grandmother/mother's behaviour at my neices first birthday where they drank a lot, spilt wine on the carpet and presents and just bad behaviour all round. My mother doesn't have a great relationship with myself and my sisters due to substance and mental health issues and because of how her and my grandmother act when they get together when alcohol is involved, ive decided to only invite my grandmother who I have a pretty good relationship with overall. 

However, she seems to be taking issue with me not allowing her to bring alcohol. I told her I'd 'probably serve some champagne' and the following day she rings me, again asking about bringing alcohol as she 'cant see herself going all afternoon without a drink'.

72,1gqugix,WIBTA to ask my (separated) husband for the key back to my house?,"I (45F) am separated from my husband (41M). We have two kids in primary school.   

The kids and I moved into a house in March while my husband stayed in our old apartment. We made a commitment to co-parent as collaboratively as possible. I gave him a key to my new home to make co-parenting more comfortable for him when I am out of town for work.

Since I moved out, I have been covering all expenses for the kids (clothes, food, school costs, etc.). I asked if he could start contributing financially because it was getting tough to do it all on my own. In August, he started giving me $200 every two weeks for the kids.

A few months ago, the shower caddy in my bathroom fell and it broke the drain stopper in the tub. I bought a new one, but had trouble with it. My husband came over to look at it and said I bought the wrong one. He said, ""Don't worry - I'll take care of it for you and the kids."" He purchased a new drain stopper and came over to install it. One week later, he sent me $180 on Venmo with an emoji of two kids (suggesting that this was the money to help with the kids' expenses). He then sent me a text that said, ""I sent you $180. I deducted $20 from the $200 to cover the drain stopper I bought and installed.""

I told him this was a miserable move on his part, but he insisted that he shouldn't have to pay for the drain stopper for my house. He deducted $20 from his kids' financial support to pay for something that his kids benefit from. So, now I want to ask him to give me the key to my house back. If he is going to nickel and dime, he should not have access to my home. The kids have everything they need at his apartment, so they actually do not need access to my house while I am out of town.

When it got closer to the event, I ended up having a work commitment that was important to me and didn't want to take time off for this concert, as it was a limited contract and I really needed the money. My friend is in law school, which isn't the easiest to take time away from but she does it quite often with enough ease.

I ended up telling her I did not want to go, as it is not in my best interest to take the time off work, as I would be missing out on a lot of money, as well as paying a ton of travel expenses to see the show. I was also not in the right headspace for personal reasons and tried to convey these points to my friend, as they were very important to me. I told her I would give her my ticket for FREE to give to someone else who would want to go more than me, because I saw the best case scenario being that she would still have someone to go with and I wouldn't have to go, even if I lost out on a few hundred bucks.

She didn't end up asking around for someone else to go with, and when I continued to tell her that I didn't want to go she angrily kept telling me how much that sucked and other aggressive language through the phone. The concert was something she was really looking forward to for these months to help with the stress of law school and a challenging time she was going through.

I did not want to go, as I had told her, but also didn't want to let her down.

75,1gqt4pl,AITA for caring about my pet?,"Am I the asshole? Me (31F) was raised by my grandparents my whole life. When I was 8, we adopted a cat because I always begged for one. But my grandparents were from an “older generation”, and since I was a kid, the cat would roam outside against my wishes. He lived for 8 years, and no loss I’ve ever experienced has surpassed what I felt when he passed away.

Then in 2013, I adopted another cat, and as an adult, I took 100% responsibility for him: feeding him dye-free food, regular vet check-ups, protective screens on windows, and no going outside. A few years later, I moved to a big city for work and have been here for a while. To avoid stressing this cat, who’s been with my family for years, I left him with them.

A few key points here: I love cats a lot. I don’t plan on having kids, and I understand that a mother’s love for a child is different from an owner’s love for a pet, but my cats are the most important thing in the world to me.

It’s also important to note that I lived with my grandparents because my parents were teenagers and were never really present. Sometimes they were physically there but never took on the responsibilities of parents—like educating, buying clothes, attending school meetings, and so on. Even now, with them having others kids, they still only seem to care about themselves.

My mom married a rich man because all she cares about is money. She’s never worked a day in her life and believes people’s value is based on what they have, not who they are. My dad has bankrupted my grandparents several times because he never wanted to work and still lives with them, dreaming of becoming a writer (even though he’s never contributed anything to the household and is almost 50).

The point is: yesterday, this 11-year-old cat had an accident involving his paw due to nodules and bled a lot; he even needed a blood transfusion. Since I live in another city, I only found out because my dad posted on social media, saying the cat had ‘scared him,’ that he has “only 5 years of life” and fucking scaring things, but he still made a point to mention that he went to the movies WHILE the cat is bleeding all over the house and even posted a review of the film. I argue with him that it was very insensitive and…he blocked me. When I told my mom about this, she said she doesn’t understand people’s feelings toward pets and that she has bigger problems, not even wanting to listen to me.

I called my grandparents to ask why they didn’t tell me the cat was hospitalized. They said they didn’t want to worry me, but they apologized and promised it wouldn’t happen again.

So here’s the question: am I the asshole for being upset that my dad posted photos of the cat just for likes, even though he went to the movies during an emergency?

76,1gqsw33,AITA for telling a friend’s girlfriend all the bad things he said about her behind her back?,"
A long time ago, I broke up with someone and ended up dating one of their long-term friends (BF), and became friends with his friends too (Simon and Penny). This provides context on how I know this friend circle. 

I’ve know Simon, BF’s friend for a long time and we’ve always gotten along. But things started to go downhill when my boyfriend began venting to Simon about me. Simon then sent me a very hurtful text, which my BF said he “consented” to, but apparently, the exact words weren’t actually agreed upon.

I was upset, and while I know I shouldn’t have, I fired back. Simon then said something that really hurt: “You’re only book smart, you should’ve known I’d definitely take his side since I knew him first.” It stung, and when I confronted my boyfriend, he kind of defended his friend, claiming it was “consented,” which caused a huge argument. We almost broke up over it.

In a moment of frustration, I decided to text Simon’s girlfriend Alyssa (at the time) about all the awful things he’d said behind her back. Alyssa dumped Simon, and things spiraled from there. He retaliated by calling my mom and spreading wild lies about me. To provide context, my relationship with my mom is distant; she’s not very involved in my life and only sends money occasionally. Simon got her number from another person in our circle, Penny, who I had helped out with money and food in the past. Not only that, but Penny then started sending me death threats for “hurting her best friend.”

Now I’m realizing how everything has gotten so out of control, and my boyfriend got caught in the middle of this mess. Part of me wants to just break up with him and walk away because none of this is worth it anymore.

Recently however he has seemingly regressed to how it was when I was younger. I attribute it to stress, but can’t find it in myself to excuse it. He recently had a minor surgery (not even out under or had any strong meds prescribed) and returned to work with little pain or complication. And yet I can’t seem to have a simple conversation with him without it becoming an issue, and my mom always takes his side on things which is incredibly frustrating because they, especially my mom, always end up apologizing retroactively.

This is about the latest incident in particular. Our dog was being reactive toward our other dog and we separated them, the reactive one is on the younger side and has received training, but has been getting more aggressive lately. So once things calmed down and we made sure our other dog wasn’t hurt I made a comment saying that “we need to get him into training” and immediately my dad snapped at me and started yelling at me. Saying there “was no we”, saying overall hurtful things to me, and then accusing me of not taking care of the dogs. Note that they have had me stay home on trips and vacations to care for these dogs and go out multiple nights a week leaving me with them, and during the day I’m usually in class or doing school work, but I let them out, feed them, and help out when I can. 

We had an argument and things got a bit heated. I didn’t quite match his tone, but I will admit that I raised my voice. I was saying that my comment was an offhand one and my word choice was not intentional in the first place, because I knew it was not worth it to even argue that I do help out with the dogs. We argued for a while more and I called him an A-hole for yelling at me out of no where and starting an argument where there wasn’t one purely over semantics. I admit it may have been out of line, but I also refuse to apologize because this is not the first time this week something like this has happened and I don’t think deserve to have someone else’s issues taken out on me.

Previously he had seizures often and was on a lot meds and he used weed to help with side effects. Since our families are close, I hang out with him, and it’s nice to talk, as I also have personal struggles.

The issue is, Mark’s parents are very strict about substance use, especially since his surgery.

He doesn’t have a job or money, but whatever he does get, he spends on edibles, gambling, and nicotine. Every once in a while I don't mind letting Mark have a hit (especially if I'm
High myself), but I don’t want him to get in trouble with his parents, or put pressure on me for giving weed to him after his surgery/potentially fueling a bad habit.

Last week, we went for a walk, and I let him use it, but he hit it several times and got super high (even though I said once), which stressed me out. Tonight, he came over, and we talked for a while.

82,1gqrol4,AITA for getting a customer Kicked out with a bad Yo Mama joke?,"When I (20M) was in college, My dorm was right next to Greek Row, so it was very common for me to run into frat guys. I don't think I need to tell you that they were usually assholes, and I grew pretty tired of having to deal with streakers, drunk guys, and constant harassment toward female dormmates. It sucked.

Fast forward to now. I work at a trampoline park. The last weekend has been a nightmare there. I was stuck with long shifts on our busiest day in months while kids were running around on slides, screaming, bleeding, etc. All of this is to say I was reaching the end of my rope a little bit. 

We were about 10 min from closing, and the park was empty except for us, 1-2 families, and a group of high school boys. All day they had been causing trouble. Now, they were bothering my 22F coworker, R. This one guy (D)(18M), was trying to flirt with her, by insulting her makeup and then begging her for her snap. She kept telling D to f off but he wasn't taking the hint. 

I was close by when this was all happening, keeping an eye on the other guests. R seemed like she could handle it so I just stayed close in case she needed support. 

Eventually, R got fed up and decided to close the park a few minutes early to get rid of D. She had me take over while she went to the intercom. When she left, D started asking me real invasive stuff about R's sex life and of course, also asked me to give him her snap as well. I didn't know R that well and I don't use Snap, but even if I did know any of this stuff I wasn't going to give D anything. So I told him he might have better luck in the dumpster out front. 

He started yelling about how I was totally ""hitting that"" with R. At this point, even his friends were getting embarrassed by his behavior and were begging him to chill out. Before anything else happened, R's voice blared out over the speakers, telling everyone that the park was closed. The other guests started filing out, and D's friends had wrangled him enough that he was willing to leave. 

Here's where I might be TA. I was riding high watching this dude get so upset that he couldn't get his way. He reminded me of the AHs I had to deal with on Greek Row, and getting 1up felt good. Good enough that I couldn't resist pursuing it just a little bit more.

As D was leaving, I turned towards him, and in a perfectly calm, even tone, I called out to him: ""Be sure to say hi to your mom for me!""

Not the most creative comeback, I know. But it was enough. D went ballistic. He whirled around and started screaming at me, his friends holding him back. His screaming drew everyone's attention, including R, who swooped in and told D off for screaming at an employee. D's friends had to practically drag him out, apologizing profusely. 

The whole thing was a great tension reliever. My coworkers laughed at D's reaction, and I'll admit it was cathartic after the shitty weekend we had all had.

My partner suggested giving him our extra room & adding him to the lease for our apartment. I thought it was a fine idea, and he happily accepted the offer. Before we started the process, we brought him to the apartment, showed him around, and showed him the room that would be his. Everything went smoothly and we added him to our lease. Here’s where everything starts to go down hill. 

The first month, he purchased an ESA kitten, Pea. Not a big deal, my partner and I also have one. But he doesn’t take care of him. He locks him out of his room, doesn’t clean his litter box, and doesn’t feed him. At first I just thought maybe it was just adjusting to having a new pet, and new responsibilities. It wasn’t. After many conversations about taking care of Pea, he only responded with ‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry’ or nothing, and would just ignore the situation.

He hasn’t done any sort of cleaning since he moved in. Its a struggle to get him to do chores. He won’t load because he doesn’t like touching the dirty dishes. I understand that, I’m autistic, and I have to be wearing my dish gloves when I’m loading the dishwasher, because gross. When I suggested what worked for him, he got really upset and refused to talk to me for days. He still won’t come to me about things, and instead goes to my partner. 
This month however, things took a major dip. I went to the ER late one night and had a emergency surgery. I was on heavy painkillers, and slept for almost a week and a half. I got a call from the office asking about a 700$ charge that hadn’t been paid in my account. I was confused, I had mostly assumed that he would paid the rent, considering he had for the two months prior. When I brought it up to him, he insisted he sent the money, when I looked, it was for last month’s rent.  I brought it up again, trying to make it less awkward by joking around and just telling him mistakes happen. He responds by complaining to me that its going to take up all his paycheck. I told him that I could pay 100$ of it but thats genuinely all I could do, because I had been in the ER, and have missed a week and a half of work without pay. He stormed off, saying I was a bad friend. Now he’s not talking to me, and he still hasn’t paid his rent.

 I talked to my mom about it, and she said I was being too rough on him, and to offer to pay half. I told her absolutely not, and she told me I was being stuck up. So I just want to know if I’m the asshole?

She got mad at me and said he does care and that she loves making his lunches. We had a little back and forth but she ended up leaving and saying that I don't get to judge her since she didn't judge me for not making my son lunches.

I hadn't applied to any med school yet because we hadn't even had this conversation.So his reasoning was that I should just get admitted because I hadn't secured any admission into med school yet and med school is generally very expensive and we ""can't afford it"".

The fees are high but I know what my Dad earn and I can say he will be able to pay my tuition, though uncomfortably. I haven't mentioned my mum because she earns way less than he does currently so my Dad has the biggest say since he's the one providing finances. I feel like my Dad doesn't want to pay for my tuition despite his capability.He has genuinely always been very stingy and provides the bare minimum (I'm not kidding lol) He literally tells he doesn't owe us shit anymore because we(his kids) are all 18+ and the constitution does not bind us to him anymore. We've always felt like he's a sponsor and not a Dad- a sponsor who's always mad that he's got dependants.

It's almost the end of this semester, and I've hated it here. I've had  no motivation to attend classes and CS is also kinda hard. My parents had mentioned that I'll just leave this place and do medicine next year 'if we get the money' and I should just persevere in the meantime. I feel like this is an excuse so that I can find myself completing CS here. I have kept insisting on us having a meeting to plan on how we'll get resources to pay my tuition if what my dad claims is true , but they keep pushing the meeting away. I feel like my mental and emotional state, as well as my aspirations are being ignored. My dad is throwing problem statements about funds but is not willing to have a meeting to discuss solutions for them. He wants me to stop whining like a little bitch and just suck it up. My mum wants me to stay at this Uni too but I still think the longer I'm here, the more I'm cementing my stay and completion of this unwanted degree. I can't trust them with ""when we get funds you'll transfer"" when my dad has blatantly refused to buy me a laptop even though he's very capable of buying one. I mean how do I even study computer science without a fucking laptop?

We went through a lot of couples counseling beforehand so we knew what we were getting into so we just decided that instead of playing marriage we would actually get married. Anyways for my groomsmen I had 4 of my really close friends who I have known for a while and then I had my now brother in-law(18m).

We did our rehearsal and then did the whole rehearsal dinner with my huge family and my wife's small family. The whole wedding party sat at a long table facing our family so talking to each other was kind of difficult, but we managed. That night as I'm going to sleep I get a message from my soon to be sister in law(24) saying that my brother in law felt really unwanted and left out at the dinner and I need to make an effort to include him. I get pretty annoyed at this, but say something along the lines of ""I definitely will, sorry that he felt that way, I'll do what I can"". I message the other groomsmen so they are aware to include him more and many of them told me that they tried talking to him, but he just wasn't interested.

Next day I am running around doing all the last minute wedding things so my wife didn't have to deal with anything and after that its picture time! I have a blast taking a bunch of fun pictures (and serious ones too of course) with my groomsmen. Afterwards I hand the photographer a little gift I made for my wife to deliver to her(I only handed it to him and no one else). ThenI ran off to help out the guy who was doing our music figure out something really quick and when i come back my groomsmen and some of the people who arrived with them are all running around looking for my brother in law. No one knew where he was and he hadn't said anything to anyone. I call him, no answer, so queue 30 minutes of looking for him. I checked discord as a last resort and see he is playing Forza. He arrives about 5 minutes before the ceremony. Besides that the wedding was great. Later he says I told him to bring the gift to my wife (uh, heck no I didn't) and in the wedding photos the photographer took a picture of him playing said game.

He also dropped out of my bachelor party the morning of by his mom messaging me saying he was sick(He was playing forza). It was a group fund that we paid for ourselves, but because he dropped out (along with 3 other people within 48hours) I had to pay an extra $480. He has never mentioned anything about it to me.

93,1grgusa,AITA for kicking my little brother out of a conversation I didn't want him to hear?,"Sorry for any errors, not a native english speaker. 

My brother (13M) and I (17F) attended a weekend camp with many of our friends and community members (all in highschool). At camp they are very lenient about the rules, and we are allowed to stay up as late as we want, so long as we stay indoor bc there are animals outdoors at night. We all went outdoors anyways, but that's beside the point. 

My brother is the youngest in the friend group by 2-3 years. He basically got adopted into the group bc he always used to hang around me and my friends, and eventually he became friends with all of them. They all love him dearly and treat him as an younger brother, and I don't mind at all, because he doesn't have any brother or many friends besides these so I think it's good for him. 

At this camp it was late at night, possible 2am, and several of us, maybe 6-7 people were outside by the docks. Yes breaking the rules but it's fine LOL, literally nobody gets in trouble at this camp. We all started talking about our parents, childhoods, and traumas. It was amazing conversations and we were all able to connect with one another and support each other. I cried a few times, it was some really personal and deep shit that everyone was sharing. Some people starting asking me questions about my past and I wanted to answer, but not with my brother around. When I was younger, I did a lot of bad thing. Drugs, alcohol, selling my body, etc. I was only 12-14 at the time, so around my brothers age. My parent's know about all these things, but my brother only knows a little bit of the story. I do want to tell him the whole thing, I don't want to hide it, but I know he is not ready right now. He's been protected by my parents his whole life. The stuff I had to go through, he never went through. he's really naive and very emotional and sensitive. And he looks up to me a lot, so I really don't think it would be good for him to hear my story yet. When he's older, for sure. 

So, I told my brother to go inside to the main lodge. There were other friends of ours in the lodge playing games and singing karaoke so he wouldn't be alone there. He didn't want to go but I insisted. My friends thought he was okay to stay but he ended up leaving. After that I was able to talk to them freely, and after hearing me my friends agreed that it was best that my brother didn't hear all this yet. 

We all talked a bit more and then decided to go inside to the lodge. When we went in there were only a few people left and my brother looked really hurt from being left out. I sat next to him and tried to explain but he didn't seem to understand where I was coming from. I felt so bad, he looked really hurt. 

We're back home from camp rn and things are back to normal, it seems.

96,1grfuvs,AITA for refusing to pay half for a new gate?,"Obligatory throw away and on phone.

About one year ago my fiance and I purchased some land in a newly developed area. All of the houses are less than 10 years old. 
Our land is down a long driveway. The driveway is shared with another piece of land next to us.

Both the previous owner of our land and the owner of the other empty property both intended to build houses but Covid happened and they ran out of money. 

Unknown to us when we bought the land, they had both agreed to let all of the kids in the neighborhood use the land as a playground. They had also allowed the house between our property and the road to take down a section of the fence between their backyard and our driveway so they could get a trailer directly to their backyard. 

The fence panels they removed still exist and are sitting in their backyard, leaning against the remainder of the fence.

We started building a house immediately after purchase and are almost finished. We're come to realize the gap in the fence is a major problem. 

All of the neighborhood kids play together in their backyard (they have kids) and use the driveway as a shortcut to the empty section and friends houses. On multiple occasions we've had to slam on our breaks because a kid has run out of the gap, across our driveway. The driveway is a steep hill and it's not easy to stop quickly, especially trucks arriving with building supplies etc.

The gap also looks very messy. It's where they hide all of their rubbish etc they don't want seen from the front of their house but it is the front of OUR house. Garden waste, dirt etc slides off their section and onto pur driveway.

We told them we want to put the fence back up and that we would happily be the ones to do it. My husband is a builder and repairing a fence is a relatively easy job for him.

They replied that they agree because of the safety issue, which they claimed to be unaware of, but they intend to put a gate in so they can continue to get a trailer to their backyard. Initially we were against this but they made a good argument for themselves, promised to only use it a few times a year with advance permission and to always tidy up any mess. We reluctantly agreed.

Fast forward a few weeks and we get a message saying they have a quote for getting a gate installed. $700 and they expect us to pay half because it's a shared fence. We were shocked. We replied no and explained the gate is only benefiting them and that we should not have to pay for them to use our driveway. They replied that was an abrupt response and that we had told them we would happily help with the fence. I replied yes, with a fence, not a gate, and by help we meant my husband put back the original fence at no cost to anyone not fund a gate that only benefits them.

So AITA?

100,1grf6ll,AITA for thanking my wife for her bday present? ,"So my wife told me not to look at any mail or packages because she ordered me a birthday gift (didn’t even want one but that’s another conversation). We live in an apartment building so sometimes the packages either go to my front door or the front entrance. If it’s small, it will go in our mailbox. 

Anyways, I’m taking out the trash in my apartment building and see a red package in the front entrance for famous footwear with my address on it. 

I didn’t open the package. I didn’t look for it. I didn’t open the mailbox. It’s not my fault the brand is on the box. 

I send it to my wife and said “thanks for the shoes.” I didn’t think it would blow up. Maybe this is where I fucked up. 

I don’t open the package but clearly it’s some sort of shoe. I didn’t expect her to get mad but she got furious. 

She said “I told you not to look.” 

“Why do you have to put your nose in everything.” 

Maybe 30-40 more texts come. 

She starts calling me names and compared me to her cousins boyfriend, who apparently would never do this. 

Now she’s not talking to me. I didn’t even want a gift. I told her no gifts. 

Am I the asshole? 

EDIT: If she really wanted to surprise me, couldn’t she just send it to her sisters or friends place? I also prefaced I don’t want presents. I did exactly as she asked, did not look intentionally for anything.

101,1grf14c,AITAH for not letting my sister borrow my clothes,"For context I'm 16F and she is 17F. During the summer I bought a lot of new clothes since I was starting sixth form, and I'd have to wear my own clothes rather than uniform like I had in lower school. My sister is in her 2nd year of 6th form and has worn all her clothes so wants to wear mine.

Since September she has been nagging me, but I haven't been comfortable with her wearing a top I hadn't worn to school yet.This may seem selfish, but the 2 times I'd worn her clothes someone has asked me if 'it was my sisters'. I don't want her to wear a top I haven't worn yet, since I don't want somone asking me if its my sisters when it's mine, thinking its her hand me downs. I don't want to be embarrased wearing my own clothes. She is older so has never experienced something like this, so doesn't understand where I'm coming from so thinks I'm selfish. I'm 90% sure my parents think this too, but aren't getting involved since I bought my clothes with my own money. My parents are both the oldest don't understand the embarrasment of wearing hand me downs, or being recognised in your older sisters 'clothes'.

Moving on, I told her she could wear my tops once I had worn them at least once. Last week that time had come, she wore my top and I was ok. But then she went to wear another top a few days later. I feel like she doesn't understand its my closet and sees it as an extension of her own. Idk why I'm just annoyed. I don't mind her going into my closet every once in a while but its getting too frequent, it may not seem frequent but I barely go into her closet. The other day when she came into my room again to go through my closet, I asked her why she couldn't wear one of her tops, it was a genuine question, although it may have came out wrong. She was offended and just left my room and began acting rude.

I may be the AH here but I think 2 days ago, I was clearing out my room and gave her a top that I didnt want at the time, mostly because there was no space in my closet. 2 hours later I went and took it back, I had told her but she claims she didn't hear me. Today she went into my closet again and found the top, I explained the situation and she was fine with it and said she would wear it today.The problem was I hadn't worn it yet, so I told her and she got upset. I kept asking her all day if she was ok but she said she was fine.

1 hour ago my dad came into my room, and asked me if I had a problem with my sister. We talked, but he was convinced I'm lying to myself and that I don't want her to borrow my clothes. I don't mind but I just don't want it to be a frequent thing. He started basically saying that I was jealous of her and that siblings can start to hate eachother. He bascially implied I was jealous through metaphors.He said I had until he went to sleep to tell him what I wanted to do about the situation and to be honest.
