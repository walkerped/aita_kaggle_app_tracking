0,1gsafwx,AITA for not wanting a relationship with my cousin?,"I (40 F), have a cousin (J, 38 F) who has developmental disabilities (possibly Autistic) and has the cognitive functioning of a 12 or 13 year old. Despite her teachers' repeated attempts to intervene and get her support services, my aunt and uncle refused to have her evaluated. As a result, she is not very smart, has very poor social skills, and makes very bad decisions. She has a bad habit of talking to men on the internet, sending them money, nude pictures, etc., and wound up pregnant at one point, but thankfully miscarried.

My cousin's mom died when my cousin was in her early 20s, and her dad died in early 2023. Prior to my uncle's death, my sister offered to become her legal guardian, to help her with her finances and daily living. 

My cousin openly defied my sister, continued to give money to strangers, befriended a very toxic neighbor, and made false claims to Adult Protective Services against my family. My sister finally had enough and we found a court-appointed legal guardian to manage my cousin's affairs. We settled my uncle's estate, sold his house, moved my cousin into an apartment, and placed her inheritance in a trust.

My cousin flipped out, demanding the money from the trust, and continued to make false claims to APS. Eventually she stopped talking to us, though we still kept in touch with her legal guardian.

After 18 months of silence, my mom sent my cousin a birthday card with $50, and suddenly she is back in our lives. My mom is thrilled, as she feels sorry for my cousin, but the rest of our family is less enthusiastic. My cousin is coming to my parents' house for Thanksgiving, but my sister made it clear that my cousin is not welcome at my sister's house for Christmas. 

Today, my mom was talking about the upcoming holidays, and mentioned several activities she wants to do with my cousin, including going to a movie with her on Christmas Day. I said that I would probably pass on the movie. My mom expressed disappointment that I don't want to interact with my cousin, and I said if my mom wants a relationship with my cousin that I wouldn't stop her, but that I don't trust her and never will. My mom said my cousin hasn't done anything to me, and while I agreed, she has caused nothing but chaos for our family. 

My mom asked if I would ""work on this,"" and I said I would think about it, but I'm not just going to jump back in with both feet. I said that my cousin and I have never been close, and these past 18 months have shown me just how manipulative and deceitful she can be. I love my mom more than anything, but I think my cousin is a dangerous mix of stupid and spiteful, and I don't want a relationship with her.

Both she and his wife calmed him down and from what I heard from my girlfriend he admitted to overstepped due to grief as their elder brother died due to the same illness a year prior.

I asked my GF multiple times after the situation if I play around too much or was their more I can do to help her and she had no issues with my behavior and was confused why her brother was acting like that.

3,1gs9zhq,AITA for not giving my friend a ride on her birthday?,"Important context here is I (F) live in one of the biggest major cities in the US. Parking is already a pain but where I live finding parking is PAINSTAKING. Essentially if you have a car here your life has to operate around the parking situation. If youre driving on the weekdays, you have to be in and out to beat the 9-5ers for parking. And forget about even using your car on the weekends or youll be circling the block for hours. Okay important context done.

My friend (B)F invited a group of us out for her birthday dinner. One person drove, a few people ubered (including her), and I just walked to the restaurant because it was close enough to where I live. It was a fun time and the person who drove had to leave early, taking one of the people who ubered since they lived close to eachother. That kinda ended the night so we were all figuring out getting home. The last three people decided to uber together with multiple stops and invited B to come with. But she didnt feel comfortable being the last person alone on the uber (since she lived the farthest) and had also spent quite a bit on birthday festivities so didnt want to spend more money that evening, even if the cost of the uber was split.

So she turned to me because she knew I lived so close and asked if I could drop her off at hers. It was already half past 10pm at that point so I knew I wouldnt find parking anywhere near me when I got back. My exact reply back was “Im sorry, if i move my car I wont have parking when I get back but Im happy to pitch in or cover a ride back completely to yours.”

B wasnt very happy and said she didnt want to be in a car alone with a random when shes been drinking, and Im not thinking about her safety and acting selfishly towards the birthday person. I think those are all valid points but I really couldnt express how dire the parking situation was around me. 

She ended up feeling comfortable enough to grab an uber home as long as I tracked her ride, and I ended up covering it completely. But she hasnt responded to me since.

I was devastated and shaken up.the vet said she doesn't recommend us doing a biopsy or surgery as it was 15% chance her survival. The vet said she can't feel it witch it good.

6,1gs9rec,WIBTA if I didn't go to my stepdad's surprise party?,"Hi!

This is my (20F) first time posting here, so please excuse any formatting issues. 

My 39-year-old stepdad is turning 40 tomorrow. I used to think we were on good terms but every time he is home (he is only home on weekends, usually, due to his job) he insults me outright or is passive-aggressive. Now, I am autistic and struggle with social cues so he may have disliked me for a long time and I just never noticed. 

A few nights ago, I talked to my mother about my remote job and how annoying it is when I can't work due to internet/bug-related issues. My stepdad was drunk and budded in, saying, ""Well, how about you go outside and do physical labor?"" I laughed because I thought he was joking, but then he continued telling my mom, ""Something is seriously wrong with your child,"" and he kept going on about how I didn't want to work.

Mind you, I have a job, take care of the house, and my siblings, AND pay rent. Moving in wasn't even my idea. My working mom is left with 5 kids while he is at work, and she needed my help. 

Well today, I was helping my mom outside at the place we are holding his surprise party. She was also showing me where to hang the decor as she would be keeping him occupied while I set up. My mom stepped on an ant hill unknowingly and was covered in bites before she even knew what happened. I knew we were out of bug bite cream (idk what to call it) so I picked a bunch of Wood Sorrel that was in the area so I could make a paste to help with the bites. I adore herbology and wanted to put my knowledge to use. 

We went home and I immediately started working on the paste. While I was making it, she was telling my stepdad about the ants and he said, ""I'm sorry, I can't do anything to help you."" To which my mom replied, ""Oh, no worries. OP is making a salve or something."" I honestly thought he was going to be interested or something because he is also into foraging, but he said, ""Oh. So, she's wasting time then?"" and then sauntered off to go drink more in the garage.  

I'm still going to set up the party just to help my mom, but I am seriously thinking about not attending and leaving once I am finished. I know he would probably wonder where I was and be confused if I wasn't there. So, Would I be the asshole? ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-15,"WIBTA if I didn't go to my stepdad's surprise party? Hi!

He can still hear, but sometimes he speaks louder than socially accepted.

I was good with this, up until recently when he started saying embarrassing stuff in public, and not normal stuff, saying he's a 'sociopath' (He's not) and that he's gonna throw himself out of a bus, or that he's gonna steal from stores that we are inside, taking my Chromebook, screaming, trying to scare me, going underneath tables, taking my lunch bag and pretending he was just being silly etc. etc.

Here's the thing. Micheal knows I have social anxiety, to a very serious degree, and I've expressed before to him that his trying to embarrass me on purpose really bothers me. (He's said before that he knows he is embarrassing me because it makes him laugh.)

Now, yesterday, he was doing his normal shenanigans, but it was just getting on my nerves. Micheal has a very high-pitched singing voice and was singing annoying songs at school, surrounded by a bunch of kids who bullied me, and I could tell they were watching.

I lost my rag and told him ""If you don't stop I swear I'm just gonna leave."" He looked sad and quietly asked, ""Do you hate me?"" I immediately felt awful and apologized and told him that I didn't, it just bothered me when he is so loud, just to embarrass me.

I had to quit my job about 4 months ago due to an illness that had me in and out of the hospital. This illness causes high heart rate and low stanima. 

Now my only job is keeping the house neat and making food for my very busy husband. 

I have been doing as much as I can in my condition but haven't been able to stay on top of all the cleaning. I have been prioritizing things that my husband doesn't see as a priority and this makes him mad.

Because of this we have had many arguments about the housework. (I have been chalking it up to him being overwhelmed and not understanding my condition) 

Well a couple days ago he comes downstairs telling me that we have been using to much TP. It had just been my week so I was using more than usual. I explained that to him and he said durring that week it's fine but otherwise I should only use 2 squares. 

When I didn't agree right away he started to get upset so I just agreed to keep the peace.

Today he had the day off so we spent it out together.

When we went home I dropped him off and went to the grocery store and when I got back he was angry because the dishes weren't done.

We argued about it for a bit and he ended up calling me lazy. I left the room to cool down
 After about an hour he came to apologize for calling me lazy and we talked things out.

Things were going well so I decided to bring up the TP. I told him I felt like he was micromanaging and TP isn't a big expense so it was all very unreasonable. 

He got angry and started going on about how I use too much and 2 squares is all I need. I tried to correct him and say maybe it's all he needs but I am a woman while he is a man but that just made him angrier and he yelled that its all anybody needs before slamming the door and leaving.

I'm still not certain that he is actually mad about the TP since it seems absurd to me, but maybe I'm missing the point?

Is he just angry because of his stress levels or is using more than 2 squares of TP really a terrible crime?

9,1gs7yfm,AITA for telling my best friend she's causing drama?,"So, in my friend group there are 6 girls but I'll only be talking about 2. Anyways, there's this one girl, and I'll be calling her Anna for privacy reasons. Anna has been starting drama for the last 6 weeks. We've  been having arguments back to back and they all start with Anna. But for some reason Anna always targets my best friend who I'll be calling Lila, also for privacy reasons. Anna always says that Lila is being mean to her and targeting her. I have to admit sometimes Lila does get mad, and starts saying some rude things but it's not as bad as Anna says it is. For the targeting, Lila has grown to hate Anna. But Lila has really been trying to be Anna's friend. I personally don't like Anna either, because I hate drama and that's all she's been causing. Anyways, Lila, me and one other girl in the group have been planning to drop her or kick her out of the group. We haven't done anything about that yet, but Lila decided it was time. So, Lila texted me today after school telling me that she dropped Anna and sent me screenshots of her saying that she doesn't want to be her friend anymore because she's been targeting her. I haven't figured out how to show a picture here yet so I'll just copy and paste what she said and replace her name with Anna.

""hey anna ur still in our friend group but personally i dont want to be friends with you, i know u prolly dont care but i feel like every time we fight u always turn it on someone eles or say that were targerting you.
so bye! (i hope maybe you dont take this the wrong way)"" 

As soon as she sent me this I said ""Why would you do that?"" Because I just knew it was going to cause more drama and Anna was going to turn this all on Lila. I could tell just by reading it that Lila just dug her own hole. I kind of flipped out on her and said things like, ""Your just starting more drama by saying that"" and ""There's going to be so much drama now"". I honestly regret saying things like that because it was kind of rude, but I stand by it. Then Lila got upset and starting typing in our group chat that maybe she's the one starting the drama and maybe she should leave. Something in me just snapped and I gave her a very harsh reality check. I said ""Lila can u please just stop? As of right now, you are causing drama. Not even by whatever you think you did wrong but because your saying this. Nobody wants you out of the group so just stop. All this is doing is making more drama and it's not something I want to deal with right now. I'm tired and I don't want to hear you say ""I should leave"" when you know dang well that nobody wants you gone so just stop"" And now she's saying that she's not trying to be an attention seeker and she knows we hate her. I can't help but agree with her, but feel horrible. Lila is naturally a kind and amazing person and I feel like I just broke her. I feel so bad, but I don't regret saying it.

10,1gs7406,AITA for being avoidant,"I (31F) have been in s relationship with my boyfriend (34M) for just over a year now. About 90 percent of the time we have (or had) a great relationship, with common interests, inside jokes, etc. However, as time as gone on, our arguments have seemed to take a toll on me

For some backstory, my parents did not have a functional relationship growing up, usually my mom would start a conversation with my dad and he would walk out (they are now divorced). I know there’s a lot more to this than I was aware of growing up, but conflict in general is very tense for me, and I tend towards to avoidant side. I was in therapy and did a lot of work in my late 20s and thought I had made significant strides towards healthy communications in relationships, but now Im not too sure.

In the past week, I have been extremely avoidant, as it feels like any conversation that we have puts me on the brink of a panic attack, which is not something I have experienced before. As my mom lives close by, I have been spending time there and avoiding being with him but last night we had another argument and he called me out on this.

For the most part, our arguments feel very one sided – in that he will speak and any time I add a rebuttal, I will get spoken over. I try to use the “I feel….” Statements but these don’t seem to be productive. What has been sending me into a panic attack is replaying statements he has said during these arguments. I have tried bringing things up afterwards if they were hurtful, however these get said again in a later fight, with him then justifying why he said it in the first place. There have also been comments around me not liking sex or my past with other partners that replay in my mind, including when we are intimate.

For context, I haven't seen my daughters for nearly 3 years due to an ongoing custody case but I still have a load of their cuddly toys etc here.

I said I'd take this particular bag of cuddly toys to the contact centre and see if my daughter wanted them (I have 2 daughters but the eldest one is refusing to see or speak to me due to what she's been told by numerous people on her mothers side) so I did take them and my youngest daughter is a bit challenging, she's autistic and while she said she did want to see me, she spends the entire session saying she doesn't so she refused the bag. I brought it back and tonight I got asked why I hadn't taken it on Sunday. I explained I had but she'd refused them and then got told I should throw them out as it's a waste having them in the house when they aren't being used and we can just get new ones if she's still into them when I get full access back.

12,1gs6jbc,AITA for asking someone to move because they were seating on someone else's seat on Amtrack?,"I am taking an Amtrack train today. After I sat down I made acquaintances with the person who was sitting beside me. At some point, they went to the food cart to have lunch. In the meantime, the train stopped at a station and a black man (I mention the color as it becomes relevant later) got on and took seat beside me. For context, Amtrack doesn't have assigned seat and passengers are free to seat at any empty seat available. 

I don't really care who sits beside me, but by now I had built up a good rapport with my co-passenger. So, I politely told the new guy that someone was already sitting there. He asked if I knew them and I said no. He got angry and told me it's none of my business then. A conductor noticed the commotion and came up. The black man immediately accused me of being racist and not wanting to sit by a black person. I explained the situation and the conductor agreed (they have markers to see the destinations for each seat, so they knew I was telling the truth) and asked him to move.

At this point refused to move and threw a tantrum saying how he gets discriminated everyone. At this point, the conductor called for security and finally the guy moved saying the world is against black people.

I simply politely told the guy that the seat was taken and  did not want things to escalate so far. If nobody was sitting beside me already I would have no issues with him sitting beside me. I try to treat everyone fair and equal and didn't like being called racist. 

So, AITA? Was there anything I could do better to avoid the situation. Should I have simply kept quiet and let the other guy deal with it?

14,1gs5rca,AITA for refusing to go along with my family’s demands?,"I (19F) feel completely drained and defeated. My family is tearing me apart, and I’m starting to feel like I don’t even belong anywhere. I need to know if I was in the wrong here because I'm genuinely losing it.

A while ago, my friend was supposed to stay at her aunt’s, but her aunt was out of town. Dorms close at 7 PM, and it was 6:55, so I called my mom and asked if my friend could stay with us. She agreed at first but then called back saying no and that I should just give her money to leave, which didn’t make sense. I knew my aunts, (who live with my mom after she had a stroke to take care of her),pressured her into changing her mind.

I couldn’t leave my friend stranded, so I refused to go home without her. We stayed with another friend. The next day, my dad (parents are divorced) called me furious because one of my aunts complained to her husband, who called my dad to yell at me. My dad picked me up, and I spent the ride being humiliated. When I got to my mom’s, one aunt wouldn’t let me inside, saying, “Go back to where you came from.” I had to wait outside for an hour before they let me in.

Once I got in, my mom “talked” to me, which was more humiliation. Now, my parents (especially my dad) are calling me every day, which has never happened before. Today, I was studying when my dad called again, saying my aunt’s husband called him to complain. I told him I was studying, but later, he called back and started yelling, saying he was going to block me. I lost it and told my mom to tell her sister to stop calling him. My aunt (the one who hates methe most) yelled at me for speaking up and told me to stop because my mom is sick.

I snapped and told her to shut up. I overheard her later telling my other aunt that I made everything up to manipulate my mom. I called my dad to prove I wasn’t lying, and while he admitted the call happened, he turned it back on me, saying it was because I “tried running away.” My aunt laughed at my humiliation.

Now I'm going insane. They’re blaming me for everything, even saying I’m the reason my mom got sick. I’ve been isolating myself because I feel like a burden to everyone, including my friends. I feel like the worst person in the world.

15,1gs5ll3,AITA for trying to get my mum to let me be more independent,"I (21F) have graduated University and am back living with my family while I work in the area. I haven’t moved out yet as my house is in a good location (outskirts of London) for the industry I work in, and I don’t currently have the funds to rent anywhere of my own. Now I love my mum with all my heart but she has a really bad habit of being overprotective, I mean if I’m out anywhere she texts me no less than 5 times every hour and if it’s even slightly dark out that drops to basically every 15 minutes, I can’t leave the house of my own accord I have to give her a million details and also ask at least 2 days in advance, and also, and what started this argument we had, I’m not even allowed to walk from the train back to my house after work. 

For context, my house is exactly a 7 minute walk from the train station down a main road with plenty of street lamps and general public hustle and bustle. There has also never been any sort of crime around that area that would constitute being more wary than usual walking through it.

Despite all this, my mum insists on picking me up from the station every day and won’t take no for an answer, and this would be fine except her picking me up also constitutes at least 4 messages every 2 minutes asking where I am on my journey, which if I take longer than a minute or so to reply to I get spammed with more messages and in some cases a phone call. 

I have lived alone at University for 3 years, being entirely independent, and I am fine, I’m still here, so I just don’t understand why she won’t let me be more independent at home. What makes it worse is I had a job in central London during Summer and Winter holidays when I was 19 and 20, and I’d be coming home in the dark much later than I do now and back then she didn’t bat an eyelid! Maybe 1 or 2 texts but I was free to make my own way home. I’m older now and have less freedom than when I lived under the same roof back then!

Now I have to admit I’m quite an emotional person and when I feel strongly enough about something it can be hard for me to express my feelings without letting a bit of anger and tears though. And that’s what happened today when she picked me up and I couldn’t take it anymore, I told her I didn’t need picking up and could walk home alone. My mum went on the defensive saying she’s doing me a favour but I insisted over and over that she didn’t need to. She went on to say that she isn’t stopping me from growing up by picking me up from work but I told her that that’s what it feels like. She just won’t listen to me and now she’s upset which has me racked with guilt about my outburst in the first place. I know she was just doing a nice thing but I had told her before that she didn’t need to, and I just exploded.

Despite all this, my mum insists on picking me up from the station every day and won’t take no for an answer, and this would be fine except her picking me up also constitutes at least 4 messages every 2 minutes asking where I am on my journey, which if I take longer than a minute or so to reply to I get spammed with more messages and in some cases a phone call. 

I have lived alone at University for 3 years, being entirely independent, and I am fine, I’m still here, so I just don’t understand why she won’t let me be more independent at home. What makes it worse is I had a job in central London during Summer and Winter holidays when I was 19 and 20, and I’d be coming home in the dark much later than I do now and back then she didn’t bat an eyelid! Maybe 1 or 2 texts but I was free to make my own way home. I’m older now and have less freedom than when I lived under the same roof back then!

Now I have to admit I’m quite an emotional person and when I feel strongly enough about something it can be hard for me to express my feelings without letting a bit of anger and tears though. And that’s what happened today when she picked me up and I couldn’t take it anymore, I told her I didn’t need picking up and could walk home alone. My mum went on the defensive saying she’s doing me a favour but I insisted over and over that she didn’t need to. She went on to say that she isn’t stopping me from growing up by picking me up from work but I told her that that’s what it feels like. She just won’t listen to me and now she’s upset which has me racked with guilt about my outburst in the first place. I know she was just doing a nice thing but I had told her before that she didn’t need to, and I just exploded. 

So is it me, is this a non issue that I’m turning into one for no reason? Am I the asshole?",2.0,1.05449,1,0

I was staying with my best friend, M. I took a bike and visited my friend C and then spent time with M. On the last day of my visit, I had planned to see E. E is is known for being a bit insecure and clingy, especially with me. I had planned to bike over to her house at noon. We had texted about this plan and agreed on it. On that morning, I told M about my plan for the day.(She was also a friend of E) She asked if she could come too and I saw nothing wrong with that. The only problem was that M's family had plans for the afternoon and she had to be home by 12:30. I texted E that I was coming early and bringing M. (She did not respond.) 

We arrived around 10:30 and knocked on the door. No answer. We waited on the porch and then E called me on the phone, crying. She was still asleep and was not ready. She said that I always change perfectly good plans and I'm not reliable. She also said that she was upset I had brought M and wanted us to have time together without anyone else. She wished that M hadn't come and wished I had come when I said I would. She said that I should just go away and come back at noon, without M. She hung up the phone. I told M what she said but left out the part where she was not wanted. M is an awesome friend and doesn't deserve that.

We sat on the porch for a couple minutes and then E's sister came out. She said that E was unconsolable and that I needed to apologize. I said okay. E finally came out and her sister slipped back into the house. E completely changed the subject and got upset at me for not staying in touch with her. (We hadn't called or texted a lot over the last year but I did make the effort to plan time for her into my busy trip) she was crying about this and how she had missed me so much, completely ignoring what she was talking about earlier. I apologized and we spend a couple hours there without anymore drama. When I had to leave, she cried and said that we had to stay in touch more and I promised I would. Neither one of us has contacted the other since.

She clearly has been struggling with my leaving and misses me a lot, but I don't feel the same. I made new friends and kept in touch with certain old ones. I've never really felt like she was a positive person for my life and have tried to move on from her. AITA for doing this?

Recently, she was upset when she saw me measure out some baking soda with a measuring spoon, rinse it with water and no soap, and then place it with the clean dishes.

If I’d measured something liquid or sugary, I’d definitely use a bit of soap. When I measure out things like baking soda, baking powder, or salt, I give them a little rinse and call it sufficient.

Especially because when I said “so I don’t have to come?”  my boss just went mmm

I want to justify it by saying “oh at least I can hang out with my coworkers” but they’re all racist and misogynistic. I do not like them. I do not want to be around them but I need money and to keep my job.

23,1gs2m6o,AITA my bf spoils my dog too much ,"I am very close to my dog, which my boyfriend knew when we started dating. I spend a lot of time with her, she goes camping and hiking with me, and I used to take her work when I worked in the office but now I work from home so she’s with me 90% of the day. I leave her at home when I go to the gym everyday and when I go out with friends, but I am home during the days and my roommate is usually home in the evenings so she’s around people most of the time. Admittedly, she is needy and has separation anxiety and follows me around everywhere I go. But I still try to treat her like a dog. Despite her being needy, it hasn’t really affected any of my relationships.
My boyfriend is truly one of the best humans I know. He is sweet and kind and loyal and I am so thankful for him everyday. He’s an amazing person, but the only issue I have is that he treats my dog like a baby to the extent of ignoring me. I love that he loves her. But he literally carries her around like a baby, even though I’ve asked him not to and told him that it’s not good for her to give her constant attention because it makes her separation anxiety worse. It’s come to the point where he can’t even hold a conversation with me when she’s around. If his back is turned to her, he will constantly interrupt our conversation to turn and look at her and ask “what is the baby doing?” I will come into a room and he will be petting her instead of doing work. It’s like he can’t be in the same room as her without giving her attention. 
I never said anything to him or anyone else, because I felt like it was ridiculous to complain that he was paying too much attention to my dog. Again, he’s an incredible boyfriend and I do love that he loves her. 
But last night it all came out. We were sitting and cuddling and I was telling him how much I loved him, but he couldn’t even focus on me while I told him how much I love him. He kept turning to the dog to pet her. I got upset and told him that it hurt my feelings when he can’t even pay attention for me for a couple of minutes while I told him that I loved him and that it made me feel like I love him a lot more than he loves me. I’m not a super needy person and I don’t need constant assurance from my partner that they love me or constant attention, but it upset me that he can’t even take his eyes off of her for one minute. 
We talked about it, and he basically said that she is too distracting and we should spend less time with her until we build a stronger foundation because it gets in the middle of our relationship. But I don’t think the issue is spending time with her. I’ve had my dog for 6 years while with two other men (my boyfriend and I started dating this year) and it was never a problem. My dog was almost always around, but she didn’t get in between my exes and I spending quality time together. I know it’s not fair to compare exes, but she also hasn’t come in between my friendships. My roommate is close to my dog, but I never feel like he’s not paying attention to me while my dog is around. My boyfriend is the only person who seems to be so distracted by her to where he can’t focus on other things. 
I don’t think spending less time with her is the right option and I don’t think it has to do with where we are in our relationship. This week we spent two days without her, but again when she was around he couldn’t pay attention to anyone else. I had to take her out of the room and shut the door so he could do work. This type of behavior would bother me at any stage of our relationship, because I don’t think it’s healthy. And her not being around won’t stop the problem. We’ve talked about having children and my only doubt is that he won’t be able to discipline them. The fact that he carries my dog around like a baby, despite me saying giving her constant attention is not good for her, and him responding “but she’s so cute” does worry me. I have been around children all my life and know they require a lot of attention, but also know that you cannot give them all of the attention they demand because it’s not good for them if you cave every time they want attention. You have to tell them, “Mommy is talking right now, you will have to wait”. Maybe I shouldn’t completely equate the way he treats my dog to the way he would treat or children, but it does worry me that he can’t tell her no because “she’s so cute” and pays CONSTANT attention to her even when I have told him not to because it coddles her too much and told him that he's teaching her bad habits when he stops what he's doing to give her pets every time she asks.
I feel terrible for complaining that he is too loving to my dog… We are both 33 years old and this is a very serious relationship. I love him so much, he’s such a good man. Again, I love that he loves her. And I feel ridiculous to be jealous that he pays more attention to her than me. I am not a jealous, needy person and I hate complaining. But I feel like it represents more than just paying attention to the dog over me and other things. Am I the asshole for wanting him to be able to stop spoiling her and treat her more like a dog?

I leave her at home when I go to the gym everyday and when I go out with friends, but I am home during the days and my roommate is usually home in the evenings so she’s around people most of the time. Admittedly, she is needy and has separation anxiety and follows me around everywhere I go. But I still try to treat her like a dog. Despite her being needy, it hasn’t really affected any of my relationships.
My boyfriend is truly one of the best humans I know. He is sweet and kind and loyal and I am so thankful for him everyday. He’s an amazing person, but the only issue I have is that he treats my dog like a baby to the extent of ignoring me. I love that he loves her. But he literally carries her around like a baby, even though I’ve asked him not to and told him that it’s not good for her to give her constant attention because it makes her separation anxiety worse. It’s come to the point where he can’t even hold a conversation with me when she’s around. If his back is turned to her, he will constantly interrupt our conversation to turn and look at her and ask “what is the baby doing?” I will come into a room and he will be petting her instead of doing work. It’s like he can’t be in the same room as her without giving her attention. 
I never said anything to him or anyone else, because I felt like it was ridiculous to complain that he was paying too much attention to my dog. Again, he’s an incredible boyfriend and I do love that he loves her. 
But last night it all came out. We were sitting and cuddling and I was telling him how much I loved him, but he couldn’t even focus on me while I told him how much I love him. He kept turning to the dog to pet her. I got upset and told him that it hurt my feelings when he can’t even pay attention for me for a couple of minutes while I told him that I loved him and that it made me feel like I love him a lot more than he loves me. I’m not a super needy person and I don’t need constant assurance from my partner that they love me or constant attention, but it upset me that he can’t even take his eyes off of her for one minute. 
We talked about it, and he basically said that she is too distracting and we should spend less time with her until we build a stronger foundation because it gets in the middle of our relationship. But I don’t think the issue is spending time with her. I’ve had my dog for 6 years while with two other men (my boyfriend and I started dating this year) and it was never a problem. My dog was almost always around, but she didn’t get in between my exes and I spending quality time together. I know it’s not fair to compare exes, but she also hasn’t come in between my friendships. My roommate is close to my dog, but I never feel like he’s not paying attention to me while my dog is around. My boyfriend is the only person who seems to be so distracted by her to where he can’t focus on other things. 
I don’t think spending less time with her is the right option and I don’t think it has to do with where we are in our relationship. This week we spent two days without her, but again when she was around he couldn’t pay attention to anyone else. I had to take her out of the room and shut the door so he could do work. This type of behavior would bother me at any stage of our relationship, because I don’t think it’s healthy. And her not being around won’t stop the problem. We’ve talked about having children and my only doubt is that he won’t be able to discipline them. The fact that he carries my dog around like a baby, despite me saying giving her constant attention is not good for her, and him responding “but she’s so cute” does worry me. I have been around children all my life and know they require a lot of attention, but also know that you cannot give them all of the attention they demand because it’s not good for them if you cave every time they want attention. You have to tell them, “Mommy is talking right now, you will have to wait”. Maybe I shouldn’t completely equate the way he treats my dog to the way he would treat or children, but it does worry me that he can’t tell her no because “she’s so cute” and pays CONSTANT attention to her even when I have told him not to because it coddles her too much and told him that he's teaching her bad habits when he stops what he's doing to give her pets every time she asks.
I feel terrible for complaining that he is too loving to my dog… We are both 33 years old and this is a very serious relationship. I love him so much, he’s such a good man. Again, I love that he loves her. And I feel ridiculous to be jealous that he pays more attention to her than me. I am not a jealous, needy person and I hate complaining. But I feel like it represents more than just paying attention to the dog over me and other things. Am I the asshole for wanting him to be able to stop spoiling her and treat her more like a dog?

24,1gs2lyp,AITA for staying up too late playing video games with my best friend?,"So, my friend and I (whom I don't get to hang out with often) finally planned a guys day. My gf asked if she could come over later on, and that she ""won't bother us."" After asking multiple times, I finally caved and let her come over. 

She comes over smelling of alcohol and immediately starts playing the main character and takes over the conversation and runs the show.   
  
She took my friend outside to see her new car which is fine of course, but again, we just wanted to chill since we only get to once or twice a year.

As the night went on her behavior began to change for the worse, telling us that the video game we were playing is dumb, and that I needed to come to bed since it was 1am...etc. 

So, she finally walks away, and soon after the power goes off. I looked over at my friend confused and noticed some lights were still on so it didn't make sense.

But, then I figured it out...

**SHE TURNED OFF THE ELECTRICITY!**

On our guys night.

I walked to my bedroom and found her laying in my bed. I immediately told her how disrespectful that was and that him and I never get to hang out and she's overstepping her boundaries. 

She didn't care. She stood by her decision to turn off the electric and that it was late and I needed to come to bed with her. 

I told her that I would have NEVER done that to her and her friends. Finally my friend stepped in and told her off. They went back and forth and I eventually told her to leave. She refused.

My friend looked at my in the eyes and told me I need to get away from this girl.

I've afraid to move forward with her and she wants to move in together but I feel it would be miserable.

26,1gs1tg7,AITA for calling my (F31) mother selfish and unreasonable?,"disclaimer: I had no idea how to best formulate my question but prepare for a longish post.

My (F31) mother and I have always had a complex relationship. She's lived a hard life and my father went to work abroad when I was 7. From that time, my mother focused only on me and growing up, we had some spats and quarrels like all teens and mothers do.

My mother has a tendency to want to always be right. My whole teen-to-now life I've never worn anything without her wanting me to change into something she thought was better, I was required and expected to make zero decisions by myself and we used to have huge fights over what we'll into mu adulthood. A lot of trivial things like this have happened over this years and it's always bothered me about her. I think as a teen and in my early 20s, I felt smothered in a way but I never disrespected her.

3 years ago I met my current partner (M31) whom my mother hates. The reason why she hates him is this (she'd said it multiple times): since his father left and his mother was a wreck, he can't possibly be a good person and mean well.

She thinks that I will end up miserable like she is because i believe she cannot separate herself from my experiences.

My partner, however, is a great guy. We rent a flat together, both have jobs (and a cat), we had some bumps in the beginning but we've sorted them out and honestly I'm looking forward to spending my life with him

Fast forward to a month ago, my mom, who now suffers from Lyme disease and has had mental issues because of the illness, started attacking me regarding my relationship and mu life more frequently. Each fight escalated into her throwing me out and then begging me to come back and then gaslighted me into saying she never said or called me names that she indeed called me (such as being a constant liar, hating her, being manipulative, etc  etc. I have spoken to my therapist about it before and she's already told me I need to set boundaries with her as this is toxic behavior).

I have no clue why she thinks these things and why it is currently escalating. At one point, a few days ago, I was so exhausted from the stress (I myself am ill and am awaiting hospital check ups) I told her she was hurting me and acting selfishly. She got super mad and started shoving me away. She has these beliefs that I have been turned against her. She's even once called me a spoiled bitch (though this incident happend when she took too many anxiety meds that she was proscribed).

My BF and best friend think she's in the wrong and that I'm risking getting sick permanently because of the stress. I, on the other hand, am lost and devastated because I'm not sure if she could possibly have narcissistic tendencies (a word I don't like using carelessly) or if I am crazy?

She is at the moment angry at me and has called me twice to tell me she's miserable because of me. But I don't think I am wrong to be hurt by her words and actions.

Anyway, A had picked up a double and was understandably frustrated cause of a long day, that being said he was definitely taking it all out on everyone else, all night making comments to the guys on my line like “how does it take this fucking long for a side of noodles” which only makes their job worse cause now they have to with somebody yelling at them too. On one hand I see the frustration but on the other hand, we’re busy, the guys are slammed and my ticket times still aren’t even at 12 minutes. At the end of his shift one of the other servers was telling him what side work was his and he just lost it. He was being super rude, short and confrontational after that. Come to find out he didn’t do something right and another server asked “Hey A can you refill the ice for the morning crew?” And A started following the server around trying to argue with him and getting loud. Eventually I yelled at both of them to separate before I fire em both cause you could definitely hear them arguing from the lobby!

The situation progresses to A saying “I’m not doing my work what’s Mari (my wife) gunna do about it anyway, which is honestly where I get really fucking mad! Don’t go disrespecting my wife cause you’re not getting your way!

Anyway at the end of the night he pops in the office and says “hey I squashed the beef with the servers we good?” And my wife sent him home and told him he needed to cool off. Credit where credit is due he did call my wife and apologized to her, and being disrespectful on her shift. 

The next time he saw me he was super confrontational and just said “what you don’t wanna talk to me anymore?!” I just looked over in the line and told him “I don’t have the emotional bandwidth to deal with the fact that I’m essentially mad at you for throwing a fit and not owning up to it”

I haven’t spoken to him about anything that isn’t for work since, and I feel like an asshole for not trying to fix this cause he was my friend before all this happened, but I also feel like he shouldn’t just expect me to get over it! He was rude and disrespected, me, my line, my wife and our staff!

So AITA for not forgiving and forgetting? Or should he be trying to make it better?!

Edit: I’m more so mad at the fact that he apologized to my wife and foh but doesn’t feel the need to apologize to me or any of the guys on the line at all and expects us all to just be over it

If something’s bothering you in the restaurant please let us know so we can help you! And if you’re dealing with personal shit just tell me you need to get some air and I’ll watch your tables! But let’s please never let it get to that again, because you really upset my guys on the line and I felt disrespected by your comments and volume in my kitchen”

30,1gs1cmc,"AITA for being ""ungrateful?""","This was a while ago, but I still get upset when I think about it. I was 12F, I went to girl scouts, (about 6 girls) for a White elephant exchange, instead of getting a gift, opening it, and someone taking it or getting the next gift, we all got gifts and opened them, then traded. We didn't have a choice. Everyone had a 30-50 dollar gift. The host said the gifts should be about 20-30 bucks. Guess what the gift from the hosts daughter (that the host herself bought) was? A 2 dollar necklace and a 5 dollar gift card to crumbl cookie. (That place makes me really sick) So, sure I was upset, everyone got something I'd like and I got that. I didn't show it though and continued on. I asked EVERYONE if they'd trade. Everyone said no, so I give it to one of my friends.

32,1gs1b5x,AITA for telling my sister and boyfriend the inappropriate thing my BIL said to me?,"I (25F) live with my sister, Emily (27F), her husband Connor (25M), and their son Owen (1M) due to a variety of reasons, none of which are relevant to this story. The other night (11/13/24), my boyfriend Marcus (26M) came over to hang out and some athletic snuggling ensued. After Marcus had left, I heard the baby crying and ended up in the hallway with Emily and Connor after Owen was put back to sleep. Emily had asked if Marcus was still in my room, and I told her no, he had left. Connor then says ""Thank god, I could hear you downstairs with my noise cancelling headphones on!"" I was, reasonably, embarrassed that he had heard anything and even more so mortified that he had said that in front of my sister. I apologized and hoped that was the end of it.

As Emily goes back downstairs, Connor turns to me and says **""Don't be sorry, now I have something to think about the next time I masturbate.""** I tried to brush it off, as Connor often makes inappropriate remarks and I have always just ignored him in the past. I jokingly said ""Don't you mean you'll be thinking about Marcus?"" and he responded ""No, Marcus is too quiet, I didn't hear him. I only heard you."" Connor then goes back downstairs and I retreat to my bedroom. I couldn't stop thinking about what he'd said and how uncomfortable it made me, so I texted Marcus to ask him if I was overreacting.

Marcus was absolutely FURIOUS. He wanted me to tell Emily, but I was hesitant, as I didn't want to make Emily and Connor fight. I told him I would talk to her in the morning, hoping it would blow over and Marcus would forget about it, but he texted Emily. Emily then came into my room, and I started crying, saying that Connor's comment had bothered me but I didn't want to make it a big deal. Emily said that she would talk to Connor about it in the morning and make him apologize. I told her it didn't matter and it wasn't a big deal, but she insisted that he needed to apologize for it, especially since he has made inappropriate comments before and knows they make me uncomfortable.

The next day (11/14/24), I could tell something was tense between Emily and Connor, but I came home late, so I didn't interact with them much. Right before I went to bed, Emily asked me if Connor had apologized and I told her I hadn't even talked to him, so no. Today (11/15/24), I heard Connor and Emily arguing downstairs, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. Eventually, Connor storms upstairs and I hear him say, ""No, I'm not going to!

I knew Emily would be upset, but I didn't know Marcus would be so angry, and I didn't know it would cause this giant fight between Emily and Connor. AITA for saying anything at all?

34,1gs0r3z,AITA - Raising my 2yo brother,"AITA for moving out when my mom told me I should help raise my 2-year-old half-brother?

Hey Reddit, I’m (21F) and currently a junior in college, working part-time, and living at home to save on rent. My mom (42) is a single parent who ended up with a surprise baby a couple years ago. I don’t have any biological siblings myself, so this little guy is my first “sibling” experience.

Recently, my mom sat me down and said that with everything going on, she really needs “more hands on deck” with the baby. She asked if I could start taking on a lot more responsibilities with him, like picking him up from daycare, helping with meals, and basically being a live-in babysitter.

I told her that I already have a busy schedule with work and classes, and while I love my little brother, I’m not in a position to take on the role of a second parent. She seemed really hurt and said things like, “But family steps up for each other,” and that since I’m the only other “adult in the house,” it’s only fair I pull my weight.

After a lot of thought (and a little heartbreak), I decided to move out. I can afford a small apartment with a couple of roommates, but obviously, money is going to be a lot tighter now. When I told her, she got really upset, saying I was “abandoning” the family when they needed me and that I’m being selfish.

I’m torn because I feel bad about leaving my mom in a tough spot as she’s always worked so hard to provide me the most, but I also feel like I didn’t sign up to be a co-parent and staying at home will really hinder my future.

39,1gryldw,AITA for letting my roommate know that I feel obligated to care for his dog?,"TLDR; AITA for feeling obligated to do my roommate's dog chores, and trying to set a boundary about it?

My roommate, (G), moved in with me, (P), a few months ago, and brought his golden retriever. I am fine with this arrangement. I love dogs, and my roommate and I get along on all fronts.

The dog sleeps in a crate each night, which I do not have a problem with, and usually is put in at 8-9pm.

Consistently, I wake up earlier than G does, and when I wake up, 7-8am, I find it rude to not take the dog out to at least pee. He's been waiting for 10-12hrs to pee. And I find it sad if I put him back in the crate right after, because he needs to stretch his legs.

So daily, I feel an obligation to care for this dog's social needs in the morning if I'm the first one he sees. Filling up the water bowl. Feeding. Throwing a ball. Petting. Which usually amounts to about 1hr or less of time outside the crate before I have to leave for work.

My roommate has been more frequently emerging from his room after I have done all of these dog chores. And immediately leaving for work. Once a week, he will wake up earlier than me and take the dog for a long walk, (\~20mins).

This morning, G and I exchanged good mornings, and I said I wanted to bring something to his attention...so I said ""I fear I may be starting to feel resentment about doing doggy chores in the morning, or feel like there's a mild expectation that I take care of these things because I see him first in the morning before you do.""

The vibe got defensive from him. I might not have been worded the best. I just needed to say something because I don't want this to bubble into a larger issue.

He said ""what, do you want me to get up earlier or something? You don't have to do these things. He doesn't need to be taken out for a walk in the mornings, that's just something I do if I feel like it.""

I said ""I am starting to feel bad, it's taking a toll on me, it feels like a burden to wake up earlier than you do, I don't want to just ignore the dog, he needs to go out. I didn't take him out to poop this morning either because I need to leave soon.""

He got quiet and said ""yeah, that's fine. Don't do these things if you don't want to. He's fine. I have a meeting. Got to go."" Then he left for work.

TLDR; AITA for feeling obligated to do my roommate's dog chores, and trying to set a boundary about it?

My roommate, (G), moved in with me, (P), a few months ago, and brought his golden retriever. I am fine with this arrangement. I love dogs, and my roommate and I get along on all fronts.

The dog sleeps in a crate each night, which I do not have a problem with, and usually is put in at 8-9pm.

Consistently, I wake up earlier than G does, and when I wake up, 7-8am, I find it rude to not take the dog out to at least pee. He's been waiting for 10-12hrs to pee. And I find it sad if I put him back in the crate right after, because he needs to stretch his legs.

So daily, I feel an obligation to care for this dog's social needs in the morning if I'm the first one he sees. Filling up the water bowl. Feeding. Throwing a ball. Petting. Which usually amounts to about 1hr or less of time outside the crate before I have to leave for work. Sometimes, I am even late to work, because I have my own morning routine (getting dressed, breakfast).

He was vegetarian when we met and I have always respected it and he has always not been bothered by me eating meat. At home I have always eaten vegetarian since we cohabited, out of convenience for eating together.

When we had a child (now 4) we decided to raise him vegetarian. It is a strong belief of my husband, a neutral thing for me. I wanted to respect his beliefs. I do the cooking and cook vegetarian food for our son.

My son is v. smart and began to pick up whether I was vegetarian or not from 2 and a half onwards - this was developmentally earlier than I was expecting. Arguably, I didn't deal with it the best way initially. I told my son I would go vegetarian after he said things like ""I want you to be vegetarian and kind to animals, mummy"". This reasoning of his came from me - I have always tried to enhance my husband's views in my son by explaining were raising hom vegetarian as it's important to be kind to animals. He conceptually understands death, from living in the countryside and knows that you eat dead animals if having meat. This is where this comment of his came from. 

However, after telling my son I was vegetarian I still ate meat when not around him. Now to the AITA bit... I have, on occasion, snuck some meat into my order when eating out with him. For example, having a sosauges sandwich and saying it was veggie sausages. I know it's wrong to lie to kids, but I thought of it as a white lie. I kicked the can down the road to deal with all this when he's older.

Today I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich and the waitress announced it on delivery. My son picked up on this and, not upset too much, but told me I'd done bad behaviour. My husband was there and has told me he's furious at me. Not because of not being vegetarian, but because I lied to our son and then tried to sneak a bit of meat at lunch time.

42,1grycau,AITA for not coming home during the day to let my (23F) boyfriend’s (26M) dog out while I’m trying to finish my thesis?,"My boyfriend of 3.5 total years and I have been living together for 1.5 years now in an apartment with one other roommate. My boyfriend got the dog (5M) around the time we met, and I love him. I take care of the dog every morning because my boyfriend doesn’t wake up early enough, but we both leave for the day around 7:30 a.m.

I’m in my third semester of my master’s program, and my advisor expects a first draft of my thesis in three weeks so I can graduate on time in May. I work best in my office, where I have a second monitor and space to spread out research materials. I also have ADHD and take medication, so I'm most productive in long, uninterrupted blocks of time before evening hours.

Previously, I could stay home late or come home early from school to help with the dog. My boyfriend's old job was only 15 minutes away from the apartment, so he could come home for lunch, and sometimes our roommate let the dog out at 3 p.m. Since October, my boyfriend started a new job 30 minutes away, and I'm now pulling 12-hour days with classes, teaching, grading, and my thesis.

This has led to arguments about the dog’s care. For example, today (Friday), I planned to work on my thesis all day in my office since I have no meetings, labs, or classes. However, as I was leaving, my boyfriend told me that I needed to at least come home once during the day to let the dog out. I reminded him that it takes me 30 minutes to commute each way (15-20 minutes of walking to my car + 10 minute drive) and that I work best with uninterrupted blocks of time. He accused me of deliberately avoiding responsibility and said I should help because I had no other obligations. I told him that I am happy to take care of the dog when I can, but that he shouldn't expect me to take care of him more than I actually can.

I already take the dog out every morning at around 7:15 a.m., but that leaves a long gap until our roommate comes home at 3 p.m. While I feel bad about that, I cannot afford delays in my thesis timeline. If I do not graduate on time, we'll have to renew our lease and might end up paying for two leases if I can't find a job in this city (I’ve been searching for months, and there aren’t many options in my field here).

I've talked to him about paying for a dog walker or paying our roommate to take him out every day, but he is strongly against those ideas, although he just got a raise. I think he sees this as a test of my commitment to the relationship, though we've both said we want to get married.

The icing on the cake is that I've always wanted a cat, and my plan was always to get one after I graduated. However, he said that I can't get one. He expects me to take time out of my studies to take care of his dog but yet won't let me get my own furry friend.

I feel maybe they bought the cake out of norms and thinking I may get hurt.Adding to that I'm not at all happy or satisfied with my current life. There is only a deep sadness. 
I want to cut the cake for them at least to make them happy and hide my actual feelings as i used to do every year. But this time I couldn't mask my emotions. I didn't break down in front of them but I just didn't feel like cutting it. 

I appreciate the arrangements out of love, but i just felt it so artificial.

Did I behave wrong? Have i created an unnecessary scene/drama which they don't even care but I care?

lately,she began going on a regular check ups,screenings,etc,and at first,was only acting delusional that she has something new going on,but the doctors and screening results would shut her up for a while. but lately,she started doing things to provoke her illnesses - refuses to take her meds,doesn't eat at all for the entire day just so she'd faint,and does things to provoke tachycardia. and because of such episodes,she actually convinced herself that she's very bad right now and is actively terrorizing all of us - my brother and i,my aunt,and grandma. yelling at us,guilt tripping us,and lying about her conditions.
what she didn't know is that,since i work in the healthcare industry,i can see all her screening results,outcomes of doctors appointments etc and i confronted her about them when she tried lying to me that she had another stroke and tried extracting money from my brother and me. her health didn't change from 2020,and she's trying to gaslight me into believing her.

so i got really upset,as i was her primary caregiver since i was a child - helping her with her epilepsy attacks,going with her to her chemotherapy appointments,when she had a stroke i helped her by taking her to the physiotherapy clinic and even did all the exercises with her at home. i yelled at her for being so full of herself to even think that acting out will make us stop whatever we're doing and bow down to her so we can be her servants.

now she's exploding on my brother and aunt and my aunt is crying because she can't handle so much stress. so.. aita?

However, the issue is that both of us are Indian (we live in boston) and our family members back home will require visas. S’s family is slightly more well off than mine and will be able to afford the traveling costs. However, my mom’s side of the family (some people might remember my old post about my aunt asking my brother and I to pay her daughter’s tuition) is struggling financially and even if they can manage to travel, getting a visa will be hard for them as Schengen visas are hard to get for Indians, let alone those with low income. They’re saying that they cannot afford the tickets but they want to attend my wedding, so they want me to change my venue to somewhere within India. My parents are telling me I need to stop being selfish and my family has a right to be there to see me get married, which I agree with, but I really do not want to change my venue, afterall it’s been my dream since forever!

But even despite that, they’re saying that since my grandmother is pretty old and gets sick while traveling (even by car to distant places) and they want me to keep it within the state they live in (it’s a very boring state and I won’t get the kind of wedding I want there). S is siding with my family and says we could always just have the wedding in the state, but his parents disagree with him and are saying that since it’s our wedding, it should be our choice.

56,1grsju2,WIBTA for not going to an event?,"This requires some background information. (For reference, this happened when we were around 19 or 20)

A few years ago, something happened between myself and two people I went to high school with (now 22M, who I'll call Owen, and 22F, who I'll call Sophie - for the sake of anonymity).

A year or two after we all finished high school, Owen, who I was good friends with, started dating Sophie. I did not know at the time, and later found out that he purposefully did not tell me. From what I've gathered from mutual friends, he told them not to tell me either. This is important.

I had feelings for Owen (awful teenage drama, I know. honestly, it was more proximity attraction than anything else), and I confessed, which was when I was eventually told that the two were together (around four or five months after they'd made it official)

The two had issues in their relationship, and I was told things (later, I found out these were all lies, and ironically enough, he was lying to her as well - about me and other things)

We grew to dislike one another, and I cut my losses and blocked both of them. The two broke up after about a year, and six months after they broke up, Owen and I reconnected. Once again, things ended badly, and I cut off several people in the aftermath. We haven't spoken since, and I do not plan to either.

The issue now comes with regards to Sophie. We have mutual friends, and while I don't particularly care, I know she does not like me. At the end of the month, there will be an event one of my friends is hosting, and I recently found out Sophie would be there. While I am able to ignore and/or play nice, I'm concerned about souring the mood or ruining the event for others.

Would I be wrong not to go? For the sake of keeping peace, I am considering it, but I do not want to have to cancel every time an event is held just to keep the peace amongst our mutual friends.

I just want to know if I'd be wrong in going, knowing it will most likely stir the pot, or at the very least, contribute to petty gossip.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-15,"WIBTA for not going to an event? This requires some background information. (For reference, this happened when we were around 19 or 20)

A few years ago, something happened between myself and two people I went to high school with (now 22M, who I'll call Owen, and 22F, who I'll call Sophie - for the sake of anonymity).

A year or two after we all finished high school, Owen, who I was good friends with, started dating Sophie. I did not know at the time, and later found out that he purposefully did not tell me. From what I've gathered from mutual friends, he told them not to tell me either. This is important.

I had feelings for Owen (awful teenage drama, I know. honestly, it was more proximity attraction than anything else), and I confessed, which was when I was eventually told that the two were together (around four or five months after they'd made it official)

The two had issues in their relationship, and I was told things (later, I found out these were all lies, and ironically enough, he was lying to her as well - about me and other things)

We grew to dislike one another, and I cut my losses and blocked both of them. The two broke up after about a year, and six months after they broke up, Owen and I reconnected. Once again, things ended badly, and I cut off several people in the aftermath. We haven't spoken since, and I do not plan to either.

The issue now comes with regards to Sophie. We have mutual friends, and while I don't particularly care, I know she does not like me. At the end of the month, there will be an event one of my friends is hosting, and I recently found out Sophie would be there. While I am able to ignore and/or play nice, I'm concerned about souring the mood or ruining the event for others.

57,1grsfvk,AITA For not paying my friend extra for getting me discounted meat ,"For a bit of background, my friend works as a butcher at Whole Foods, so he’s able to get meats at a reduced price. He has a flat 20% discount on everything, but sometimes he can also mark expensive cuts as ground beef, which allows him to get it for a lot cheaper. He offered to buy some meat for me with his discount, and I’ve started taking him up on his offer. Tonight, when he sent me the receipt, it showed a total price of $29.10, of which $9 was for chicken he bought for himself. After which the following conversation accrued and I don’t feel good about it. he’s a good friend I just think he’s a little clueless as to what he’s doing.


Friend:
I got flank steak this time.
Similar to skirt.
Habaenro blend you might want to more evenly spread it again.
So
2.2 lbs steak x 18 = 40$
2.5 lbs chicken x 8 = 20$
I’ll give it to you 40$

Thighs are bone in skin on today
This is non discounted price

Me:
You got chicken for yourself?

Friend:
Yeah the smaller one is for me

Me:
I’ll pay your bill
So your chicken’s on me

Friend:
That’s 20$ of meat I saved you there

Me:
Thank you 😊
1 friend

Friend:
With 40$
Down from 60
You get 20$ in saving I get 18

Me:
You’re asking me to pay for 40 for what you paid 20?

Friend:
You said extra for ground beef price

Me:
20+9 is extra…

Friend:
It would’ve cost 48$ for me without ground beef pricing.
We should’ve established a rule if I did get ground beef prices.
29$ will work for this time.

Me:
Sure we can make an agreement

Friend:
How about
So retail price.
You’ll always be able to get the 20% discount
If I do anything above that.
For every dollar I save you pay me 50c more.
So like
Let’s say I got something for 50% of retail
You’d pay no tax on the 20% discount but a 50% tax on the other part.
Square deal!

Me:
Counter offer: tip = ((retail x 0.8) - actual) x 0.3
30% of the difference between discount retail price and final price.
I’m really not willing to do anything else.

Friend:
50-50.
How is 50-50 not fair.
40-60.
Compromise.
Lowballing me I see.

Me:
It’s fair in terms of emotionless capitalism.
Unfair in that you’re trying to squeeze money out of a friend.

Friend:
One could say the same of you

Me:
Not really.
The difference is I’m not profiting.
And I’m actually putting money in your pocket
Because I appreciate what you’re doing for me.

Friend:
I’m saving you at least 20%.
That’s money in your pocket.

Me:
If this is going to be a whole thing, I’ll stop asking.

Friend:
It’s up to you.
Chicken gold egg

Me:
Nah bro.
I really thought you were doing this in a “let me help a friend out” kinda way and not a “let’s make some money on the side” kinda thing.
I’ve rarely ever asked you for gas or parking money despite driving 99% of the time we hang out.
I’ve paid for your food a number of times without the expectation I would ever get that money back.
Unless there’s something I’m missing here, I actually find what you’re asking for quite insulting.
I also don’t appreciate you trying to pressure me after I gave you a very clear boundary.

Friend:
You were the one who suggested the extra if ground beef prices idea.

Me:
Correct.
That’s called generosity and appreciation
This is greed

20% discount easy.

I am in a 5 year rel with my bf and we are planning to get married next year. Earlier this year, there was a girl who got so clingy with him. I told him that I am uncomfortable coz the girl keeps calling her late at night or even around 2 -4 am. Plus, the girl who lives 8 hrs away from us would asked them if he could say in bf's house whenever she'd visit the city.

Despite of being uncomfortable with her, I still treat the girl nicely (she knows that I do not like her), and I won't even say anything bad about her. Others notice the girl's unusual behavior and they started to wonder why she kept going to their house when she has other ""close"" friends in the city.

62,1grrlfw,AITA for telling my mom my family won’t be coming home for Thanksgiving this year,"I (F24) moved in with my fiancé (F26) in June. Before this move, I have always lived in my hometown, where my parents live.  We now live 2 hours away.

Before I moved with in with my partner, my daughter (F5) and I have always spent holidays with my parents. My partner would drive up when she could, depending on her work schedule and the road conditions. This year my partner and I decided to stay home for Thanksgiving for a multitude of reasons. 

The first of which is because we want to begin our own traditions as a family in our first home together. The second of which is because of my partner’s work schedule. She will be working everyday from November 25th - December 7th, with the exception of Thanksgiving day. I am also making her staff a full meal to bring in on Black Friday and will need time to prep.

The third reason is that I have reached a point in my life where I believe I should not do whatever I am told by my mother and do what I want. It was very difficult for me to come out to my parents and almost harder to move away from them. My parents were abusive, kicked me out as a minor, and I spent many holidays homeless and alone. Once we reconnected, I have done everything to make sure they don’t discard me again. My mother has never apologized for anything she has done to me. 

I have never made plans on holidays because I know they want me there, however they never check if I do have plans in the first place.

Tonight (11/14) I, my mother, and my daughter were on a FaceTime call just catching up. My mother said she would see us in a couple of weeks for Thanksgiving. I told her that we were not coming and she was shocked. I told her that my fiancé had to work and that I was making food for her staff the next day and with the road conditions, it seemed like a lot. She was immediately upset and said she bought things for my daughter and that if we weren’t going to come to her, she was going to come to us with my father. She began bawling and hung up the call with me. She then yelled at my father saying it was his fault we were not coming and he must have done something to upset us. She also asked my sister if she upset me. I began receiving calls from each family member asking if I was mad at them or what had happened.

 At this point I was bawling my eyes out as I had never really set boundaries before with my mother and I did feel guilty. My fiancé and I talked about it and decided to cave in because I could not handle the stress. 

I called my mom to apologize and she did not answer my call. I then sent her a long text, where I apologized profusely multiple times, explained that I was not upset with anyone, and that if they would still have us, we would love to go. It has been 6 hours and she has not responded to my text. 

I do understand I should have let her know about this sooner, It was very difficult for me to tell her which also led to me avoiding the topic until she brought it up. Am I the asshole?

They are these little plush keychains with. vinyl face, and they come in blind boxes so you don’t know which one you are going to get. However Pop Mart barely rereleases their items, once in a while they drop them again by surprise but they sell out pretty quickly. I was lucky enough to find a full box set of all six of the characters from the Have A Seat set. Also it was a treat for myself since I haven’t collected dolls since I was a kid. 

(This next part you might want to Google Labubu: Have A Seat to visualize what they look like, since I’m not allowed to post pictures on this subreddit) 

The three dolls I really wanted from that set and couldn’t stop talking about when I was with my family were Dada (the pink one with heart eyes), QuQu (the mint green one with eyelashes), and Zizi (the purple one with the sleepy eyes). 

I have a little brother in middle school who said that he’ll take HeHe (grey one with the scrunched up eyes) cause he’s not too big on Labubus, nor did he who what they are but he was curious about it. I also didn’t care for giving HeHe away, since I wasn’t too crazy about them, but then when I opened all of them and he saw QuQu he told me he wanted it. I established my boundaries saying that we already talked about it and I said I would get QuQu, Dada, and Zizi, while he would get HeHe. 

Then my mom came in and told me to give QuQu to him. I tried to establish my boundaries again telling her that I have been looking forward to having those three, but she still kept insisting that I give my brother the green one so he “has a nice toy too” and if I didn’t want to give her up I would have to sacrifice either Dada or Zizi. I tried to get my brother to take Baba (the light brown one with big brown eyes) instead, but my brother said: “No, she’s ugly and you already have all the pretty ones.” 

So just to shut them up, I gave up the green Labubu, but I was still kind of upset about it over dinner causing my family to go on a tangent about how I’m “selfish” and a “spoiled brat.” My mom asking: “Why are you so greedy?” Then my dad then decided to randomly vent his built up frustration he had towards me because my job and internship hours interfere with my brother’s extracurricular activities, saying: “You always think the world revolves around you!”

I feel kind of stupid for getting upset over this, cause it’s just a hunk of cotton and plastic. I didn’t know why I was getting so emotional over a stupid doll, but I don’t think it’s really about the doll, it was about my boundaries not being respected.

64,1grqqu5,AITA for not explaining to my partner why I'm not in a good mood? ,"I've been having a fairly downer past month. Not insanely bad, but just a lot of small things building up and just draining all my energy. 

Now, here's the thing. I've generally managed to keep a strong face through all of it and been able to stay optimistic about things and generally was able to, if nothing else, come off as fairly upbeat. 

Now, the past few weeks, not often, but there are times where the day just felt especially shitty that I'd rant about something to my GF and she'd just kinda blow me off. First time, I did it in-person, but she got upset with me for it, saying 'I was complaining about a non issue' and, what irked me the most was she said 'boo fucking hoo poor you'. I'm fine with being criticized. Hell, I'm even fine with being criticized about things I'm complaining about. I always felt it was healthy to be able take that criticism to look deeper on how I feel about something. But, the one thing I have said time and time and time again, both to her, in the presence of her, and explained to her, is I absolutely hate being blown off— I hate being told my opinion or feeling are invalid. 

The same shit happened a lot from my uncle whenever he'd get into religious tirades and tried to claim he knew better and my perspective mattered not since he had more world experience, friends blew off anything I'd say about events, media, etc. if I wasn't as experienced in it than they are, but to have that come from my partner who I've probably explained this to a dozen times at this point— felt genuinely painful. 

And that was kinda a turning point. It wasn't a completely downhill drop, but my mood just kept diminishing day by day. I ended up venting another two times over messages while I was out and... just nothing. Not a reply. I know she sees it. Just doesn't respond. Then, the next time we meet up, she talks like it never happened. 

 Again, I wanna be clear— I don't have some kind of terrible life. Just a pretty average life. But just a lot of small things have been building up constantly and, mix that with a diagnosed depressive order, as well as not being able to afford anti-depressants anymore, I'm completely at the end of my line and just in a state of existing. 

The thing is, my girlfriend noticed this— and, when she asked why I was feeling and talking the way I did, I just said 'just kinda happened. No reason'. 

That being said, I don't really wanna tell her about those things for two primary reasons: 
1. I don't want her blaming herself for my mood being crap. Yeah, it was admittedly part of it, but it's also a lot of other things that don't have her to do with it. 

2. Maybe, worse for how I look, I just feel like it's a lost cause. I've almost given up on trying to explain that the way she ignores my venting hurts me a lot. I only say almost because I'm still thinking about it— why I'm making a post here. ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-15,"AITA for not explaining to my partner why I'm not in a good mood?

65,1grqojv,WIBTA If I Don't Stay With An Ex/Toxic Friend For Prom,"Firstly, I'm going to give some background. I, (17 F) and S (for privacy purposes) (17 F) used to be really close best friends for multiple years.

 Though for a while we have been getting distant, but we still remained cordial and at that time we decided to book essentially the same room to stay in after prom (I know this is different than actual prom, but in the area I live in, proms happen in hotels, so you have the option of booking a room to stay overnight). However, after agreeing to book the rooms together, during class w this friend she decided to tell me via a note that she didn't want to be close friends w me any more and wanted to be just friends.

 This reveal of her wanting to just be friends with me was genuinely hurtful and insulting and since that day I haven't been able to look at her the same. All of the wrongs she did throughout our friendship feels amplified and I don't even want to acquaintances with her anymore. I even apologized to her for this and in turn she used her victim complex to the fullest and wrote to me about how angry she felt that I was abandoning our friendship.
 
Because the payments were made I thought I couldn't get out of this, but, luckily for me there were problems with the booking and everyone is getting a full refund. So I have the option to not stay with her, but instead stay with another friend.

 This change will be last minute and I am not sure if my ex best friend and the other people I was going to stay with and afford booking a 3 person room. 

 So, would I be the asshole if I changed rooms and didn't stay with an ex friend for prom?

66,1grqk3o,AITA for (potentially calling out my roommate's bad dishwashing?,"Okay so my roommate and I share dishes (our landlord has all of them for their tenants, really nice actually). She doesn't use dishes as often as I do, which I don't know, is because of our different eating habits I guess? But I try to wash dishes as often as I can. I'm not perfect, there are times when I leave them for days at a time, but considering she doesn't use as many as I do, I observe that even though it's been days, the dishes that are clean are enough for her (and honestly if my habits were a problem, I'd hope she'd complain to me). There are many times that when she uses a plate, and I've seen this with my own eyes; she takes the sponge with NO soap and just gently ""scrubs"" (if you can even call it that) the plate and then puts it on the drying rack. And yes, she sometimes leaves dried pieces of food or whatever. I came home and she made some box mac and cheese (I know this because we buy our groceries together, I know she eats this) and there's dry pieces of cheese sauce on the pot she used to cook it with, and on the ladle. This isn't the first time she's done this, and lots of times I just quickly wash it without complaining. But she left TWO FUCKING THINGS dirty, and I believe she might've left even the bowl she used dirty (I didn't look that closely though, could be wrong). I don't find her habit of just sloshing the wet sponge with no fucking soap hygienic, and I'm even a bit offended that she's okay with me using dishes she ""washed"" that way. Am I the asshole if I call her out, and even suggest better dishwashing habits?? Like also squeezing out the excess water from the fucking sponge?

He knew this was coming and he set his affairs when he still had a sound mind. He gave me power of attorney and he made me the executor of his estate. The state laws here and the terms of my dad's power of attorney document gives me the power to sell or transfer anything. Effectively, I'm in complete and total control of his estate. I'm the youngest of four (two older brothers and a sister) and there is a large age gap between me and my three  siblings. I'm 18 years younger than my sister who is the next youngest.

When my dad told all of us about his estate planning decisions, I could tell my siblings were really apprehensive about how much power my dad gave me but I told them everything from that point our dad's estate would effectively be frozen. I'll find management companies to take care of his properties and the money will go back into the estate for his care. I'm not selling anything, I'm not buying anything, and I'm going to follow our dad's wishes to the letter. When our dad passes, we'll divide up the estate according to his will.

Sorry not sorry but if it’s gonna be a sport or travel or anything expensive make sure you know they like the sport or know they have good terms with other people. Also game is in a few or couple months and the tickets were like 80 to 300 each idk each website had different websites with same seatings or similar. I even offered to pay back or help them sell the ticket but it will make them “uncomfortable” 
AITA? 
Also I tried from their POV and I can’t see it cause P and reasons I said in past texts ",1.0,0.9550556,1,1
70,1grpul4,WIBTA if I told my MIL she's jealous of her daughter?,"My fiancé, let's call her Ella (21F), and I (20F) have been together for 2 1/2 yrs, and living together for 1. We kept our relationship to ourselves because Ella wasn't out to her family. (This is important later). A month ago Ella got a text from her mom (41F) inviting us to a 'cookout' at her new boyfriend's house which is about a 1 1/2 hr drive from us. In the past, we have met her boyfriend a few times, but we were a little hesitant. This is also not a long-term relationship (probably around 3-4 months) and quoting Ella: ""It will not be her last due to her history"". We ended up going and when we got there we got this laundry list of things we needed to do from her mom, let's call her Martha (because we will be talking about her a lot). This was not so we could help move furniture and decorate someone else's house for Halloween that we barely knew. I could tell that Ella was getting annoyed throughout the day but everything started when Martha, Ella, and I were all putting together some furniture.

As we were putting the furniture together, I felt like it was a little too quiet throughout the house so I went to go check on the kids, (4, 6, and 10 yo). I was gone for about 20ish minutes, but when I came back I could tell something was wrong. Ella seemed completely distraught and I knew that something had happened. The rest of the night was very awkward and Martha kept giving me weird looks and bad vibes. When we went to leave, we drove a little down the road until Ella pulled over and completely broke down. When I asked what was wrong she said her mom was completely against the idea of us being together. Ella said the conversation started because Martha had asked if we were living together ""as friends, or more than friends"" Ella then responded with, ""how would you feel if it was more than friends?"" which caused Martha to blow up at her saying things such as, does she (being me) even have a plan for her life, are you just going to follow her. Blah Blah. To sum it up, Martha believes that if we were to move in together, we would invite gay men over to get pregnant. A couple of days later I told Ella that her mom is a homophobe based on the conversations I had overheard and been told about in the past and that I wanted to talk to her about this. I want to tell Martha that this is not a way to treat her daughter and that she needs to grow up and stop being jealous of Ella just because Martha ruined her 20s by getting pregnant with her at 19. (Context: For the last 4 years, all Martha has asked or pushed Ella about is getting a boyfriend, to quote: ""You need to put yourself out there, find yourself a nice boy to settle down and move in with"". Almost every single conversation until now when I just happen to be another woman) Ella wasn't entirely opposed to the idea but we've talked about the situation to some close friends and they told me that ITA if I were to go off on Martha. So, WIBTA?

EDIT: I just want to clarify because I don’t think I explained it well, but I would not just call her out the blue. This would be a situation if she were to start something towards Ella.

71,1grosxh,AITA for not reaching out to my family and refusing their demands?,"I grew up in a ""closed"" extended family. We were pretty close with my aunts/uncles/cousins, often living together with one family unit in a single room (around 15 people in the house), however we didn't have much contact with non-family members. As kids, we weren't allowed to have friends. We were allowed to go to school, but had to come back home when it ended. No hanging out with classmates and no after school activities. For me, personally, being the youngest one, I was usually an afterthought, even for my parents. Needless to say, I was suffering from depression.

I moved out of the house when I went to college, and started exploring my freedom. However, even then, I was expected to call everyday and come back home every weekend. As time went on, I started to distance myself by skipping phone calls and not going back every weekend. Eventually. I broke off all contact with my family.

A  year after graduating, I had a pretty stable life for myself and I thought to get back in touch with at least my parents and siblings. The first few conversations (over phone) were just them yelling at me, and I endured it. After months of this, we were finally able to have some conversation. And every time, I was the one who called. When I finally visited back home there was more yelling and they expected me to move back into the house. I refused their demand, which lead to more yelling again. This continued for a few more months without any progress. So, I started to distance myself again. That was over a decade ago.

Last year, I started to get phone calls from several family members. However, every single call follows the same routine; first they try to make me feel guilty about breaking contact and not calling or visiting (I just hang up if they start yelling), and then they want something from me. Usually they want money or have some of my cousins move in with me. My response to that is always no.

So, am I the asshole?

72,1gro8z5,AITA for wanting my sibling to share their happiness with me? ,"I (23F) have an elder sibling whom I’ve always been very close to. We grew up in a functional family, and I was always taught to treat my sibling with the same level of respect and love I would give my parents. I shared everything with them, no matter how embarrassing or how much trouble I might get into, if my sibling told my parents. I never kept anything from my parents or my siblings though—I’ve always been pretty open and emotional.

Recently, my sibling got married, and everything changed. They stopped sharing things, which I understood; they were married and had their own private world. But then I started feeling like their spouse was deliberately trying to distance me from them, almost like I was a nuisance whenever I visited their house. It felt like my sibling was paying less and less attention to me, and I could sense that the spouse was influencing this. At first, I blamed myself. I thought, ""What kind of sister feels jealous of her sibling’s spouse?"" I kept telling myself that I was just being negative or overreacting. I did try to briefly talk to my sibling about how I felt, but she didn’t seem to take it seriously.

Today, my mom told me that my sibling is expecting a baby. This news hit me hard, not because I’m not happy for them, but because it felt like my sibling had deliberately excluded me from sharing in this joy. Everyone on the spouse’s side knows, but I had no idea. My sibling didn’t even think to let me in on this huge part of their life.

I’ve always imagined that my sibling’s children would feel like my own—like we would be a close family, and I would be involved in their lives. But now, I feel like I’m being pushed out. It feels like I’ll become an outsider, like the bond we once had is slipping away. This baby will grow up with the spouse’s family as the primary support, and I’m afraid I’ll be left out of it all. This baby will be the last straw. And I will somehow feel resentful towards this baby. But that would be wrong.

To make matters worse, I’m not in a great place mentally, and my family doesn’t really know what I’m going through. So, part of me wonders if I’m just overreacting or reading too much into this situation. But if I’m not overreacting, how do I deal with this? How do I handle feeling so left out and disconnected from someone I used to be so close to?

  
Edit: After seeing the comments, I realized that saying, ""I’ve always imagined that my sibling’s children would feel like my own,"" comes across as a bit creepy. I apologize; English is not my first language. What I meant to convey is that I want to be close to my niblings so that they can depend on me for support, similar to how I would support my own children. I didn’t intend to imply that I want to be involved in every decision they make; I'm not interested in that since they have their parents for guidance. I had a great relationship with my father’s brothers; they were really cool and provided me with a lot of support. My father was never concerned about this because they always respected boundaries. I hope what I'm saying makes sense. And with my sibling, if something happens, I also thought it would be us against the world, I never thought marriage could change that. 

These are my feelings, but I never really thought about whether my sibling was okay with this; I just assumed we understood each other. I always believed that sharing everything about your day shows trust and love, but maybe I was wrong about that. I'm afraid to talk to them because I think it will be a serious conversation, and I don't want to ruin their happiness or take away any attention from what's important now, the baby.

73,1grnmcy,WIBTA if I told my bff to grow up and move on already…,"My (30F) best friend (29F) has never had a serious relationship in her entire life until earlier this year. We have been friends since grade school and sadly drifted apart when she went to grad school in South Carolina (we lived in MA) and I stayed in our city. During those years apart I found my current partner (33M) and couldn’t wait for my BFF to meet him. After she had graduated she chose to practice in the south for one more year before she moved back up home. For context, not a lot of our friends stayed in our city so I had made new friends. This is where it’s become difficult. Since she has returned she’s always insisting on going out to bars & clubs to find men and will say that I’m the perfect wing woman since I’m taken. I’ve always been super uncomfortable with this because I don’t want to disrespect my partner or our relationship SO I’ve been able to get out of a couple of those crazy nights and just settle for 1v1 dinners during the work week. Thus, my partner hasn’t been too thrilled with her existence since she’s returned. 
I had some coworkers host a St.Patty’s Day party at a local bar and since my partner was working I brought my bff. From the moment we walk in she clings onto an intern (25M) and they’re basically all over each other for the entire night, which clearly caused some work drama for me but oh well.

76,1grmdk8,AITAH for avoiding my childhood friend and best friend ,"So I (17 F) am struggling in what to do. I am apart of a friend group that all like and respect each other, we never cross each other’s boundaries and are always with each other. Our friend group is really large and has a very diverse set or personalities. My childhood friend (17 M), who I have known for roughly 12-13 years and my best friend (17 F) who I have known for 5-6, have started hanging out more often, I ofc didn’t think much of it as we are all friends and hang out separately from time to time. 2 weeks into the last term of the year I started hanging out and reconnecting with my middle school friends as I hadn’t spoken to them in a while, I’d spend every other break and/or class with them and just talk. 

From this I had learned that my childhood friend had been bad mouthing me, saying I had “ruined a 12 year friendship” and that I was “distancing myself from the group”. For context a couple weeks prior, I had gotten a bit upset at him because he was making inappropriate comments to our other friend (16 F) regarding some older (18-19) boys. She had decided she didn’t wanna deal with it and stopped being friends with him, from there he kept bringing it up even though he was told by teachers and others to not bring it up. She had asked me for advice and I had taken her to a well-being staff and she talked about it with me next to her. From this she told me he later apologised and that it was sorted out. To which I left it alone and didn’t bring it up. 

According to several people (not apart of the original group) had heard him constantly mention the whole situation and say that I was “acting this way” because of it and that he was badmouthing me. After finding this out I went to my next class with my best friend and had talked to her about it, as I was upset and would usually talk to her about things like that. From this I later texted her that night apologising since they were friends and she had said before she didn’t wanna be apart of “drama”. She had given me a really weird reply (in my and others opinion) saying she didn’t wanna be apart of drama and she didn’t like people talking bad about friends as she feels likes she betraying them and just thanked me for apologising. I had left it at that and went to school the next day, where I had emailed my year levels well-being leader to talk to her about the whole situation as I didn’t know what to do. At this point the only person that I had spoken to about this situation was my best friend and my mother (and the people who had told me about him badmouthing me, but they don’t really talk to him unless he starts the conversation).

I went about my day until the first break when I was with the rest of the group just talking when a girl (17) that I hadn’t even had a proper conversation with, came to one of my other friends and told her that “if I don’t stop talking s**t, she would punch my head in”. From this point I instantly knew that my best friend had told them about my small rant. I went straight to the vice principal (he is normally the one who deals with threats of violence and fighting) with my other friend (17 F) who was apart of the group who told me about my childhoods friends badmouthing. I could not find the principal and at this time I had started to tear up. None of the other well-being staff were at the school or available at that time so my only option was the middle school well-being leader, he however was on his way to a meeting and gave me permission to sit inside a room with my friend and send him an email detailing what had happened( I had also cc’d my mother into it). 

I then spent my next class (which I had with my best friend) in another room with my middle schools friends trying to figure out how to move forward. I had gone to the toilet and was stopped by another leader who my childhood friend and the girl who threatened me had gone to, to complain about me “s**t talking”. From this I mentioned the email and  forwarded it to her. From this point I spent lunch in the same room and then went to my last classes. I then went home and talked to my parents about the situation and I had decided I did not want to bring the group into the situation because I didn’t wanna make people choose sides. My bf knew I was avoiding the two, however doesn’t know why and respects the fact I don’t wanna talk about it. 

At some point I caved and talked to my friend who was not apart of the group and had her own differing opinions about the two. She was good to talk to and didn’t tell anyone else and I appreciate that. My “twin brother” ( we look alike so we always joke that we are twins, we have convinced most of the teachers😂) had noticed that I had left the group all of a sudden during one of my breaks, he asked me about it and I told him I was avoiding someone and left because they showed up (both of them). That same day my best friend say next to me during class and tried to talk to me, I gave her simple replies and focused on my work ignoring most of her questions. I had gotten a glimpse of her laptop to see she was chatting with my childhood friend and were talking about me and how I had left during the break. 

The well-being leader I had originally emailed then got back to me (she was sick for a couple of days and couldn’t work) saying she could see me, from this I told her the situation had worsened and now more people were involved. I have a meeting set up during one of my breaks to get advice and talk it out. However the last time I talked to a well-being staff ( they had moved to another school) I was forced to have a “restorative meeting” where the staff and the other party just chit chatted the whole time. So I’m a bit nervous that it may happen again. 

 Another thing to mention is that my “twin brother” had figured out who I was avoiding and point blank asked me if I was avoiding my childhood friend. From this I folded and told him everything. He agrees that I’m doing the right thing for not getting others involved and splitting the group and just avoiding the two until I can talk to someone else. But I’m not entirely sure if it truely is the right thing. I told him I don’t wanna go up to them as most the time when I do, I get accused of going up to people to “fight” or “yell” at them. As I am known to be confrontational when it comes to my friends ( I have in fact protected my best friend several times through confronting bullies or other people). Do I am waiting for them to come to me, however I do not see that happening. 

So am I the AH ",TL;DR,2024-11-15,"AITAH for avoiding my childhood friend and best friend  So I (17 F) am struggling in what to do. I am apart of a friend group that all like and respect each other, we never cross each other’s boundaries and are always with each other. Our friend group is really large and has a very diverse set or personalities. My childhood friend (17 M), who I have known for roughly 12-13 years and my best friend (17 F) who I have known for 5-6, have started hanging out more often, I ofc didn’t think much of it as we are all friends and hang out separately from time to time. 2 weeks into the last term of the year I started hanging out and reconnecting with my middle school friends as I hadn’t spoken to them in a while, I’d spend every other break and/or class with them and just talk. 

From this I had learned that my childhood friend had been bad mouthing me, saying I had “ruined a 12 year friendship” and that I was “distancing myself from the group”. For context a couple weeks prior, I had gotten a bit upset at him because he was making inappropriate comments to our other friend (16 F) regarding some older (18-19) boys. She had decided she didn’t wanna deal with it and stopped being friends with him, from there he kept bringing it up even though he was told by teachers and others to not bring it up. She had asked me for advice and I had taken her to a well-being staff and she talked about it with me next to her. From this she told me he later apologised and that it was sorted out. To which I left it alone and didn’t bring it up. 

According to several people (not apart of the original group) had heard him constantly mention the whole situation and say that I was “acting this way” because of it and that he was badmouthing me. After finding this out I went to my next class with my best friend and had talked to her about it, as I was upset and would usually talk to her about things like that. From this I later texted her that night apologising since they were friends and she had said before she didn’t wanna be apart of “drama”. She had given me a really weird reply (in my and others opinion) saying she didn’t wanna be apart of drama and she didn’t like people talking bad about friends as she feels likes she betraying them and just thanked me for apologising. I had left it at that and went to school the next day, where I had emailed my year levels well-being leader to talk to her about the whole situation as I didn’t know what to do. At this point the only person that I had spoken to about this situation was my best friend and my mother (and the people who had told me about him badmouthing me, but they don’t really talk to him unless he starts the conversation).

I went about my day until the first break when I was with the rest of the group just talking when a girl (17) that I hadn’t even had a proper conversation with, came to one of my other friends and told her that “if I don’t stop talking s**t, she would punch my head in”. From this point I instantly knew that my best friend had told them about my small rant. I went straight to the vice principal (he is normally the one who deals with threats of violence and fighting) with my other friend (17 F) who was apart of the group who told me about my childhoods friends badmouthing. I could not find the principal and at this time I had started to tear up. None of the other well-being staff were at the school or available at that time so my only option was the middle school well-being leader, he however was on his way to a meeting and gave me permission to sit inside a room with my friend and send him an email detailing what had happened( I had also cc’d my mother into it). 

I then spent my next class (which I had with my best friend) in another room with my middle schools friends trying to figure out how to move forward. I had gone to the toilet and was stopped by another leader who my childhood friend and the girl who threatened me had gone to, to complain about me “s**t talking”. From this I mentioned the email and  forwarded it to her. From this point I spent lunch in the same room and then went to my last classes.

79,1grlehz,WIBTA if I got married without my family knowing?,"For context, I am not very close with my family. I rarely talk to or visit my sister, and our mother we both don't speak to anymore.. sort of. 
My sister cares about me deeply, but because of our age gap (12 years) and her living out of state, I don't update her often on what all is going on with my life. According to what she knows, I have poor taste in men. I'd rather skip the questions of what kind of person he is and how long have we been together, etc.. I want her to know, but I don't want to deal with the relationship interrogation.

Our mother, however, is a different story. She's a very self-centered ""better than thou"" type of woman. She's the type of person to ask ""Whats in it for me?"" before you even think of asking her for any help. She has a track record of being neglectful and rude to her children, husband, and friends if it benefited her more to do so. Hence, she has no husband, children, or friends anymore.  She would be devastated if I didn't involve her in any of it, but she would make the whole situation (engagement, wedding, honeymoon, etc.) all about her if she knew. I don't want that for my fiancé, especially because she would be the typical MIL. 

Side note: there is no money or family money to pay for the wedding. I come from a very low-class household, as does he, and all his family has passed.. whereas mine might chip in if I got closer with them.. but I wouldn't want to do that just to have our wedding paid for.

Would I be the asshole if I just enjoyed our wedding.. or rather more likely an elopement.. instead of cluing them in and letting them be a part of it?


Edit: Someone asked me if my sister would have cause of concern in order to ask those questions, and if I, in turn, was avoiding her in order to go through with it anyway.
As far as he goes, no, she wouldn't have cause for concern with this one. A lot of judgment from friends and family both when I informed them he's 5 yrs older and had been previously married with 2 kiddos. I've known him for 3 years, but we started dating early this year.

 My sister does know these answers, but she likes to keep asking questions because she was very reckless when it came to men at my age. She raised me when I was a baby/toddler because our mom would just forget I existed at times. Then she had moved out to get away from our mother when I was old enough to feed/cook for myself at the age of 5. I was left behind, and she started adult life earlier. Now that I'm in the adult world, we talk again. She knows her moving out made us distant, but I also know our mother had a play in it, too. She would speak badly about my sister all the time to me, and as a 6-year-old kid, she would tell me that she was going to ""hell"" because of her actions, and then, in detail, she would describe what she thought hell was like with a lot of gore and pain, and what my sister would do there.. I was SIX. I would call my sister bawling my eyes out begging her to not go to hell.

We aren't as close as I'd like to be, but with limited finances on both ends, we can't visit each other more than once a year, and our busy schedules have us calling MAYBE once a month. I'm always worried I'll disappoint her, but I know I'm not embarrassed of my boyfriend. She's just never met any of my ""partners"" and I'm worried how it would go if she knew... before or after.

At the time I do not feel bad about it, because The first time she ghosted me, particularly for months on end made me question our friendship. I'm not saying that I didn't cry in my room for a long time, but after a while it just kinda seems that I grew numb about the situation and stopped feeling any emotion regarding her.(rant)

One of my friends that is mutual friends with Nick it's starting to call me the asshole because she feels that I had no right to exclude her. I know the feeling of being excluded but nick had a whole melt down in the middle of class it just felt so immature of her.

After sitting on this for a while I'm starting to think I might be wrong.

But at the same time a lot of my friends who are involved in secret Santa really don't like Nick, she's had a habit of being genuinely annoying along with spreading false rumours behind peoples back.

81,1grl6mm,AITA for trying to encourage my bf to not risk losing his job??,"This sounds fairly straightforward and I thought it was too until he got mad at me. 

Relevant personal background: I have Asperger’s/ASD so I struggle with understanding if I violated social/relational rules and stuff. I do my best to keep the basics in mind, but when it comes to stuff like this I’m totally lost on if I messed up or not. 

I (21f) was talking to my partner (23m) on the phone and he mentioned he couldn’t hang out that day because he’d be staying late at work to prepare for a corporate visit. 

A little background: 
He is in a management position at a retail job, and his department is incredibly neglected as far as delegated hours go. He has a history of working off the clock just to cover his ass so he doesn’t get chewed out for stuff not being done. And I don’t mean staying a few minutes late once a week. I mean like 14hr days every day only getting paid for 8hrs per day. Recently HR approached him out of nowhere right at his off-time and told him he’s off the clock and to go home. Since then he’s been by the book not staying late unless it’s approved. 

Until the other day. 

So I say “hey I understand you’re stressed about this but it’s really not a good idea since they’re investigating you for this. It wasn’t a good idea before and it especially isn’t now. I know they’re gonna complain but they complain no matter how much work you put in so you might as well just go by the book and try not to lose your job over this.”

He said “I understand.” But then proceeded to be completely silent for the next 20 minutes. Silence on phone calls isn’t abnormal for us because we’re both introverted and like to just vibe and do our own thing while on the phone. 
But I could tell he was upset so I brought it up again like “hey what’s wrong? What’s on your mind?”

He said he made a decision and didn’t appreciate me arguing with him when he’s just doing what he thinks is best. 
I explained I was only trying to look out for him, but then things escalated. I felt like he wasn’t listening to me and he felt like I was nitpicking his choice. 

We sent a few texts back and forth (at this point the phone call died off) and I became exasperated and accused him of being emotionally unstable. I recognize now that it wasn’t right to say (and most certainly wasn’t the right time to bring up) but up until that point I really don’t feel like I’d done anything worth it becoming this huge. 

So I take an hour or so away from my phone and when I come back to message him “I love you, I’m sorry. Please let me know when you’re home safe.” 
I found out he’d blocked me. I couldn’t even find his user account (we primarily message on social media since SMS isn’t always the most convenient). 

I messaged him on a different platform to ask what’s going on and he said he needed space. I’m bewildered and confused and idk if I’m actually in the wrong here.

82,1grl6av,AITA for suggesting my teacher host my son's party at her house?,"Throwaway and fake names. I realize this was probably very petty but I want to see if I am justified or just an asshole and owe an apology.

My son ""Sam"" had his ninth birthday today, but we're having the actual ""party"" tomorrow night, which is basically just a sleepover at our apartment with two friends. One is in his class and the other in a different one(same school though). Before my son even got home from the bus I got a call from his teacher ""Lorna"" requesting that the party involve all the students in the class. She learned about it because it came up as the class wished him a happy birthday. I at first politely refused, saying that's not reasonable but she insisted to make sure nobody was left out. I respond by saying that she has no say in who is at my home ever and that even if she did, my apartment simply cannot accommodate 32 kids and guardians. She says that because other students are involved, she does and that I should have the party somewhere that can allow all students.

I tell her ""Okay, what's your address?"" and when she asks why, I told that since you think you have a say and you want all your students to be a part, we might as well have the party have her house, and request her address again. There's a pause before she says that's not exactly what she meant and I tell her that no, she wants everyone to attend so she should be the one to make it work, before hanging up.

This is where I probably became the asshole.

She responded to not send it and to do whatever I want for the birthday, she does not care anymore.

AITA.",Everyone Sucks,2024-11-15,"AITA for suggesting my teacher host my son's party at her house? Throwaway and fake names. I realize this was probably very petty but I want to see if I am justified or just an asshole and owe an apology.

My son ""Sam"" had his ninth birthday today, but we're having the actual ""party"" tomorrow night, which is basically just a sleepover at our apartment with two friends. One is in his class and the other in a different one(same school though). Before my son even got home from the bus I got a call from his teacher ""Lorna"" requesting that the party involve all the students in the class. She learned about it because it came up as the class wished him a happy birthday. I at first politely refused, saying that's not reasonable but she insisted to make sure nobody was left out. I respond by saying that she has no say in who is at my home ever and that even if she did, my apartment simply cannot accommodate 32 kids and guardians. She says that because other students are involved, she does and that I should have the party somewhere that can allow all students.

84,1grkcvl,WIBTAH if I continue to swear with my friends?,"All of the following names are fake including the one I use for myself. Ok so I (14f) do competitive gymnastics. I have a friend on my team called Amanda. Now me and her are pretty close but I’m not as close as her as I am to Nora, Lexi, and Katie. I have known Lexi for a long time more than every one else. So yesterday I came to practice as normal and Lexi and Nora started talking. Soon they called me over and Nora took out her phone and said,

“Zayden, Amanda added us to a group chat and said that we need to talk about your swearing problem.” I was very confused to say the least because why would she make a whole group chat about me with my other friends, talk about me, and try to have an intervention about me swearing. She said things like “My parents don’t want me going to anything she invited to because I’m a ‘bad influence’ and “it’s a sin in the Bible and my family is super religious like my dad doesn’t even like LGBTQ people. 

1. I am lesbian and finding out her dad is anti lgbtq makes me uncomfortable. 2. Can someone please tell me if swearing is actually a sin because I have never stepped foot into a church before. I get people have boundaries and her parents don’t want her swearing but all my friends and parents agree I am in the right. 

So here is where I may be in the wrong, I have decided that I will continue swearing just not in front of her parents. I never swear in front of adults on purpose. I plan on talking to her tomorrow and I’m glad I have friends that stand up for me when I’m not there they are my true friends I hope they know that. 

Anyway, advice is always welcome because I’m in a bit of a predicament I will update you on how it goes. Make sure to eat, sleep, drink, and take care of yourself love yall bye 💕.

85,1grjwvt,AITA for telling my Dad I am not going to either of my grandparents funeral? ,"I 25f and my father got into a pretty lengthy argument about me attending his parents funerals.  

The last time I spoke to them was when I was 16. Through my young adult years they did nothing significant to spend anytime with me. When I was 9 years old my grandfather told me “my golf trip was more important than attending your communion”.  He had already postponed it twice and didn’t want to disappoint his friends again. Since he was not going to be there, my grandmother predicted that something would go wrong.  My grandmother asked my 10 year old brother to save a pew for my aunt and uncle who were running late. He was uncomfortable to do so and it was near impossible because of the church being packed.  Although, my father had taken care of this by asking my brother to sit in a pew and save the seats for our Aunt’s family. A year later they cut my family and I off because of whole communion ordeal. 

Since they never really respected me, why should I pay respects to them at their funeral?   My father thinks I should be the better person and go. I shouldn’t let other peoples inappropriate actions influence the type of person I am. However, I feel they wouldn’t come to my funeral if I passed before them. In example, I had complicated surgery earlier this year and when my father told my grandfather about it. He said and did nothing.  With all of this I don’t want to attend their funerals when they do pass. Am I the asshole here?

86,1grjg6f,AITA for sharing my insecurities with my best friend?,"My best friend (F21) and I (F22) have been close for almost a decade. Over the years, I’ve always felt a bit intimidated by her because she’s always been more confident, while I’ve struggled with self-esteem. Despite this, I’ve always been happy for her, especially since she’s had her own struggles.

Earlier this year, I started hanging out with an old high school friend who introduced me to her group of friends. As my old group started drifting apart, I invited my best friend to hang out with them, not wanting her to feel left out. My new friends were nice to her, and I made an effort to include her.

I can struggle with being possessive in friendships, though I never let anyone see it because I know it’s unhealthy. I pour myself into my friendships and often feel I don’t get the same back, which is fine, but it would be nice to be treated the way I treat others.

As my best friend bonded more with my new friends, I began to feel uneasy. This feeling came from a past experience when one of my oldest friends ditched me after getting close to her boyfriend’s group, which was traumatic for me. So, I started feeling anxious that the same thing might happen with my best friend and my new group of friends, even though they'd given no reason for me to think that.

One day at lunch, my friend noticed I was acting off and asked if something was wrong. I told her I didn’t want to talk about it, but she insisted, so I confessed that I felt uncomfortable with her getting close to my new friends. I admitted that I struggled with changes in friendship dynamics, but I didn’t want to seem possessive or jealous. She seemed to understand, but the next day, while hanging out with our new friends, she laughed and said I was jealous of her new friendships.

This hurt me because I felt she had broken my trust by bringing up something I had confided in her. I called her out, but she argued that she hadn’t said anything false. I ended up backtracking, probably because I felt ashamed, and we apologized to each other.

Then, last week, I found out through other people that she had been chatting with a guy we met at a bar. We usually share everything about boys, so I was surprised she hadn’t told me. That night, I joked about finding out from other people, but it wasn’t meant maliciously. She later apologized, saying she hadn’t told me because she feared I’d be jealous.

She told me that our earlier conversation about jealousy had made her self-conscious, which left me confused. I clarified that I wasn’t actually jealous about her flirting with a guy, and that my concerns had been about our changing friend group dynamics. We talked it out, and she apologized, but I’m still left feeling upset.

I feel torn because I think I might have made things more complicated, but at the same time, I think my friend has been insensitive to my feelings.

This past weekend(Sunday), we all gathered for my sons 4th birthday celebration and while he was opening presents my sister announced she was pregnant and I was livid! So when she said, ""Mommy and Daddy were so shocked,"" I responded, ""yeah, I bet they were. You guys are living in their basement."" I know that was an a-hole thing to say, but there it is. After the party, I sent her a text to say I was sorry that I said anything about their living arrangements and it wasn't any of my business. She never responded. Which is her right.

I have two kids and at no point did I ever think to ask someone else to do the heavy lifting to reveal my kids gender. I am more than happy to plan her a baby shower, but this should be on her.
