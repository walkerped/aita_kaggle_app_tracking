1,1gt05yl,AITA for not telling a friend who said something mean about them,"I (M16) and my friend (F16), I will call her Amy, got in to a bit of an argument. I recently went out with a few male  friends and we started to talk about girls and Amy came up. One of my friends mentioned something along the lines of “all I know about Amy is that she is a bop”. I asked why he thought that and he said that she is always talking and hanging out with a new guy, plus that’s what other people have told him. I explained that she just likes flirting, but doesn’t actually get along with any guys, but that I can understand how that could be misinterpreted as such. Later the next day, another friend sent a photo of her talking to another person in the chat as a joke (Amy is in that chat) I remembered what my friend told me that night and since I knew she cares about her reputation, I thought it important to mention what he said. So I tell her and she ask for a name, which I didn’t give because not only is the person that said it very important to me, they said it among people that he trust. She kept asking about, saying she wouldn’t speak badly about the person that said it and she just wanted to know how to trust, not sure what she meant by that. I still said know and she said that she would loose respect for me if I didn’t say the persons name. And that asked me why I was defending this person so much. At that point I got fed up and did something I currently regret. It told her the honest truth and it was I didn’t trust her. That I’ve only know her for about 3-4 months and that the people she sometimes hang out with have spoken shit about me before, and the lasting I wanted was to put someone I really care about in problems. After 2 minutes of that message I quickly deleted it and changed it to “I apologize for bringing it up.” Which is when I realized o screwed up having the convo of a chat with other friends (3 others people). The rest of the chat has continued of talk like nothing happened. 

TLDR: I told my female friend and another friend of mine had the idea of her being a bop and she got mad I didn’t give her the name of the person because I know they didn’t say it with malice and they just didn’t know her personally. Plus, that person said that with trust  and I didn’t wanna break that trust.

2,1gt012b,AITA for not paying back my friend for the concert she promised she'd go but didn't.,"1(21F) wanted to attend a concert in Atlanta, but the total cost (ticket and flight) was $435. I first asked two friends, but they both declined because of money. One of them suggested I ask our mutual friend, Lily. I didn't know Lily well, so I decided to ask my friend Jade first. I had been close with Jade for about a year, but recently, she'd been doing some things that were making me upset. For example, she had backed out of plans literally an hour before for an assigned seat trip I had booked. When I didn't ask her to hang out as much after that, she asked why and I told her everything that had been bothering me and instead of apologizing, she just focused on the fact that she knew something was wrong.
I put it in the past and I asked Jade if she'd go to the concert, I detailed all the info about flights, dates, and costs, and told her to email her professors about missing class on Monday if she wanted to go. She said yes, agreeing to pay me back since her card wasn't working at the time. I booked everything.
Then, a few days later, she told me she couldn't go because of a midterm on the Monday. Since I had already told her before to email her professors, I assumed she didn't want to go, so I started looking for someone else. I told her she would need to pay the $75 name change fee for the flight. She agreed. Next, I asked Lily, the friend who I was going to call after Jade if she had said no. Lily had practice on Monday, and her coach wouldn't let her miss it. (Note that if Jade just told me no, then I would've gone to the Saturday concert instead of the Sunday concert with Lily, flig gets back the next day). I also asked my other friend Penny, but she said the trip was too expensive.

A few days later, Jade messaged me saying she got the test moved. I was frustrated, but agreed. She slowly paid me back over a month.
However, a few days after that, Jade told me she didn't want to go anymore because it would be awkward since we hadn't talked much lately. I said ""okay,"" but I was frustrated. I started to ask everyone I knew, I had asked around 30 people and posted about the tickets, but no one could go due to class, work, or money. I was willing to go alone, but I really did not want to go to Atlanta by myself. I still tried to sell just Jade's ticket on tickpick where I got it from to pay her back, but no one bought it.

Right before the time was up to be able to change the name on the plane ticket, I called Penny, she said it was too expensive so l offered to let her pay just the name change fee. She agreed, and we went to the concert together. Jade saw Penny's post about the concert and asked for her ticket money ($300) back. I explained to Jade how I tried to get back her money but couldn't.
Jade said she wants her money back from either me or Penny. Penny doesn't have the money and neither do I since $300 is literally my entire paycheck exactly for 2 weeks.

3,1gszh0a,WIBTA if I didn’t put my partners names on our group project?,"Throwaway for privacy, I’ll also probably obscure some details because I don’t want this to somehow spread IRL. Also sorry if this is kind of a ramble/sounds weird, new to Reddit posting LOL.

Anyway, there's a decent bit of context required for this. A. Where I live, in our schools we have this mandatory science course, so basically a lot of people who struggle or don't like science still had to take it. B. At least at my school, a decent amount of people are jerks, not like complete bully but still rude, think more wannabe gangster. C. I am a gigantic science nerd, and usually at the business end of annoying people at school.

So in this science class we had to create this lab report, hypothesis & procedure & all that. It's a group project, and I was paired with some people I didn't know too well. However, after doing the entire experiment we had to write a lab report about by myself, I knew this would be a painful assignment. The most they could do was write down our observations, and badly at that. But it was alright, I like doing experiments and honestly I've had worse.

After we divide who's doing what for the report and go along with our day. This happened near the beginning of the week, so we had the entire week and the weekend to do our parts. I quickly finished one of my sections and decided to wait until the weekend to do the other. So I didn't look at our shared document for a while.

Friday comes, I check the document, nothing besides my work. Considering it's due MONDAY I panic, but anyway I immidiately start thinking of what the hell to do. I figure that if push comes to shove I'll just write the whole thing myself and submit it for us. (Note: We all get the same grade based on the overall lab, so if I just put all our names on it we'll all get the marks). Here's where I might become the A-hole. I remember our professor told us that if we wanted we could submit a lab report by ourself if we didn't trust our group to do a good job. I did consider doing this earlier but I felt bad leaving them alone. But now with this enitre lab on my shoulders I start actually considering doing it. 

So I either write the entire lab report by myself and A. Only put my name on it or B. Say we all did it. It was just a thought until I brought it up with friends and family, and they agreed they didn't deserve the credit. So WIBTA if I only put my name on the lab instead of including them?

I'll add some additional info here if I think of any:

- So far my group members have either made fun of me, cheated on the work with mine and said really nasty things in general.
- Since we technically made groups, we're not really supposed to complain, but my professor also assigned this one to make groups smaller, so I might be able to complain about it?
- My group members might potentially fall into failing territory if they get a 0, they have time to make it up but I worry if they will.
- I don't fully need the marks but my total is certainly lower than usual (due to previous lab group making less crazy mistakes, and me messing up bad on our first chemistry test)
- I'm terrified of the drama, I don't get full on harrased but definitely bothered for being smart(ish), looking effeminate for a guy, and being a theater kid, LOL.

4,1gszgtj,AITA for not inviting my parents to the opening night afterparty of a musical I’m in?,"I am a musical theatre actress (25F), currently in rehearsals at one of my country’s national theatres for a musical. I’m an understudy for two female lead roles and also a member of the ensemble. This is a big deal for me professionally.

Recently, my parents told me they booked an Airbnb in the city for opening night so they could attend the afterparty. This came as a huge surprise because I never mentioned inviting them and didn’t expect they’d assume they were coming. As far as I know, the party is only for the cast members and maybe their significant others—not for family.

When I explained this to my parents, it turned into a huge argument. My mom started crying, and my dad yelled at me. They insisted that actors always invite their loved ones to such events and that it’s normal for them to attend. My father, who works in the music industry, has connections with a lot of theatre people and has somehow managed to get into opening night parties before, even for productions he wasn’t involved in. They both argued that I was being ungrateful and insulting them by not inviting them, especially since they’ve supported me and my career.

For context, my parents have always wanted to be deeply involved in my life. They can be overbearing, always wanting to know everything and seeking validation for how well they’ve raised me. They crave compliments for the role they’ve played in my success, which can feel suffocating at times.

I’ve spoken to some of my colleagues about this, and most of them don’t even have anyone coming to the premiere. They weren’t even sure if they’re allowed to invite significant others to the afterparty. I also told my parents that I wouldn’t even invite my best friends to the party because this night is about me and the rest of the cast having fun together, celebrating what we’ve accomplished. I even reassured them that I love them and am incredibly grateful for everything they’ve done for me.

This night is about my work and my relationships with my theatre friends. For once, I want to enjoy my success without feeling like I’m in my dad’s shadow.

To make things even more complicated, I’m currently living with them, so this argument has made things really tense at home.

5,1gszgqw,AITA because I verbally scorched my uncle for being cruel to a first date? ,"I, 54(f) just had a visit from my 70 yr old uncle.  I should have known better but I asked him if he’s been to any ‘senior singles’ dances lately, which is his favourite thing to do as a lonely widower.  He told my husband and I that he invited a lady he had met on a ‘seniors dating app’ to a dance.  He likes to arrive early so he can “size things up” when they walk in the door.  While laughing he described how he tried to hide his face hoping she wouldn’t see him when his date arrived.  Why? Because she was “wearing running shoes and a  huge dress that looked like a tent.” 
But she spotted him and so he took her for a couple dances then ditched her to go sit with the ladies who were “dressed to the nines as women should be, especially at a dance”  and then, with those ladies, pointed and laughed at his poor date.  
He can be rude and blunt and cruel if women don’t meet his expectations and every woman in our family has called him out including his own daughters.  
Well, today wasn’t the day because I ripped into him pointing out the irony of his expectations, considering he might not exactly be a catch himself.  I told him he was rude and offensive and he’ll continue to stay single (and a LOT more).  I stood up from the table and left the room, signalling the visit was over. 
He said goodbye to my husband and left.  I asked my husband if I had been too harsh and he said yes, because he’s old and won’t change anyway, and that my bad behaviour is equivalent to his.  So AITA?

7,1gsz1iq,AITA for giving my gf half of my energy drink…,"For context, I have been with my girlfriend for 9 years. We have had some tough times but the last couple of months have been extremely tough. I lost my mom at the end of august and ever since my girlfriend has been HORRIBLE towards me. 

I found out she had been cheating on me shortly after my mom passed, i confronted her about it and then she said it was my fault because i haven’t been showing her enough attention. mind you, i had been dealing with my mother dying and then her death but i haven’t really been able to grieve her…

fast forward to now and it hasn’t gotten much better.

9,1gsxikl,AITA for asking husband to help?,"Hi everyone,

I’m feeling at my wits’ end and could use some perspective. My daughter is 9 months old and has always been a terrible sleeper. Since she was born, I’ve been the one getting up with her at night, which I didn’t mind initially because I was breastfeeding and on maternity leave.

But now I’m back at work as an early childhood teacher, and her sleep issues are really wearing me down. Some nights, she wakes up every hour. I’m lucky if I get 2-3 hours of broken sleep. I don’t mind getting up once or twice to breastfeed her, but dealing with her waking up hourly is killing me. We’re trying to sleep train her, but since we live in an apartment, we’re trying to keep the crying to a minimum so we don’t disturb the neighbors.

The issue is, I asked my husband to help out at night by soothing her occasionally so I could get a bit more rest. His response? He said his job is too demanding and requires meetings with important people, implying mine isn’t as important. He’s an engineer, and I work with kids all day, which takes a ton of energy.

Am I wrong for feeling pissed off about this? I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask for help now that I’m also back at work. I just need a bit of support so I don’t completely burn out.

11,1gswjja,AITA for arguing with my dad over a “worthless blanket”?,"I am trying to keep this as vague as possible, because I don’t want any chance of my dad seeing this post, so please know that all names are fake, and some *minor* details have been changed. (also please forgive any typos.)

I (19F) start college next fall after taking a gap year to work. I’ve already been accepted into my dream school, and everything involved with that has already started, I’m actually very excited for the future. My dad (47M) is only arguing with me about one thing.

I have a baby blanket that I cannot sleep without. It has gone everywhere with me. It’s very important to me, and everyone in my life knows how special it is. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve called it Blankie. The reason it is so important to me is because I’ve had it my entire life. It was there the day I was born. My grandmother on my dad’s side really wanted a granddaughter, so when she found out that I was a girl, she bought Blankie for me. Unfortunately, she had a heart attack about 2 weeks before I was born, and passed away. I never got to meet her, which is why that blanket is so important to me.

My dad is insistent that I am not allowed to bring Blankie with me to college, because it’s childish and I need to grow up. He doesn’t understand why I bring it with me everywhere, it actually makes him really mad for some reason. The problem is that my college is 3 states away, and due to financial issues, I will not be able to go home for winter or summer breaks. If I don’t bring Blankie with me, I will not see it for 4 years, and there is a chance my parents throw it away. 

My dad and I have been arguing about this for weeks now, and it has gotten to the point that he is completely ignoring me. I’m not sure what to do about it. I really don’t see the huge problem with a baby blanket. I wash it every week, and it doesn’t leave my bed. I know deep down it’s silly, but I genuinely cannot sleep at night if I don’t have Blankie. AITA?

Edit: I’ve seen a couple comments about this, and would just like to clear it up. I don’t bring Blankie with me to every single place I go. It barely leaves the house. I usually only bring it with me if I know 100% I’m staying somewhere overnight, and even then, it stays in my bag until night time. I don’t bring the blanket around like Linus from The Peanuts (but shout out to the commenter that said that, I almost cried laughing). No hate to anyone, just wanted to clear it up! Thank you for all of the comments and advice. Sorry I took so long to reply to some of you, I was at work lol.

Update : Blankie is gone. I woke up this morning and couldn’t find it, and immediately knew deep down my dad did something. I went downstairs and confronted him, to which he admitted he took it. Most of you thought he would hide it or throw it away, he did something so much worse. He burned it. He actually burned my baby blanket and feels absolutely no guilt for it. I’m heart broken, I haven’t stopped crying. The only thing I had to connect me to my grandma is gone. He says he did it “for my own good”.

12,1gswfbc,AITA- Keeping my husband from his family on Christmas,"So, my (31f) husband (32m) is from *abroad* and doesn't get to see his family very often. This year we plan to be in his country of origin for about 3 weeks over the Christmas holiday. Now, he's aware that I have strained relationship with my parents and that the holidays are difficult for me. And even though I like his family and love spending Christmas with them, I don't particularly feel close to them and tend to feel isolated at his family gatherings. My husband gets so excited to see his friends and family that he often doesn't plan any accomodations around me. He mentioned he'd be spending a day with his friends and joked that he didn't know what to do with me (which usually leads to me being alone for the day with no where to go). 

I asked if we could have one evening that's just us, on a date, and he immediately dismissed it. He said he hasn't gotten to see his family in three years (only half true since both sides of his immediate family visited here this year) and he doesn't want any time away from them. I should also note that in our 8 years of marriage, he Skype calls his family every single weekend, so they are extremely close. I told him that we  never really got the opportunity to travel, it's my only time to be in *country* and it's my vacation time too, so we should be able to plan at least one date night to enjoy together. He was persistent that I was asking for too much, I asked if there was any way he'd at least consider a compromise and he said no.

Usually we never fight and get a long well together, but I'm upset that he's being so rigid on this. He eventually conceded but said he now felt pressure to factor in time with me, too. Now I feel bad for taking away time with his family. I'm thinking that maybe because I don't have a close family relationship, it might be inconsiderate of me to expect time carved aside for me. Am I being unreasonable?  

Tldr; I asked my husband if we could spend an evening together during our holiday trip to see his family (not *on* Christmas Day) and he reluctantly agreed while saying I was putting pressure on him to plan time around me when his friends and family are demanding his time, too.

14,1gsw6vp,AITA for kicking my partner out every time i reverse park?,"First i wanna say that english is not my first language and i struggle to write sometimes, hope you understand this post.

I (20F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been together 1,5 years. I’ve gotten my drivers license recently in February 2024 and decided to get my own car in April/May. As an important side note, my boyfriend is a mechanic and is really interested in cars and takes a really good care of both of our vehicles. 

I learnt quickly how to drive on my own and i always wanted to learn how to reverse park. However, it was difficult for me to learn it because the car in my driving school was brand new and had reverse camera and reversing radar and it was easy to learn to reverse park with it. I didn’t want my first car to be all fancy and decided to buy 2009 Toyota which obviously doesn’t have either. I learnt it quickly with my car (surprisingly watching Youtube tutorials).
 
I can reverse park really good when i am alone, but when my boyfriend is in the passenger seat, i stress out and mess up the whole thing and have to start over and over fixing the parking. The problem is, he does not want to shut up and let me park and figure it out in peace, he will give me unclear instructions and freak out for over everything. Honestly it makes me feel like he thinks i am a complete dumbass that has to be instructed all the time.

At first i was thinking that he just wanted to teach me as good as he can but it got annoying very quickly. After first few times i said politely that i’d like to focus on this as good as i can and figure it out myself. He was quiet for a while, but continued to teach me after seconds and it went like that for like a month. Until one time i just got extremely annoyed and said ”you know what, this is my car and if you keep doing that after i already told you several times i want you to be quiet, you are stepping out and wait for me to park this car or you can also stay at home, i don’t care.” He stepped out and got really sad that i snapped and i apologized later. Nonetheless, i’ve kept my boundaries and before everytime i’m about to park i’ll ask him to step out and he will watch it outside of the car with slightly irritated look.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-16,"AITA for kicking my partner out every time i reverse park?

15,1gsvw5j,AITA for not going to my sister’s baby shower and visiting my girlfriend’s family instead?,"So me (M23) and my gf (F22) of 3 years are at odds with my family. My family has made it very obvious that they don’t like my gf for me. So after I moved in with her, we don’t really come around too often. My family is very conservative while me and my gf are pretty liberal. And at this point, my gf is basically my wife, I’m just unable to afford a ring for her. Her father approved

My family would often tell me I could do better, and that I shouldn’t settle this early in my life. But I love my gf and that’s my choice to make. Things got worse when my sister (F29) stalked my gf’s social media and found that she follows “demonic accounts”. I said “oh well!” And that was that. My family is Christian, I’m agnostic, and my gf is agnostic but still spiritual (she does rituals that her family has passed down for generations)

Unfortunately we had a miscarriage. My dad told us that our baby is waiting for us in Heaven and that we should go to church with him. Meanwhile my sister told me that our mentally ill mother (BPD) tried to recruit her into a plot to break me and my gf up using the miscarriage somehow. This especially hurt me since my mother was in the room with us when we got the ultrasound and they didn’t find a heartbeat. But it was nice to know my sister looked out for me.

My dad also sent me a very offensive meme about my gf and told me that she indoctrinated me. He went on to say how sad and hurt he is that I am the way that I am.

Some background on my sister: she helped me out in really dark times. I was severely depressed while living with my abusive dad. She let me move in with her and her husband while I got myself back on my feet. And I will forever be grateful for that. But this is also the same sister that said I shouldn’t settle for my gf, stalked her social media, and called her a “witch” to me

Now she’s is having a baby shower on the same day I accidentally planned a trip to my gf’s mother’s house. I’ve already declined visiting her mother twice before because I hate going to that godforsaken city. But I figured that I should visit her sometime. My gf said she knows it doesn’t mean I love her any less if I go to my sister’s baby shower. But I don’t want her to have to call her mother and say “he’s not coming again”. And I don’t want her to drive hours by herself to her mother’s since she will go without me.

I had a difficult decision to make. So I called my sister and told her I won’t be making it to the baby shower. I told her I’m still getting her what I can from the baby registry, I’ll just be a few days late to actually give these gifts to her. I also said that I still love her and support her, I just can’t bail on my gf and her family again

My sister said it doesn’t feel like I love and support her since this will also be the first year I spend Thanksgiving with my gf’s family.

Am I an asshole for this? ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-16,"AITA for not going to my sister’s baby shower and visiting my girlfriend’s family instead? So me (M23) and my gf (F22) of 3 years are at odds with my family. My family has made it very obvious that they don’t like my gf for me. So after I moved in with her, we don’t really come around too often. My family is very conservative while me and my gf are pretty liberal. And at this point, my gf is basically my wife, I’m just unable to afford a ring for her. Her father approved

My family would often tell me I could do better, and that I shouldn’t settle this early in my life. But I love my gf and that’s my choice to make. Things got worse when my sister (F29) stalked my gf’s social media and found that she follows “demonic accounts”. I said “oh well!” And that was that. My family is Christian, I’m agnostic, and my gf is agnostic but still spiritual (she does rituals that her family has passed down for generations)

Unfortunately we had a miscarriage. My dad told us that our baby is waiting for us in Heaven and that we should go to church with him. Meanwhile my sister told me that our mentally ill mother (BPD) tried to recruit her into a plot to break me and my gf up using the miscarriage somehow. This especially hurt me since my mother was in the room with us when we got the ultrasound and they didn’t find a heartbeat. But it was nice to know my sister looked out for me.

My dad also sent me a very offensive meme about my gf and told me that she indoctrinated me. He went on to say how sad and hurt he is that I am the way that I am.

Some background on my sister: she helped me out in really dark times. I was severely depressed while living with my abusive dad. She let me move in with her and her husband while I got myself back on my feet. And I will forever be grateful for that. But this is also the same sister that said I shouldn’t settle for my gf, stalked her social media, and called her a “witch” to me

Now she’s is having a baby shower on the same day I accidentally planned a trip to my gf’s mother’s house.

It wasn't anything too dramatic but we didn't end on great terms (I want kids, he said he did too, turns out he lied to me about it for almost 2 years hoping to change my mind). At the time, he had a pair of concert tickets that were a birthday gift to me, and I had another set for another concert later in the year with some friends. Right after the split I asked to buy the birthday tickets from him because they were for my favourite artist and not a group he cared about. He sent them and didn't ask for money, so I asked if he wanted me to send the other tickets as a trade. I got no response, but I transferred one ticket to him anyway as a gesture and I kept the other (it's general admission and we both had friends going so I figured he may still want to go with them, and it wasn't like we would sit next to each other). We've been no contact since then. The show is now a week away and I logged into ticketmaster to try and get another ticket for a friend only to see my ex never accepted the ticket transfer. The GA section is also now sold out. He's a very type-A guy and not usually the type to leave a ticket sitting in his inbox for 4 months, so I'm inclined to think he's not going (this is also not a group he really follows).

18,1gsvgn4,AITA for not letting this girl hit my cart?,"I'm 18F from NYC, and I'm reaching the end of my first semester of college in Greece. I've been having an amazing time, not too arsed about this but wanted to post it on here lol

Weed is super illegal here but my friend and I recently found a well-reviewed shop that sells THC-P carts which got us high so we each bought two, but I'm out of cash and my debit card just expired so I can't buy more without my parents seeing the charge on my card. So I'm basically tryna make these ones last for the next month before I go back to the states.

We were in my other friends' hotel room (five of us) and two more girls who I'm not friends with but know of came, I was really really vibing with one of them and the other one (""Jane"") really didn't acknowledge me but I was too drunk to care at first. I was letting people hit my cart on the balcony and it was a good vibe.

My friend said she was ready to leave (we're sort of sharing each cart btw to try to make them last so we only had my first one) so I told her we cld go soon after a girl I promised hit the cart. Jane then came outside and smelled it and asked who had weed, the girl pointed to me and I smiled at Jane as people do. She looked me dead up and down straightfaced and said something along the lines of ""that's new, I would've thought your parents are strict as fuck or something."" I'm Indian. Mind you, I've never spoken to this girl before, so she has nothing to have ""thought"" of pertaining to me besides what I look like.

Lol I'm laughing now bc I feel like having strict parents is literally the reason I'm a secret stoner so she was exactly wrong abt the weed but right with the stereotyping. Anyway she asked to hit the cart and I swerved her. Not very well, I pretended my friend called my name to leave and I yelled ""ok coming"" out of nowhere and walked inside, grabbed her and we left. It was probs so obvious lmfao. She apparently complained after we left that I was rude and let everyone hit my cart except her, no one cares that much and I've said that we just had to leave suddenly but she gave me a few dirty looks td.

I know it wasn't blatant racism at all and I wasn't super offended by the comment but is it not just lowkey weird to assume my parents are strict bc I'm brown on top of being rude-ish while asking to get faded afff of my shii.

19,1gsv7sg,AITAH for telling my husband that his mother is too dependent on him?,"My husband and I have been together for 9 years. My husband grew up in a financially unstable household during his childhood. His family was barely scraping by. To add to this, he lost his father at a very young age due to a terminal illness. They didn’t have any money left for his education, even to get by for a few weeks.

To be able to pay for college, my husband worked his ass off. He worked multiple jobs during the course of the degree and paid for his college and living expenses himself. He worked harder to earn more money and gave it to his family as well as there was no source of income for them. He comes from a very rural part of India where women are not allowed to work. It’s considered taboo.

Fast forward, he has worked hard for the last 10 years and is now earning decent money. His family is also out of the difficult situation and I am extremely proud of him for what he’s achieved. Paying for 4-5 people’s every expense is not an easy task at all. I knew about his financial difficulties at home from day one. (He wasn’t doing well financially when we first met). All this while, I knew that his family would be dependent on him financially for the entire course of our marriage and I have no problem with it. He is extremely supportive and generous with his family and ME. In fact, he takes care of 70% of our household expenses and our international trips as well. I have a well paying job too so I pay our mortgage. 

Since he is already so burdened with their expenses and has been since he was 16, I feel that weird that his mother burdens him with her emotional challenges as well as if he is her therapist. She calls him for every little thing 2-3 times a day and ends up stressing him out. There are days when he is so stressed that his mother is sad that he doesn’t sleep or eat well. I feel that my MIL should not think of him as a replacement of her husband EMOTIONALLY. She can’t expect him to have answers to all her emotional needs. She has to allow him to have a life of his own. This happens quite frequently where he spends hours consoling her. I have no problem if they talk for hours but on happy topics that won’t stress him out. 

So I told him that his mother needs to have some boundaries about calling him for every little thing and that she should just realise that he has a life of his own. She should learn to handle a few dilemmas on her own and not stress him out every time. I repeat, I don’t have a problem that he supports her financially.

He lashed out at me and said that I don’t understand her side of the story and she is so dependent on him because she lost her husband so she has no one else.

I moved away from home for uni and made friends, this friend being one of them. Our friendship accelerated unhealthy fast, bonding over failed friendships and past traumas. For context: we are both biological females with autism; they are a year younger than me; they are a bit of a snowflake and are pretty non-threatening, while I tend to be more ""scary"" and sarcastic with a dark sense of humour. I also said I wouldn't drop them as a friend before all this and I am the type to always keep my word. 

Soon they were pushing my expressed boundaries and never giving me my space. I was in a friendship I was explicitly not ok with, having met their extended family [they all think we're dating but that's neither here nor there] and knowing their deepest secrets. They would emotionally manipulate and sexually harass me. This would mostly happen on Snapchat or in private (so I have no proof), but occasionally with friends that would pick up on it but not think it anything other than a weird friendship. I didn't want to cause problems in our friendship group so decided to endure it. Especially because I had no other people around me. 

I told them I wouldn't be their friend if the sexual harassment kept up, and they did stop, but the other manipulation continued. This was a huge step for me because of my people-pleasing nature and anxiety not usually letting me call people out. It's also why it lasted so long and got so bad, I'm aware that I am at fault here. 

At some point, their mum got ill, which made me stop trying to distance myself so I could be there for them. Over a month past of me constantly helping them out and making sure they eat as they were having a hand time and needed it. I intended to continue making space when she got better, but she didn't, putting my plans on hold indefinitely. This whole thing brought them closer to me undoing all my efforts to loosen our ties. They seem to have no recollection of any of the stuff they put me through for months because of the ordeal.

It doesn't become a problem until I talk about being socially drained, being harassed by random people, or my mental health deteriorating from putting others' feelings before my needs. They become my most vocal advocate, ignorant of the fact they've been the worst perpetrator.  I don't want shame or atonement just accountability, which they don't have because they don't remember.

23,1gstk46,AITA for not going to Friendsgiving,"I(26M) live with my friend, Mike(70sM). I have a severe panic disorder that keeps me from working and I'm currently trying to get on disability for it. In the past few weeks, I was able to identify some of the triggers for my panic attacks and those are: leaving the house, being in a car, and being in crowded areas. 

Today is friendsgiving with the volunteer organization i used to volunteer for and where Mike is still a volunteer. Leading up to today, I had agreed to go with him and bring homemade cranberry sauce. This morning, I realized if I went, I would very likely have a panic attack during and after the event. Its a small building with a lot of people going and it hits all the boxes for a panic attack.

To add further context, I don't really have friends there, just people i'm friendly with. And theres a high chance someone, who i'll call Tom(20sM), will be there because he works there. We used to be really good friends and I risked a lot to help him out of a bad situation only for him to turn around and treat me horribly and make me homeless. I avoid him whenever I can and, to his credit, he also avoids me. But like I said, its a small building.

I told Mike I didn't want to go because I don't want to trigger a panic attack. The only way I could go would be if I took my panic meds. But my panic meds make me incredibly tired and the event, i've been to 3 of these Friendsgivings, is slow to start and I'm worried I'll just conk out before food is even served. I told Mike the cons outweigh the pros in this situation. 

He was visibly disappointed and told me that it was my choice but ""in a way it might be good"" for me. He thinks I'll be fine if I go, despite knowing the above information. I've pushed myself a lot in the last month to help him with events and I really don't think I can handle the stress. I'm still making the cranberry sauce so he can take it with him(its a potluck).

So, I asked her to wait until I removed my clothes before taking down the decorations. She suggested I compromise by letting her take the decorations down in just one day instead of waiting two days potentially.

I responded that I didn’t really need to compromise in this situation because it’s *my* balcony. I also didn't feel like compromising cause I don't think it's a big deal for her to wait two days to take them down.

It is a nice view and as it's a small quiet drive in the country you can look out the car window without getting carsick which is what I was doing.


I used to go to this particular old Girl Scout camp, so I looked over on the drive purely for a nostalgic vibe.  When the car was driving past the camp, I saw the girls scouts were growing pumpkins this year, they were getting pretty big to see from the road. So I took a photo on my phone to show to Ruby .  


She text back (Are you accusing me of  wanted to steal from a camp!???


Let me tell you, when I read that text, I was so confused, and kept trying to explain in text I just thought that u like pumpkins. That was it.

However, Ruby  refused to lesson to me, and ghosted me for three days.
Yes, I tried calling her, but my calls went right to her voicemail.

But later Ruby  called me and said we could talk at the gym, and when she said ‘we talk’, she really meant she was talking.

When I got to the gym, Ruby  still didn’t let me explain why my text of a  pumpkins had gotten her so mad.

Ruby  kept cutting me off, over and over again, and kept saying “Dabney!  Dabney .. Stop it!  Don't lie to me!” She didn’t sound mad at this point, just tired but also over confident like she knew all the answers and she wasn't gonna take any crap from me as if I was the one being difficult that day.
So conversation was basically like this

( me) But…
(Ruby )I don't want to hear it.
( me) But…
(Ruby  )OP!
( me) But…
(Ruby )OP! Don't lie to me! You know I can tell when your lying.

But I remember I kept saying ‘sorry’  to her anyway, even though I still had no idea what I was apologizing for. Which i'm well aware now is a massive red flag in a so-called friendship.   
Then she finally turned to me( we were both on a treadmill at the gym, she was at top speed, I was at the lowest speed)
she turned to me and asked “OP, do you understand why what you did was wrong?”

So even though highly suspected there was another issue here that clearly wasn't about pumpkins I was too scared to ask about her mom or her sister. Mentioning either one would just put her in a worse mood.
So, instead I just nodded my head and said something along the lines of ""Yes, I'm sorry, it won't happen again” to make her happy. Yes, you read that right I'm afraid not only did I not confront her but I cowardly caved and simply apologized but I did ask if she was going to apologize for how she reacted in which I got a quick “No, I've done nothing wrong!” from her.

That made me mad, I wish I was brave enough to stop the treadmill right then walk out of the
As you can guess, Ruby  never did apologizes, and there would be several other times she got  mad at me randomly, and seemingly out of nowhere.
But instead of standing up for myself, I just pulled an Elisa from the movie Frozen and ‘let it go.’

Edit: Some folks have asked how much she’s paying for the wedding. We haven’t talked about it much, but she says she wants to contribute. She’s also mentioned a thing here or there that I’ll have to “get over,” like putting the flower girl (my baby sister) in burgundy so she’ll “pop out” when the color scheme is emerald and gold.

UPDATE: I called my fiancé when he got off work to vent to him a bit, and he’s just the best.

We need my mom, but this is a battle I can choose to lose. He even said that if these people come, we can come up with a code where he can come over and rescue me if I get trapped in an awkward moment. I can feel the bridezilla calming down. I’m still not thrilled, but at the end of the day, he’s right; if we want to afford our dream wedding, I’ll have to invite some people I don’t want to see. And then I can avoid them!

What did I pay for? A picture to be used for album artwork. A little over a year ago I found her art and contacted Jenny and commissioned the piece from her. She quoted me $180 and I sent it via cash app.

Fast forward 3 months and I reach out to her, eager to see where she was at with it but got no response.

So instead of d/m, I commented on work she posted where she was thanking the client for trusting her. “I trusted you and got nothing from it” was the comment I believe.

Suddenly, I’m blocked. 

All I wanted was a f*#%ing picture, that I overpaid for upfront and then got ghosted. Irate, I reach out to the tattoo shop she works out of and let them know she is a liability, and they should question her integrity.

I think I stopped breathing for a bit after I read that. The sheer arrogance alone was enough to make my jaw drop, but she went on to tell me she had already sent the art and perhaps i should check my junk mail.

For some context, I(24M) just had a fight with my mother(52F) this morning when I went to her apartment to help build the furniture for her dressing. My mother was a single mother for most of my life as my parents divorced when I was 5. I made another post last year on this sub about my father which wasn't involved in a lot of my life.

I was basically raised by my grandparents as my mother would work until pretty late and we never had a lot to say to each other. While she did provide for me financially, she was very absent for pretty much anything else. When I was 12, she became self-employed as a commercial and continued to work harder to reach a good standing. While I can't fault her for making this choice, it also meant that she was less available.

She also paid for my school tuition and my masters and was very much present financially which is why I do feel guilty for what happened. I got out of her apartment November last year after she yelled at me for working from home one day and I felt that we should take some space.

The dressing we were building is taking form in my old room, for which I have already gone to help her move the furniture somewhere else. Now that the context is out of the way, onto what happened.

I went there this morning to help her build the closets for the dressing, my uncle and aunt arrived just after me and me and my uncle started working the the dressing. An hour into building, I told my mother and uncle that I wanted to warp this up in one go, since I need to help my grandmother for her plants this afternoon (no hard time, just ""this afternoon""), to which my mother replied a rough French equivalent for ""Get the fuck out then"".

I didn't just up and leave at that moment only because my uncle hurt himself this week and I couldn't really let him do all the heavy lifting by himself. Fast forward 3 hours, we had the wardrobes built and some of them moved from her room to the dressing (reused furniture from her room for the dressing). My mother and aunt asked us for what we wanted to eat and I said ""I'm good, I'm going"". When asked why, told her that my mother wanted me to get out so I'm getting out.

Chaos ensues with my mother trying to say that this isn't how it went and trying to say that I told them I would not finish the work because I wanted to go to my grandma's. When I tried to say that this isn't what happened she kept talking over me again and again so I raised my voice and told her to let me finish my sentences.

Ensued us going back and forth with her telling that she is my mother and telling me ""Do you see how you talk to me ?"" and me telling her the same ""Do you se how YOU talk to me ?"" In the end the situation continued to escalate and she told me ""I've always me you my first concern, and now you always make me go after everyone else, I won't try to contact you go figure yourself out"".

So reddit, AITA ?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-16,"AITA for walking out on my mom when we were building up her dressing ? Hello all, sorry if there are any errors in the text, English is not my first language.

For some context, I(24M) just had a fight with my mother(52F) this morning when I went to her apartment to help build the furniture for her dressing. My mother was a single mother for most of my life as my parents divorced when I was 5. I made another post last year on this sub about my father which wasn't involved in a lot of my life.

31,1gsqwb7,AITA for telling on the students in my class?,"Hi, I am 16F, I am in HighSchool. This might be short so please help me out with this, I’m feeling anxious about it.

In my 5th period,  there are these kids who steal the candy, a lot. It’s not the first time they’ve done this and they’ve been doing it for a couple weeks now, they would orchestrate closing the door and running to go stealing the candy, while the other students hyped them up and even persuaded her to get more for them. This was going on for 3 weeks, I felt conflicted about it and feel bad for her because she’s spending 40$ on candy and people are stealing it.

Yesterday, on a Friday, it happened again and the teacher finally noticed. She opened her box and started to say that there was more candy than this and that she gave the students who stole 5 seconds to put the candy back- they put wrappers in the box. So she said she wasn’t giving the 5th period any candy anymore and she gave everyone a sticky note to write down what we saw. I wrote down what I saw and the girl (who is mainly responsible for all the stealing) was looking at what I was writing. She took it upon her self to grab a personal note from my back pack that fell and gave it to the teacher. I heard them talking about “who snitched?” “It’s not gaslighting if I do that though.” Which was after she gave my note to the teacher.

The teacher ended up pulling her outside the classroom and searching her pockets because I had written down what I saw and what happened. The girl who was stealing, took it upon herself to come in the classroom and publicly announce that; “Someone said I took a lot more candy and put in my backpack, I don’t know what they’re talking about.” Which is exactly what she said and what I saw, she took 2 handfuls of candy and put it in her backpack.

Another girl in my 5th period, who’s also in my 7th period came up to me and told me “you shouldn’t have snitched because now Ms. Teacher is going to write them up. I didn’t say anything and I knew who the people were aswell.”

I told my dad and step mom about the situation and they said that they shouldn’t be mad at me for telling the truth, and that she was the one who got herself in trouble and not me.

My mom said that what I did was dry snitching and to not do it again to avoid getting myself in trouble. I asked her “isn’t snitching when you’re telling on someone for something you yourself are also doing, to get yourself out of trouble?” She kept ignoring that part and just kept telling me to not do it again.

My sister said that even though I snitched, she would’ve done the same thing because I explained to her that the girl has been rude to the teacher several times before this and shouldn’t been stealing anyways. 

I need more perspectives on this, AITA.

EDIT: Hi, sorry, I should’ve have mentioned this earlier as one of the comments did point it out. I should’ve went to the teacher first before doing what I did and yes, I did do that.

A couple weeks ago they were stealing candy again and they had even made a grievance letter to try and get her fired, a lot of the students in the class had signed it and from what I remember, it was the girl who kept stealing candy. Saying that she was going to “make stuff up” to get her fired because the teacher was apparently making stuff up when she wrote her down for being disrespectful and Insubordinate.

 My best friends birthday is the first week in January which happens to also be the week of my anniversary with my partner.

I went ahead and booked a trip with my partner to utilize the two weeks of PTO since that’s half of my time off already used up till next summer. Now last week she turned the plans into one single day of dinner on the weekend after her birthday to celebrate.

33,1gsqlgg,WIBTAH if I give my friend an ultimatum?,"Throwaway.

My friend and I are looking to move in together once our leases are up. We've been roommates before with no real issues. The arrangement would be good financially for both of us, but I've had some mental health issues lately and in their worry, they are looking into places that would highly benefit me. This will come into play later.

Friend really wants a (large breed) puppy. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs, and a puppy would be fun. But I don't want to live with a puppy (of any size) right now. We already have three animals between us, and while they tolerate each other, they stress each other out. Housing will also already be hard enough to find with three animals without another large dog to include. And though they claim that the puppy will be their responsibility and I won't have to help, I don't feel that's entirely true - a puppy kind of turns into an entire house thing. If I don't want to live with messes or be a jerk to the poor dog, I will have to help care for it, and I can't handle that right now.

I've already said that I don't want to live with a puppy, but my friend keeps bringing it up, and recently sent a picture of it. They obviously very much want this dog, and I don't think it's fair to deny them this, especially when they're ready to give up some conveniences in order to make things easier for me. But I also don't think it's fair to make me live with a puppy that I don't have the spoons to spare for, and I do kinda think that there's a slight chance that I'd come home to find it in the living room.

At this point, I think that if they really want the puppy, it would be best if we don't move in together. I don't like ultimatums, and this feels like I'm making them choose between the puppy that would bring them joy, or me and cutting living costs.

34,1gsq9de,AITAH for cancelling a gathering with friends short notice becaus of my husband?,"For context:

My husband (28m) and I (28f) are together for nearly 12 years. He has a habit of answering properly and participating in the conversation but either not listening good or keep forgetting what was said. It’s exhausting because sometimes it happens and sometimes not, but you can’t determine which is which because he is participating in the conversation. It’s not a medical issue, we already checked that out!

The issue today:

We planed to have a gathering with Friends this evening. I talked WITH him about the things that needed to be done until our friends are coming over, because we wanted to eat together and the dining table needed to be prepared, we needed to clean the toilet (I always do this before guests are coming over) etc. Small cleaning things. 

About 30-45 minutes later I washed some dishes as WE TOGETHER planned I will do and he came asking some question about things we planned. When I said that we already planned that about half an our ago he can’t remember planing and did not know at all what we talked about. 

I got mad at him and said if he can’t remember what we planned it’s his fault and he needs to start writing things down. Then I told him I will do my part and if he doesn’t remember his I will not tell him. If his part isn’t done I will cancel. He tried to argue but seem to genuinely can’t remember, so I canceled the gathering. 

When I canceled it he got furious and told me I ruined his weekend and that I am an AH for canceling about that argument.

I feel a bit like the AH because he has no friends outside our gatherings in our country. He has 3 friends in other countries but they can’t visit quite often. He’s not a social person so it’s hard for him finding friends. I canceled the only friend gathering for him with our friendgroup this month. We planned this weeks beforehand. I feel awful for hurting him but I also feel good for putting my food down. It hurts that he can’t remember stuff I tell him and it feels like it’s not important what I say. It happened often and I feel like now is the end of the behavior without consequences.

Edit 1: because some had suggested it. We went to doctors and they said he does not have any kind of ADHD or Autism. 

Edit 2: to clear out more questions, we went to several doctors, psychologist and neurologist, we got done several psychological testings and medical testings, for example a MRI and CT of his brain. Yes he’s functional at work and yes he can remember many things he’s interested in. He has a good working memory regarding things he likes. I don’t think it’s weaponized incompetence because he does housework and does it right. I don’t need to clean after him. And the last point is, no they are not HIS friends they are OUR friends at OUR place and he did not do his portion of the housework so there was literally no space for 6 people to eat. We had documents and nerd stuff on the table that needed to be put away. Also my best friend was one of the invited friends and she said she wondered when something like this would happen because she knows the issue.

Edit 3: spelling 

Edit 4: many of you suggested whiteboards, sticky notes or apps and so on. We do have a whiteboard to write tasks on and we use different colors for the tasks depending on who it is assigned to. We also use an app called family wall which is a shared calendar and grocery list app, you can also make normal lists. It actually just didn’t cross my mind writing down like 3 tasks that we wanted to do 30 min. later. I also can be forgetful, mostly because I need to remember my stuff and my fathers stuff. I am my fathers legal guardian, so I need to remember his stuff too. I will talk about that topic with my husband again tomorrow.

35,1gspx8w,AITA for Sabotaging My Family in a Board Game?,"
Hi all, I(17f) was recently playing a board game called Ticket to Ride with my family. For those who don’t know, it’s a strategy game where players compete to build train routes on a map. You score points by completing routes from your destination cards and claiming railway segments, and you can also lose points if you don’t finish your routes by the end of the game.

Toward the end of our game, I realized that if I drew more cards to try to finish my routes, I’d probably lose points. So, instead of risking it, I decided to “sabotage” my family by claiming random train routes they might need. This didn’t break any rules—claiming any available route is allowed—but it frustrated my mom. She said the way I played wasn’t kind and accused me of being an asshole and even “cheating.” I told her I wasn’t cheating because everything I did was within the rules, and I thought of it as strategic gameplay.

For the record, I would never cheat in a board game because that ruins the fun for everyone. But I think any strategy that follows the rules is fair game.

So, AITA for sabotaging other players during the game, or is this just part of playing strategically?

Edit: hey all since a lot of you know the game i’m just going to explain it (we played the european edition). I finished my really long route worth 21 points so half of my trains were already gone. I had another route worth 12 points but my mom unintentionally blocked me when i almost finished it. I didn’t have enough trains to make another route so i just decided to block other people and then try and get the longest route possible for the 10 bonus points. Afterwards my mom claimed this was unfair and according to her i should have drawn another route even though that would almost certainly make me lose points because otherwise you’re just being annoying and rude. She also said that people can just complete one route and then annoy other people and that’s no fun. I told her that was weird because then you’d self sabotage and minimize your chances of winning. She told me that’s what she does when she plays and she could understand why I wouldn’t do that. Afterwards she just seemed upset. 

For those asking, yes, I play games to win and can get really into them. After reading a lot of the comments i’ve realized my parents probably play more for family bonding than competition. I also struggle with reading social cues, and sometimes my family gets cutthroat too. How do I figure out when to play nice versus when I can play to win? I love board games, and I think they do too, but I don’t want to ruin the vibe.

Afterwards my mom claimed this was unfair and according to her i should have drawn another route even though that would almost certainly make me lose points because otherwise you’re just being annoying and rude. She also said that people can just complete one route and then annoy other people and that’s no fun. I told her that was weird because then you’d self sabotage and minimize your chances of winning. She told me that’s what she does when she plays and she could understand why I wouldn’t do that. Afterwards she just seemed upset. 

For those asking, yes, I play games to win and can get really into them. After reading a lot of the comments i’ve realized my parents probably play more for family bonding than competition. I also struggle with reading social cues, and sometimes my family gets cutthroat too. How do I figure out when to play nice versus when I can play to win? I love board games, and I think they do too, but I don’t want to ruin the vibe.

It's a pretty regular Saturday morning routine to go out and walk together to get breakfast. 

Anyway, as we were getting ready to go he sees me take a book out of my bag of holding and set it on the table.  He says, ""did you have my book in your bag!!!?"" And I said yeah, ""I told you our daughter was reading it yesterday when we were out."" And he says, ""but I didn't know you put it in your bag!""

And I get it, he takes better care of books than I do in general, but I the book was fine.  He only knew it was in a bag because he saw me take it out, not because it was damaged.  Anyway, I explained why I had it and that it was fine, he was like I don't want it going in your bag, it was annoying, but whatever. 

So then I'm getting my shoes on to go for our walk and my dog comes up because he thinks he's going.  And I say, sorry dog, I'm going out with Mr grumpy pants this time, not you.  

To which my husband replies, ""No you're not.  I can't deal with you this morning.""

And... Now I'm sitting alone a few blocks away crying after storming out.  

I always really enjoy our walks and thought it was mutual and fuck if that statement that it was ""dealing with me"" didn't stick right in the gut. 

So who's the asshole? 

Edit:  I put his book in my bag because he had loaned it to our daughter who brought it along while she and I were out running errands yesterday. She asked if I could carry it in my bag.  I thought nothing of it.

37,1gsoseg,AITA - Wife booked a photoshoot with another photographer,"Short version, IATA!

**LONG VERSION:**

Despite currently not working as such professionally, I've done a lot of professional work as photographer and videographer for many years.

I have a camera and some studio lighting, but do not have a full studio setup because we live in an apartment. Still, I've made several shoots in the last 2 years with our baby (now 2yo) in the living room, his bedroom, and in the office, where I keep the equipment.

I do NOT have Christmas backgrounds, my sister has a couple, and also better equipment than I do, and space to setup a full studio on demand (usually she does corporative photography in the clients location).

Both our families live close to each other, 3h away, so we don't visit them as often as we'd like too.

My wife decided to book a Christmas family photoshoot, 1h away, without consulting me, because I don't have the scenario. It's just €100 for a 30min shoot, no big deal, but felt like betrayal to me! A decision I believe she shouldn't have made alone. For the same money we could have visited our family and have the photoshoot there, or could have bought decor and make the photoshoot my self without time constraints. But, mostly, she should have talked to me prior!

She, not only booked the photoshoot without even a word prior, but also thinks it's ""no big deal"", which pissed me even more!

38,1gsoqn7,AITA for being hurt by my best friend hanging out with people who disrespect me and not telling him?,"I (16M) am introverted so people at school dislike me, especially since I participate and ask questions in class, which most teens find ""teacher's pet behaviour"". I don't care about my classmates disliking me, but there is a group of them that my best friend (17M) is friends with and hangs out with on a regular basis. I'm happy for him, but the good part of this groups either dislikes or disrespects me.

My best friend, who we'll call John for clarity purposes told me about one of the girls, Emily, talking shit about me, going on a rant about how cringe and attention-seeking I am. All the while misgendering me and calling me by my deadname (I am transgender). I never talked to Emily, so I don't get why she hates me so much.
John did nothing about Emily saying all of this, which is okay, because I assume it was awkward. 

One of the girls, Charlie, has known about me being trans since last year. She is religious but still respected me. Yet, a month after the start of the school year, Charlie went up to me and told me she'd now call me by my last name and see me as genderless, rather than the boy I am. Of course, it's way better than calling me a girl and by my deadname, but I trusted her with this matter, so I feel betrayed in a way. John, who is close to her, told me that it was because she talked about it with another religious girl from my class, Nina (without asking me first if she could tell her), and that they came to the conclusion that seeing me as a boy would be a sin, which I don't understand, because it is their religion, not mine, so why should it affect me?

Before this, Nina was joking with John, saying that she is a very civil person, so she'll call me by whatever is on my civil status (the equivalent of an ID), basically saying that she'll call me by my deadname. John just laughed it off but still warned me because he knows that for my safety, it is better for me to know who is okay with my existence and who is not.

The thing is, John still hangs out with Nina, Emily and Charlie. He tells me all about what they do together and how much fun he has. I know he means well, and I told him not to choose his friends based on what I think of them, but I can't help but feel so hurt that he likes these people so much despite how they hurt me.
I'm scared that he'll someday decide that he likes them better than me or that he agrees with the bad things they said about me, and that he'll ditch me. I know it's silly, but I have a lot of trouble finding friends, and I am attached to him. I see him as a brother, and the idea of losing him scares me shitless.

39,1gsob34,AITA for MIL missing religious ceremony for my child,"I've removed gender as much as I can, apart from MIL.

Since the birth of my child earlier this year I have been trying to organise a particular religious ceremony for them. For various reasons (health, availability of me/my siblings, etc.) it has taken a while to organise. It's important to mention this because my MIL is under the impression I have just recently ""rushed"" to organise this without consulting her. This is my fault, since my partner isn't religious and isn't interested in anything to do with this ceremony, so I haven't been communicating this with them. This means they haven't been communicating this with MIL. So from my MIL's perspective it looks like she's an afterthought.

To the point - MIL has an overseas trip booked that overlaps with the date I've wrangled for the ceremony. In my defence - I didn't choose it, it was given. If I can't do it then, it isn't going to happen for many months. I am trying to be sympathetic to MIL, but I didn't think she'd be interested in being present for this ceremony. She isn't religious and neither is my partner so I didn't think she'd care. She chose not to perform this ceremony for my partner when they were born, so I'm confused as to why she wants to be present for the ceremony for her grandchild. Nevertheless, I'm doing my best to move the date but its looking futile.

My MIL is upset because she is probably going to miss this ceremony, but also because we didn't ask her before confirming the date. She is feeling left out and is upset because her trip has been booked for ""many months now"" and we didn't ask her what her availability was. I tried to tell her that we didn't pick the date, but it doesn't matter to her. For my feelings - she never mentioned this trip to me or my partner, not when she booked it or when I mentioned preparing for the ceremony. But admittedly I didn't ask her availability either, so you decide.

Based on other comments MIL's made, she doesn't understand the religious reasons why I want this ceremony to happen as soon as possible. She's not religious herself. But this ceremony has a real, profound reason behind it for me. There's a risk my child will die before ever experiencing this ceremony. The risk of death for my child is small, but they have an illness that increases risk of death as they age. It's why I want this ceremony to happen as soon as possible. My mother doesn't even need to be there. I just need one of my siblings, me, and my child. Those are the only people necessary for the ceremony to proceed.

My MIL is well aware of the illness my child suffers with, but has made comments in the past that have made me question whether she really understands how serious it is.

In Jan, my 3 friends & I booked our hotel after months of planning. The booking was under my name (important later), & we all paid our part of the deposit. A couple of weeks later, Casey (17F) asked if she could join us for two nights. She was having issues with her friends, so she came to us. I’m not super close to her, but I didn’t mind, & neither did the others. The plan was for her to bring her own air mattress. We didn’t check the hotel’s policy on extra guests (big mistake), & Casey hadn’t told us the nights she’d stay.

Now, fast forward to 2 or 3 weeks ago, Casey hates me. In March, I had a big, messy fight with Emma (one of the girls I’m staying with). We’re a little rocky but we’ve worked through it. But Casey still holds a grudge. She’s angry that I stayed close friends with someone Emma was also fighting with. Since around August, I’ve been hearing from others that Casey “hates” me & shit talks me most days, but to my face, she’s been civil.

Two or three weeks ago, while discussing our schoolies plans with another group and one of the girls I’m staying with, a friend asked if the hotel would be okay with a fifth person, given hotels are VERY strict in schoolies week. My friend & I texted the group if maybe it was best for Casey to come at the end of the trip. This was ok but after we checked the hotel’s policy, which seemed to allow only four people, she said she thought we had agreed on the first two nights. I checked, we hadn’t.

We called the hotel, & they said no extra guests were allowed. Casey wasn’t happy. She said we were “pushing her out” and “isolating” her. She didn’t respond much while we looked for solutions. A couple of days later, Casey sent a BIG text saying the solutions made her feel “uncomfortable & unsafe,” & that it had “a big impact” on her exam study. She didn’t want to talk about it anymore. We suggested day trips (the drive was 1.5 hours), but she didn’t reply. I was worried that maybe she was letting her hatred for me impact things since I felt like we were trying our hardest to accommodate her.

This week, after exams, I tried to be friendly, but Casey was cold. After graduation yesterday, I found out she had me for secret Santa. Turns out she planned to buy me “the worst gift possible"": fake, tacky earrings & dollarstore versions of everything on my wishlist. The budget is $30 fyi. She also suggested hosting the secret Santa at her house & inviting everyone but me.

This morning, I saw she blocked my Instagram, & the friend who encouraged her secret santa plans unfollowed me.

I’ve been thinking about all of this, & I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong. Casey told the others since the trip was booked in my name, I should have checked the hotel’s policy immediately & that it wasn’t her responsibility to check. So, she believes it’s my fault everything went wrong.

Today was my first day hanging out with them again, and it's safe to say none of them were exactly happy about it? I sat down at our usual table, and was ignored. Whenever I tried to make conversation, I was cut off. Then they started talking about a new group chat. I had asked if I would be added to it, and the girl who I am frankly the closest too says ""No, we thought it would just be for the main group, so you won't be in it."" And I got upset, though I tried not to show it. I don't hangout with them for a week, and suddenly I'm not even their friend anymore? So, AITAH for asking my friends to be in a group chat with them?",0.0,1.0382782,1,0

Im disgraphic) So in late marches I bought an Occulus meta-quest 2 with the money I was able to scrape by. It was pretty cool and attracted some attention mainly from my brother. Let's call him Dave.

Dave: That's a pretty cool thing.

Me: Yeah I bought it yesterday. I don't have any good games on it though. (I was broke after getting it)

Dave: Oh I know a cool game for it! I'll buy it for you if you can pay me back.

Me: sure. (Dave shows me the game and I like it)

About a week after he gets the game for me he asks to go on the VR. I tell him he can as long as the inner lenses don't get UV lights on them (it burns the membrane in them) he agrees and uses it. After about an hour I knock on his bedroom door to grab it so I can play with my friends. He says sure and grab it and put it on. And HOLY SHIT I WAS PISSED. It wasn't too bad just on the side bit i had specifically told him not to get sunlight on it. The argument went like this:

Mr: DUDE! I TOLD YOU NOT TO PUT IT IN SUNLIGHT!

Dave: I didn't!

Me: there is a fucking burn in my new vr! Do you really expect me to believe you? Should I even pay you for the game?

Dave: if you don't pay me back I will sell your stuff!

Me: fine! I'll give you half the money.

That's all of the argument that is relevant. I just don't know what to do and I'm at a genuine standstill. I'll post updates if I need to.

45,1gsmdm8,AITA For telling my half sister she doesn’t deserve my mom’s necklace? ,"Hello everyone, I'm coming on reddit to seek advice because I think I'm in the wrong. I 21F have 2 full siblings Michael, 23M and Damien 25M. We have a half sister Elsie 18F who is a result of an affair. 

Our mother 50M is unfortunately terminally ill, the doctors have told us she doesn't have much time left. SHe called us all in to talk about her will and what we would each be getting. My mother was a banker and amassed quite the portfolio. Shortly after Elise was born, her mother wasn't very active in her life, leaving her to move in with us and live with us. I could always tell mom held some sort of resentment to her, my mom wasn't strong enough to leave after the affair and she regrets it everyday. Mom raised Elsie like her own for so long, but all Elsie could do was be snarky towards her and always say ""but you're not my real mom"" of course she'd only say that when mom was trying to discipline her. But as soon as she needed something expensive she'd be as sweet as sugar towards mom. I avoided elsie growing up because I always felt like she ruined our picture perfect family.
 
Back to the day this happened, mom was reading out her will on her bed, my mother owns a beautiful emerald necklace; a family heirloom. She looks directly at Elsie and tells her she can keep it. I started crying immediately, it doesn't even make sense she's not entirely part of our family, her and mom share NO blood. I began to scream and yell at Elsie, I told her I wished she never walked into our lives, and that she should just leave because no one wanted her here. Damien tried to calm me down and reminded me we were in a hospital. Michael left the room with Elsie to avoid escalation. I saw mom crying and it kind of hurt but she hurt me worse. I grabbed my bag and left. It's been 3 days and I've gotten non stop messages from extending family saying I hurt my mom and she didn't mean any harm. AITA? 


Minor Update: 
Hi all, I have received some very well worded and thought out comments/dms. Just to answer some questions, the heirloom comes from my mom's side not dads. My father passed 2 years ago. Elsie's mom is a deadbeat to put it nicely. My brothers rarely speak to Elsie mainly due to them living 3 states away. I will be talking to my mom asap, she wants to talk and I want too as well because at the end of the day I love her and would never change that.

UPDATE: I visited mom and we had a really long talk about my life and growing up. I apologised to her and she accepted with a smile, she told me she'd always forgive me no matter what. That's why I love my mom she's a kind soul. I expressed to her that I felt I should have the necklace because we are blood and my grandma had it before, before her was my great grandma the x4. My mom started to tear up and explained that she thought I didn't want it and may as well pass it on to Elsie. 

She said she knows Elsie isn't her real daughter, but over the years her resentment turned to pity cause she really didn't have anyone, especially after I moved out to live with my boyfriend. Mom said we could call Elsie and come to an agreement. Mom called elsie and she actually came over to the hospital instead. She sat with us and I asked her what her plans are with the necklace. She told me she was gonna take really good care of it and wear it. 

I asked her if I could give her a portion of my current inheritance money as a way to buy it off her. E.g we both get $300,000 but I give her 25k, then she gets $325,0000 and I get $275,000 and the necklace. She said that was a good idea because I clearly have a connection to this necklace and she would benefit from liquid anyways.  Mom reassured her she would get other pieces of jewellery, my mom really loved bling. I feel happier knowing I could come to some sort of an agreement, but what's most important to me is that my mom and I are good and we are. I cried, told her I loved her and gave her a really big hug before I left. I said goodbye to Elsie and was on my way. 

I called Damien and Michael when I got home to explain what had happened, they said they were proud of me for reaching an agreement everyone was happy with. We talked a little more of the course of 2 hours and we agreed that whilst we don't want Elsie actively in our lives, we were gonna make sure she was set and Michael said we should check in on her when we can.

46,1gsmasy,AITA for asking for an expensive Christmas present?,"I, 18F, was looking at Christmas gifts to get for my parents online so that they would get here in time and wouldn't have to rush to stores and gwt overpriced goods. While I was looking for their gifts, I got sidetracked and visited a local kpop stores site just to look at what they had. 

I found out that they had a preorder going on (and it would only last about 8 more days) and found a limited version of an album that I had been eyeing for a WHILE. It was relatively expensive (about $55), but I thought that I could cover half the cost with pocket money I'd saved up and ask my dad to cover the other half as my Christmas present. I also showed him what I planned to order for my Mum as a joint gift between us. 
Now, here's the bit where I think I'm TA. While I was asking my dad about this, my mum walked in and got really mad about me asking him without consulting her (and yes, I knew she would have immediately said no if I asked her). 

She said I was being wasteful and should spend money on what I needed instead of wanted, and that I was being conniving by not asking her. I got pretty ticked of as well and asked her if I should spend my pocket money on toothpaste and shampoo instead of my interests. She said that I was wasting money and didn't know the value of it, especially since liking the band was ""just a phase"", and threatened to stop giving me pocket money because I would just waste it. She pointed out how I would spend on skincare but still had pretty bad acne as part of the issue. She also said that Christmas presents were meant to be a surprise, and not a request and shouldn't be that expensive.
Not wanting to make the situation any worse, I just left the room and tried to act normal for the rest of the day, but she's still very visibly upset and disappointed in me. I realise that asking for the album is really self indulgent, and could even be wasteful- but my justification is that it makes me happy. Its a gift that I actually would love to get instead of the surprise ones they've given me before (and, yes, I know it sounds really ungrateful but I'm not trying to be) like 2 books they'd gotten for me earlier or socks or a calendar. I just got really frustrated that my mum constantly thinks my interests are ""rubbish"" and is dismissive of them. 

However, looking back, I can see where her frustration is coming from. She's the breadwinner in our family and works really hard for the money. Spending so much of it on a gift is pretty wasteful, especially when we have a sick dog and 3 others in the house- doubly so without consulting her and essentially ""fooling"" my dad into getting it for me. I thought it would be OK if I paid for half, but I can see why it wouldn't. So, AITA? And should I just drop the subject entirely and apologise for being insensitive?

47,1gsm9ih,AITA for making my ex-wife pay me for a car seat,"Throwaway account as my BIL is active on Reddit. I (38M) split from my wife (39F) almost 3 months ago. We have two kids, and this post is about our son (5M). It wasn't the worst of break ups, but it definitely wasn't my choice to, and I hate how she went about it. We'd been struggling for a few years, and yeah, I admit I probably could've tried harder in couples therapy and stuff, but she basically up and left one day, saying she was tired of trying. Anyway, not to get too deep here, but basically, I think the way she left was fucked up. (This is relevant later.)

Since our son is so young, he still needs a car seat. When she left, she drove off with the car seat, leaving me without one for my son. I was pissed, and wanted it back, but she said that since she still is the one doing all the school drop offs and pick ups, I was out of luck, and passing it back and forth all the time meant she couldn't set boundaries with me. Whatever. So I had to go buy a new one so that I could spend time with my son, but what I didn't know is that at the same time, she asked her sister (my SIL), to give me her spare car seat. Her sister had a daughter who died unexpectedly a few years ago, when she was about 4. But I had already bought one, so I ended up with two car seats after her sister dropped it off when I wasn't home. 

A couple of weeks ago, my ex's car was broken into and everything was stolen, including the car seat she took. She texted me and asked me to drop off her niece's old car seat at our next handover. 

But I didn't think it was fair. She left me, she took the car seat, I didn't make her sister or her give me a free car seat, and now that her car seat was stolen, I didn't see why it was my problem. She also could've used her niece's old car seat when she first left, but she chose to take the one in the car. So I told her I would only bring it back if she paid me for it. Her sister gave it to me, so it's mine now, no one else. I told her she could buy it off me for $100 (it costs way more than that on the market), or she could buy another one on her own. She was pissed, but eventually sent me the money and I brought her the car seat. 

I thought this was fair and equal, considering what she did. But my ex-SIL, who I actually always liked and was sort of maintaining a relationship with, has stopped talking or texting me since this, saying that I'm out of line, and that if her daughter were alive today, she'd be disappointed in me. I really don't think I did anything unfair and was just maintaining the boundaries my ex asked for. It's also extra fucked, to me, that a dead girl is being used to shame me, when I did nothing wrong in the first place, and my ex is the one who got us here. So, AITA? 

Edit: ok, ok, I get it. I'm the asshole in this case. But she left me. She did this to herself. She's forcing me to put in the same boundaries she's insisting on. I don't get why people can't see this. Only one guy at work seems to understand how fucked up she is.

Now the problem occurs me and my bf at the time broke up - I paid him out the holiday so I have the tickets and the hotel etc all in my name and it’s now me going by myself. 

My mom is very old school and doesn’t like the idea of a girl travelling alone. So has recently messaged to insist she is happy to come even though “it will take her out of her comfort zone”. 

Now my concerns are - we’re both very different people so will want to explore NYC differently. We will have to share a room as it’s what I had booked. This is my dream trip where as she is only coming as she doesn’t want me to go alone so doesn’t really even want to be there which I feel will put a dampener on the hole trip. She will be a rush to get home as the day of return is only a day before her birthday which she already has plans for with my dad. 
I’ve also got into the mindset now that this will be my first ever solo trip and it feels right to do it by myself even though I’m nervous, I’ve looked into it and made sure to take all the safety precautions etc I do with every city I travel to but I also don’t want to upset her as I have wanted to do a girls trip with my mom but up until this point she’s always said “well your dad wanted to take me there or what will your dad do if I go away” so she’s never shown interest before so this trip feels she’s only doing it because she’s deemed it not safe enough not because she actually wants to come.

49,1gslohf,AITA for kicking my cousin out?,"My cousin (15F) and I(14F) were having a sleepover at my house. This was mid October and I hadn't seen her since September 1st I think, so obviously I wanted to spend time with her. Later that night I wanted to watch a movie with her but she opened a call with her online friend and started playing a game called Rec Room with him. After a while I told her to close the call so we could watch the movie and spend time together in general, but she refused. I just scrolled on TikTok and then went to sleep later on. The next day at around 6pm I told her that what she did brothered me because I wanted to spend time with her. Reasonable, right? She told me it's not a big deal and that when she was sleeping at our other cousin's house(13F), she didn't mind when my cousin(15F) was on her phone all the time. She also invalidated my feelings and said it's not a big deal. That genuinely pissed me off so I told her to pack her bag and leave. She went to our grandmother's house where she was originally staying for personal reasons, which is about 3 minutes away by walking. She texted me and apologized yet continued to say that me kicking her out wasn't the right thing to do but she ""forgives me"" as if my reaction wasn't based off of her making me feel like shit. I replied with a long paragraph talking about how when she was crying to me all bothered about some guy I was there for here and I gave her advice and comforted her but when I got bothered by something she did suddenly I'm the one who's taking it to heart and it's not that deep. I told her that I'm done and she didn't reply. I texted her at the end of October and told her that I've chosen to forgive her and I know she's going through a hard time but that doesn't give her an excuse to treat me like shit and we talked and we were good. Anyways it's mid November and she came over to sleep at my house again. She did the same thing last night. She was on a call with another guy for hours.

Am I really the asshole? I need answers, please and thank you.",No A-holes here,2024-11-16,"AITA for kicking my cousin out? My cousin (15F) and I(14F) were having a sleepover at my house. This was mid October and I hadn't seen her since September 1st I think, so obviously I wanted to spend time with her. Later that night I wanted to watch a movie with her but she opened a call with her online friend and started playing a game called Rec Room with him. After a while I told her to close the call so we could watch the movie and spend time together in general, but she refused. I just scrolled on TikTok and then went to sleep later on. The next day at around 6pm I told her that what she did brothered me because I wanted to spend time with her. Reasonable, right? She told me it's not a big deal and that when she was sleeping at our other cousin's house(13F), she didn't mind when my cousin(15F) was on her phone all the time. She also invalidated my feelings and said it's not a big deal. That genuinely pissed me off so I told her to pack her bag and leave. She went to our grandmother's house where she was originally staying for personal reasons, which is about 3 minutes away by walking. She texted me and apologized yet continued to say that me kicking her out wasn't the right thing to do but she ""forgives me"" as if my reaction wasn't based off of her making me feel like shit. I replied with a long paragraph talking about how when she was crying to me all bothered about some guy I was there for here and I gave her advice and comforted her but when I got bothered by something she did suddenly I'm the one who's taking it to heart and it's not that deep. I told her that I'm done and she didn't reply. I texted her at the end of October and told her that I've chosen to forgive her and I know she's going through a hard time but that doesn't give her an excuse to treat me like shit and we talked and we were good. Anyways it's mid November and she came over to sleep at my house again. She did the same thing last night. She was on a call with another guy for hours. I spoke to him at first too and everything but then I got bored and was just sitting there at some point not doing anything.

50,1gsllru,AITA for refusing to support my friend’s fitness influencer career because I think her vegan protein powder is trash?,"
I (26F) have a friend (24F) who decided to become a fitness influencer. She got into it because her now ex-boyfriend had a fitness business with a decent following. She joined his company and, although I was a bit doubtful about this whole endeavor in the beginning, she was doing incredibly well. She gained a lot of followers, and she even entered a bodybuilding competition and did great. I was really proud of her.

She was sponsored by the same brands that worked with her boyfriend because of her association with his company. Sadly, though, her boyfriend was a cheating piece of trash, so they broke up, and all her sponsorships dropped her because she was no longer under his brand umbrella. I honestly think this was so unfair, she was the image of the brand for months, and they just dropped her like that.

Fast forward to now, she’s been struggling but managed to land a sponsorship from a smaller, local supplement company in our home country. Problem is, I don’t live there anymore. I moved a while ago to the UK not long ago, and the brands she was previously sponsored by delivered here, but this one doesn’t. Her solution is that she wants me to order her supplements, ship them to my family back home, and then lug them back with me every time I visit, which, to be fair, is pretty often (every couple of months or so).


On top of that,, I only buy vegan protein powder. I hate whey. I’ve tried it—it’s straight up like licking a cow with a very slight hint of vanilla. So milky... and I HATE milk. It's also horrible in baking, which I love and do every single day, so I need it to be something I actually like/can work with. All of this to say I never understood why people say vegan protein powder sucks, both the previous brand and the one I get are amazing. Well, now I do. The brand she’s sponsored by is awful, like truly an undrinkable chalky mess, even in shakes, and it’s also way more expensive.

I tried explaining this to her, but she keeps bringing it up and guilt-tripping me about how she’s struggling right now and really needs my support. I get that she’s having a hard time, but the hassle of doing this every two months (planning the deliveries, dealing with shipping costs, cramming extra tubs of powder into my already full luggage, or worse, paying extra for baggage) just seems like too much.

She’s one of my best friends, and part of me wonders if I should just suck it up and do it. But at the same time, this would impact me because, like I said, I eat this stuff every single day, and I love my food...And I'm also not in the best financial situation, but reallistically it would be 10 more euros a month...(if I don't have to pay for extra luggage). 

So, AITA for saying no?

53,1gsl4ca,WIBTAH for just leaving the mall where me and my bestfriend were supposed to meet up?,"I (25F) have been bestfriends with Sam (25M) for 6 years now. We met in senior high and got along pretty well immediately. Aside from having the same sense of humor and (i guess) intellect, we mostly have the same principles and povs. We’re not really the type that messages or calls often, but we do hit each other up whenever the tea is just too juicy. We’d also send each other reels or shorts, but aside from that, we meet up seldomly. 

We used to live around 20-30mins away from each other before. When I graduated college and took a gap year, and he continued his studies, he moved to a place near his university which was around an hour and a half away from me. I would typically drive or commute to where he stays, since there’s a mall right below his place. Me and some of our other friends would do this as well - go to where he is. We are all aware of how busy and stressed he is + he doesnt really like going places that are far from his place, which is why we just opt to go to him.

Now, we are at a point in our lives where catching up with each other has been very difficult. Not much calls/chats, and setting a common date to go out is almost impossible. So last month, we established that we would go out for dinner this November, most likely on a weekend after his defense. That’s today.

I’ve been sitting in a cafe waiting for him. I’ve rang his phone and messenger several times already, but it’s of no use.

I’m just feeling so bad right now. I want to get mad at him, but I do understand that he’s tired with school and all. But I’m tired too. And yet I still drove for hours (weekend christmas traffic), just to meet up with him. Im contemplating if I should still try to ring his phone to wake him up or just stop and go home. If I just wait for him, I wouldnt want him to feel guilty for falling asleep. If I leave, I wouldnt want him to feel guilty for making me go to him then just leave.

So, WIBTAH for leaving now without waiting for my best friend?


UPDATE: He woke up

Thank you for all your comments. It made me feel at ease with the emotions I was starting to build up.

To answer some questions for more context:
- We were first deciding if we should meet yesterday (friday) or today (sat). He was the one who said that he’d be free this afternoon
- I told him I’d be at the mall between 4 to 5pm because I’ll be coming from my dentist. I updated him again when I was leaving the dentist that it would take me 25mins to get there, and that I’ll call hin when im near
- His condo is literally above the mall we were going to meet at. So.. traffic is not a problem
- Where we live, the Christmas season starts early (“ber” months)
- I arrived the mall around 4:55PM and was able to park by 5:20PM. I made the post by 7:15-ish. He called at 7:19PM saying “whereareyou whereareyou i’ll go there” HAHAH

This is a throw away account cuz I know many people on reddit. Hi! I (17 female) live with my brother (18 male) and father (44 male). Me and my brother never had a strong bond we were just two people forced to live together basically, sure we got along well enough but that was the extent of it. When I was 15 and my brother was 16 our mother died and I was forced into therapy but my brother flat out refused so they eventually stopped trying to make him. This resulted in him locking himself up in his room playing video games 24/7. We went on with our lives and grew further apart. Recently (for the past 6-8 months) he's been very angry and ""aggressive"". And I'm not sure what to do about it, I tried talking to him about it and asking him why he is acting the way he does and to that he says things like ""because you're annoying"" and gets more ""aggressive"". He only really does things when we're home alone so if I am to tired to deal with his BS I'll lock myself in the bathroom. Still I don't think it's right that I should be scared to walk around in my own house when he is home. My plan is to leave to go to an exchange student program next year and hope that he gets better while I'm gone. I've talked to people in my family about leaving. I didn't think it would be a problem, but to my surprise everyone seemed to have a problem with it, telling me that my brother has been through alot (even though we've been through the exact same things) and that I can't just move away from my family because of him, they also said that they wouldn't pay for me to do an exchange student program and essentially that my education was a waste of money. I told them that it was my decision and that I had the money to pay for myself. But now they all seem mad at me and I'm not sure what to do.
To clarify I've been wanting to do an exchange student program since I was 11 and my friend's sister went to America to be an exchange student. I don't want to do an exchange student program to get away from my brother but that is what has gotten me through the past months. If he did anything I would think it's fine I only have to deal with him for another year. 
I think the reason why my family is reacting is because I was talking about how exited i was about going to the uk to study and ""plus I'll get a year away from my brother"" might hve slipped out.

I’m worried this will affect my relationship with my boyfriend as he’s abit of a social butterfly (or just a normal socialising person) and has a big family. 

It’s not my boyfriend that’s the problem since I have always been like this in other relationships. I have no problem going out with him on a date or in public and love spending time with him but when it comes to weddings, other people’s birthdays or his family events or even dinner’s I just have a feeling of dread and do not want go through it. I’m aware this comes across as selfish or rude but I just sometimes wish I could avoid the pressure of those situations and skip them. 

I’m not wanting to isolate him from his family or take him away from those events, I just simply don’t want to go. It’s nothing against his family and they’ve done nothing wrong (I’m the same with other partners I’ve had).

I do have ADHD so not sure if some of that explains itself with poor self esteem and feeling exhausted masking or overthinking every interaction. I genuinely like to be alone and if I have a partner I’m comfortable with them but otherwise socially awkward. But while I want to be able to be ‘normal’, I’m not  that way inclined and don’t want to pretend I’m not awkward since I don’t have the want to be in those social situations anyway and don’t like faking things or pretending I’m happy to be somewhere that I’m not.

56,1gskn6g,WIBTA If I rehomed my sister’s reptiles?,"So for some context, a few months ago my sister and BIL got evicted from their apartment. Things were quite tragic and I was helping them out financially and with labor where I could. Well while I’m helping them move my sister asks me if I could watch her reptiles for a while. Initially I was hesitant because my apartment doesn’t allow me to have pets and I’m looking at moving into college dorms in January. So I told her if she can’t find someone else to take care of them I can for a little while. The first two weeks were decent in terms of communication, but eventually she stopped asking about the reptiles and she stopped responding to any updates. So now we’re in November and I’m starting to get stressed that she won’t find a place for them. I started venting to my friends about this situation and my buddy really wants the geckos. So, for the past week I’ve been calling and texting my sister and BIL everyday trying to communicate and they’ve been ignoring me. I’m on the fence because I know my sister is emotionally attached to the reptiles (the geckos for example were an anniversary gift from my BIL) but I cannot provide for the reptiles much longer.

Update: She got ahold of me finally responded back on Snapchat 

S: Don’t be getting ride of them unless u absolutely have to bc me n [BIL] won’t have out own place till around the 22nd of January

Is it fair that I get screwed over for helping you out?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-16,"WIBTA If I rehomed my sister’s reptiles? So for some context, a few months ago my sister and BIL got evicted from their apartment. Things were quite tragic and I was helping them out financially and with labor where I could. Well while I’m helping them move my sister asks me if I could watch her reptiles for a while. Initially I was hesitant because my apartment doesn’t allow me to have pets and I’m looking at moving into college dorms in January. So I told her if she can’t find someone else to take care of them I can for a little while. The first two weeks were decent in terms of communication, but eventually she stopped asking about the reptiles and she stopped responding to any updates. So now we’re in November and I’m starting to get stressed that she won’t find a place for them. I started venting to my friends about this situation and my buddy really wants the geckos. So, for the past week I’ve been calling and texting my sister and BIL everyday trying to communicate and they’ve been ignoring me. I’m on the fence because I know my sister is emotionally attached to the reptiles (the geckos for example were an anniversary gift from my BIL) but I cannot provide for the reptiles much longer. AITA

Update: She got ahold of me finally responded back on Snapchat 

S: Don’t be getting ride of them unless u absolutely have to bc me n [BIL] won’t have out own place till around the 22nd of January

We have 2 kiddos together and he is such an amazing partner and the best dad. We have great communication and I feel like I should be able to tell him how I feel but I don't want to hurt his feelings. 

He has been asking about my ring size and the difference between the stones. I assumed he had been planning on purchasing a ring/already purchased one. Well long story short I found the ring order with the details and I do not like it. When he was asking me about ring sizes and stuff I went online and designed one just to show him what would be my dream ring. In the past I've mentioned that I like Moissanite because natural diamonds are pricey for what you're getting. However we never really spoke about lab created diamonds. 

The ring he purchased is a moissanite ring. However it's not exactly what I wanted. I like a ring with side stones and this one does not have side stones. It's your standard 6 prong cushion solitaire. Nothing to ooo or ahhh about. The ring I designed is a beautiful cathedral 4 prong vintage ring with side stones. It really screams me. It's lab created diamond and within budget. We spoke about what the ring budget would be and it was 3k. I've never been the type to need an expensive ring. I think $500 is expensive for jewelry. 

Should I tell him before he proposes? Or just be grateful he got me a ring.

We all seem to get along well and I love the area. This whole time I've tried hard not to cause any issues.I try to be as invisible as possible. I work night shift and the rest of the house typically works days. I leave for work around 12:30/1pm and get home anytime from 1am - 4am. We have a driveway and garage. The neighborhood has street parking as well. All of us have a single car except one person. They have multiple cars. Most of the time they keep a majority of their cars in the garage and driveway. Only one or two will be on the street. Normally, that doesn't bother me as I still have one or two spots open to me. The issue is when they park all except one of these cars on the street. That means I have to park at the opposite end of our road and walk back 15 houses to ours. For reference, the distance from my house to the end of the road as is a 1/3 of a mile. Typically, it doesn't bother me. However, lately (the past several weeks) I come home after a 12 or 13 hour shift at 3am. It is dark and the street doesn't have much light. Additionally, we have gotten multiple warnings about coyotes being seen in the area. Truthfully, I don't feel safe walking that far at 3am with just my phone flash light. Tonight, all but one of their cars were on the street in front of the house. I thought maybe this roommate was still out and I didn't want to get blocked in if I parked in the driveway. I tried to contact them to ask if I could park in the driveway. After circling the block for 35 minutes and no reply I parked in the driveway. I took my things inside and checked the garage, sure enough the unaccounted for car was inside.  That means all cars are accounted for. So, after sending a second message telling them I parked in the driveway blocking the car in the garage I went to bed. I don't want to be an AH but how many times asking for consideration with the parking situation do I take action? Sure I could park my car 15 houses away, but this is my house too. I feel like I've tried to be reasonable and communicated what I need to park near my house. The last time I brought it up I was told at 10pm that there was tons of open parking. I still had 4 more hours until I could get home from work. When I did there was no parking near my house and I had to walk. So, AITAH?

I have periods where I have uncontrollable head and arm movements, and I also have vocal tics, which include gasping, but can also be random words or even short sentences. I have no control over these, but it tends to have periods that are worse, and others where there are only a few gasping noises and head jerks and thats all. I do not attend mass in person when I am bad, but will go when I have milder tics, which has been tolerated reasonably well in the past. Today, I went to a church I have been going to for years, where the majority of people pretend they don't notice, but tonight someone I hadn't seen before sat in front of me by herself just as the mass was beginning. Just after the first prayer, I did a small gasp, and said sorry out loud for any people listening. The woman in from of me turned her head, and glared at me like I had made the sound on purpose. I couldn't say any thing as we were in the middle of mass. I became so self conscious about my tics that they got worse, and I ended up leaving early and waiting for my family in the car. I appreciate that the woman may have been surprised by my tic, but I felt it was really out of line to turn around completely to face me and give me a dirty look. I admit I didn't feel in the spirit of my faith at the time, because it is people like this woman who make my life harder in general. I feel like I want to speak to the priest and ask him to make an announcement in church to advise the congregation that there is a person with a medical condition here today and that she sometimes makes noises that she is unable to control and to ask if people could refrain from staring at her. Is that being being petty? Would I be the AH for asking the priest to speak up on my behalf, instead of speaking to this woman directly after church? I don't know her and I don't feel comfortable approaching someone who has already been rude to me.

It’s seems the consensus is best not to bounce in church, but a few people gave me the idea of getting a hidden disability card to ask for their patience.

62,1gsispm,AITA for deliberately taking up space in the dorm to make my presence known,"I F(19) am the RA to three girls Sam (F19), Kelly (18), and Alex (18). 

We all agreed we weren't gonna decorate the dorm when we first moved in so the place is mostly barren. Only Sam cared and arranged things few things we had the way she liked. This led to her replacing my items like my shower curtain, bathmat, trashcan and replacing it with her own things. She also moves my kitchen items out of the way like my soysauce or water kettle without telling me because they don't 'look nice'.

Sam also finds fault in a lot of my cleaning habits, so I am extremely careful about cleaning up after myself. I sweep my hair off the floor, I clean the kitchen thoroughly after cooking, I wipe the sinks down if they get wet. I am the only one who takes the trash out. I don't leave dishes in the sink. Yet, she always finds something wrong like she's actively trying to erase any trace of me from the dorm. 

She also tries to get me fired often, tattling on me to my boss when I tried to get her to sign a blank contract which I didn't have at the time we did our roommate agreement so I wrote the notes down and was going to transpose them on the paper after everyone signed and turn it in.

Another time, the upstairs neighbors were being loud and she told me to tell them to quiet down. I do and explain to her that they're fixing their bed and to wait to which she storms out and tells her boyfriend (also an RA) to threaten to report them for alcohol even though he lives with people who drink too. He's also yelled 'shut the hell up' to other residents before.

The last time was because of her bath mat. Sometimes the bathmat gets wet, and so I will spend an extra 5-10 minutes making sure the magnets are in place or the shower angle is tilted away to avoid this. I hadn't gotten it wet in a while, but it happened again and she brought it up the group chat for the third time saying she's 'worried about mold' to which I passive aggressively replied I am actively trying not to get the bathmat soaked, but I can't always be hyperviligant about it.

The next time I'm at work, she gets my boss to do a mediation and tells her how I was rude and that I don't help that much in cleaning but doesn't bring up the other two roommates not cleaning at all. She then brings up how I had mold under my shampoo bottles (it was mildew) and asks if I was 'mentally okay'. 

The mediation ends and I'm looking up whiteboards to create a cleaning chart when I come up with an idea. 

Since she's trying to erase my existence, why not make my presence apparent. I blast my wallet and I spend $250 on dorm decor: welcome mats, table cloths, couch cover, etc. And I make sure they go against her 'aesthetic' idea of a dorm.

Now, as my stuff ships, I keep wondering if I'm actually an unclean roommate and bad at my job. My other roommates don't have a problem with me and my roommates from last year never had an issue with me.

so like me and my freindship group are in secondary school and we are all girls and my group is a group of 4 with sometimes 4 others who hang out with us who aren’t really in the group, one of thoes 4 others called Stephanie who no one likes and she does not like us either because of some drama that happened and she did some rlly horrible things but she still sits with our group at lunch and in the main 4 that i think im in, there are 3 other girls called zoe maya and alex, who are way closer to each other because they have all been a trio since 3 years ago and zoe and maya knew each other scince they where babies but compared to me who joined a couple months ago. 

When i joined i was already acquaintances with maya and alex, when i tried to be friends with zoe she would always air me for some reason but i left it but now zoe is really starting to get on my nerves over the span of these couple of months. First when i joined the group we were talking about interests and i said i liked anime and mangas because i really enjoy them and zoe told me that she never would of thought that and i asked her why and then she replied with “because your like black and i never see black people watching anime bc they usually like top boy (wich is a show with black road men) or something.” And she would always make snide racist remarks and when id call her out for it she would start hugging me saying “you know i love you and im just joking.” She said it in a way were she wasn’t serious and was making me look like i was being dramatic. Another thing that annoys me is her weird fetishisation of korean men she has stated to me and our group with no shame her fantasies of being korean and how she wishes she was korean to marry a kpop idol. And for some reason she kept defending the girl Stephanie that we fell out with wich i find really weird and when i joined the group she would keep saying it was a trio and not include me for some reason and she was telling everyone about how everyone could go to her house so she invited the whole group including Stephanie to her house but not me even though i always arrive at every meet up then the next day at school she would mention it the whole time and thoes times that i do meet up with zoe i have to ask her but she seems really uninterested and that she doesn’t want to go and when we go she never posts me on her story even though she posts all her other friends on there and shes done more weird things but i cant be asked to type it all out. 

And so i told some of my friends who aren’t in our group and they agreed with me that shes weird and so we had been talking bad about her but now im feeling guilty because texted me that she loves me and that im her bsf and now i feel like an a-hole, am i the a-hole?",TL;DR,2024-11-16,"AITA for talking bad about my ‘friend’

First when i joined the group we were talking about interests and i said i liked anime and mangas because i really enjoy them and zoe told me that she never would of thought that and i asked her why and then she replied with “because your like black and i never see black people watching anime bc they usually like top boy (wich is a show with black road men) or something.” And she would always make snide racist remarks and when id call her out for it she would start hugging me saying “you know i love you and im just joking.” She said it in a way were she wasn’t serious and was making me look like i was being dramatic. Another thing that annoys me is her weird fetishisation of korean men she has stated to me and our group with no shame her fantasies of being korean and how she wishes she was korean to marry a kpop idol. And for some reason she kept defending the girl Stephanie that we fell out with wich i find really weird and when i joined the group she would keep saying it was a trio and not include me for some reason and she was telling everyone about how everyone could go to her house so she invited the whole group including Stephanie to her house but not me even though i always arrive at every meet up then the next day at school she would mention it the whole time and thoes times that i do meet up with zoe i have to ask her but she seems really uninterested and that she doesn’t want to go and when we go she never posts me on her story even though she posts all her other friends on there and shes done more weird things but i cant be asked to type it all out. 

And so i told some of my friends who aren’t in our group and they agreed with me that shes weird and so we had been talking bad about her but now im feeling guilty because texted me that she loves me and that im her bsf and now i feel like an a-hole, am i the a-hole?",,0.077826545,0,0

I am not close with either roommate, and the only reason we live together is because a mutual friend helped us both get connected. I didn't have a place to rent for the semester, and neither did they.

Over the past month, the roommates Alex and Connor, have had overnight guests 3 times so far.

67,1gsi9pi,AITA for preventing my best friend from being with a potential partner? ,"
Hi, I’m Sophie (24, cisw). Two months ago, I invited my best friend Max (24, he/him) to a party I was hosting (not at home). Max and I have been friends for over a decade—he’s like family to me. We’ve been through a lot together: high school, college and now our professional lives. We’ve always been there for each other, especially when it comes to relationships.

 I’ve been single for a while, and it’s always been difficult for me to make romantic relationships work. Recently, I developed feelings for Ale (22, they/them), someone I met in my new city. I told them about my crush, and Ale admitted they liked me too but wanted to stay friends. Though I wanted a relationship, I agreed because our friendship was more important to me. I’ve tried to move on, but it hasn’t been easy. I’ve tried dated other people, but nothing compares to the connection I had with Ale. 

On the day of the party, Max knew all of this. Ale showed up, and I introduced them. They seemed to get along well, which made me happy at first. Later I saw Max hold Ale’s hand, and by the end of the night, I found them kissing. They know I saw them. We all went back to my place,cause we agree prior to the kiss that the 2 would stay over for safety reasons.  
I was rude and kept throwing indirect comments during the entire walk home with Ale and Max. I didn’t confront them directly, but I was cold and harsh with both of them, even though Ale wasn’t at fault. I was so hurt and angry that I took it out both of them.

We slept in my bed together, which felt uncomfortable given the situation but was that or the floor. Ale went home first thing in the morning, after Ale left, Max apologized, blaming the alcohol (though none of us were drunk). I was rude about it, being angry and cold, not giving him a chance to explain. I told him the issue wasn’t the kiss itself but that he’d chosen to kiss Ale knowing how much it would hurt me. He promised not to pursue anything further with Ale, but a week later, I found out they were still in contact. They had even met up. When I confronted Max, he claimed it wasn’t romantic. But bro wtf.

This situation has left me questioning everything. Max and I have been friends for so long, and he’s always known how hard it is for me to buid relationships but I also know is hard for him too. But his actions felt like he prioritized his feelings for someone he just met over our 10 year friendship. Part of me feels like I’m being selfish for not letting Max explore a potential relationship, but at the same time, it feels like a huge betrayal. I know Ale doesn’t owe me anything.

Am I being selfish for not letting Max pursue Ale? Is it unreasonable to be upset about a kiss?

I hold a lot of resentment over the fact that she deprived him of his father and that she is generally narcissistic and manipulates her way into things, to the point where my husband lets her have her way because he yearns for that acceptance and is afraid of upsetting her or making her feel like “she doesn’t matter.” Yet, she has never prioritized our family. My husband has tried to invite her to go places or see a movie a few times before and she always says no, yet she’ll go with friends. Her dog and other things seem to be more important than us. She threatened to not come to our wedding over a minor tiff with my husband, which was very hurtful to me. She complains about being “left out” of everything even though she never makes any effort to host or invite us to anything or to spend time with us (only comes for a short period to see grandkids - on her own schedule, with very little flexibility even though she’s retired).

69,1gshzk1,AITA for making sure I take up space and make my presence known in my shared dorm ,"Pretty long thread. If any of the participants see these, oh well.  I (F19) am rooming with three other girls S (F19), K (F18), and A (F18). Me and S are both sophomores and the other two are freshmen. I work with housing and am an RA, so I didn’t have a say in who I lived with which I was okay with.

Before we met, I created a group chat and we basically all agreed we weren’t really gonna decorate the dorm. I was fine with living without any extra things. It didn’t matter to me how the dorm looked or whatever I just lived there.

On the other hand, S did care a bit more and decided to rearrange things the way she liked, adding a carpet and a painting and moving some of the kitchen appliances in a neat way. I did not have a problem with that until she started changing my things that I had brought from moving in first.

It started off small like she said the bathmat I bought got wet too easily and changed it with her green one. Then the cute floral shower curtain I had was replaced with her own. Then the trashcan I bought for the bathroom was also replaced by a different trashcan.

I didn’t say a single thing, but it didn’t end there.

S likes to move things away that aren’t aesthetic enough to her taste. I usually use a water kettle and there are only two plugs one for the microwave and the other she has plugged into her coffee maker which she doesn’t always use. Sometimes I’ll have my water kettle plugged in, and by morning it is underneath the sink. My other roommates toaster also succumbed to that fate, but she wasn’t bothered by it.

Also, I have a jar of honey and soy sauce I like to keep on the dinner table. I kept it next to her salt and pepper shaker, and shocker, it’s not on the table anymore it’s in my cabinet. This happened multiple times before I just gave up. I also had two little toys I had on the dinner table for decoration but those also found themselves in a drawer which I wasn’t too sad about but still bothered me.

All of these things I was okay with dealing with. I don’t care how my dorm looks. It's just a dorm, but then she began to complain about me.

She told me that she hates that I shed. Which I do too. So I spent extra time cleaning my hair from spaces when I see it. She doesn’t like when there is food in the sink which is also valid, so I make sure when I cook I don’t ever let there be any food in the filter. I wipe down every surface before I’m done. I overheard her complain about the rim of the sink always being wet, so I started drying it when I used it.

All of these things were reasonable in theory, but somehow only I seemed to be the one creating these issues even when K or A were the ones to do it. She never ever brought up anything anyone else did like how A would leave rotted food in the fridge or how people slammed the doors or how no one else did their part of the cleaning.

It truly felt like she was trying to get rid of any trace of my existence.

And it especially became worse when she started targeting my job and trying to get me fired.

The first incident was a small thing. For my job, we had to have discussions with our roommates about the way we would live together. I didn’t have the contract on hand so we all agreed to discuss the questions and I would write down the answers on my phone. After I got the paper, I asked everyone to sign it so I could rewrite our conversation notes down and I could turn it in. S says she doesn’t feel comfortable doing this, maybe because she felt like I would alter the answers, and so I write it all down and then ask everyone to sign and tell them to let me know if they change anything. She then proceeds to alter an answer and not tell me which I bring up by text.

The next time I have a meeting with my boss, this incident is brought up, and I am confused because there is no way she would know unless S tattled on me or her boyfriend who is a coworker did. My boss is understanding and tells me to not do it next time.

The second incident was when the upstairs neighbors were being loud. S told me they were moving furniture after quiet hours, so I went upstairs and told them to quiet down. The one at the door explained to me that her roommate was just fixing her bed after they had made a bed fort. I say okay and to quiet down then I explain that to S, and then I write a noise complaint report.

Not even ten minutes later, she storms out of the dorm and gets her boyfriend to tell them to quiet down and he threatens to have them written up for alcohol because he claims he heard bottles even though he lives with people who consistently drink. Also, this wasn't the first time he had yelled at residents (we live in a freshmen only dorm) and had yelled at residents once to 'shut the hell up'. 

There are so many violations I could bring up about her boyfriend too, but I'm not going to bring those up. But I will say, that I have never snitched on him like she has about me.

The last time was the final straw.

At this point, I know she hates my guts. She is openly dismissive of my attempts at greeting her. She ignored me in public when I said hi to her, literally snatching her food and running away. And I’ve heard her openly badmouthing me to the other roommates. Also, I know she is applying for the RA position, and it's obvious she thinks she would be the better RA at this point. 

Unrelated, but I overheard her say that she would use her boyfriend's twin, also an RA, to interview with and get a guaranteed job position.

The ultimate final straw was that she also hates the fact that I get her bathmat wet.

It’s been a regular issue for me for some reason, but I know my other roommate A has had this issue at least once before because I've seen the bathmat hanging.

I’ve spent an extra 5-10 minutes every shower making sure the curtain is shut correctly or the tilt of the shower head isn’t facing the curtain or the magnets are stuck in place. Or I would spend that time cleaning up the bathroom floor and soaking up the water with my own towel before stepping out.

In the latter circumstances, I would hang her bathmat to dry then go about my day.

She’s brought up the bath mat situation three times, and each time I tell her that I am actively trying not to get it wet. 

I hadn’t for a while until recently when I got it wet again.

When she brings this up, I’m rolling my eyes at this point because what else can I do? I won’t lie. I was passive aggressive in the way I told her that I can’t do anything about it at this point and that I don't always have the energy to be hypervigilant about water getting out all the time. While she feigns innocence by saying she cares about mold in the dorm which I say won't happen because I have to check for it in my job. And she is livid.

The next time I’m at work, she’s there with my boss because we’re now having a surprise mediation. She brings up the bath mat situation and already I’m done with it. She talks about how she deep cleaned the dorm yesterday and how I’m not helping as much but doesn’t bring up that the other two roommates don’t even clean at all.

She brings up how I sounded rude to her through text and then brings up that she is ‘only concerned about the bathroom growing mold’ and brings up that under my shampoo bottles there was mold. I later checked with maintenance and they said it was just mildew. Then, to top it all off, she asks if I am ‘mentally okay’.

I do all my dishes. I sweep all my hair. I clean the kitchen countertops. I never leave trash anywhere. I take out the trash. If you stepped into the dorm, it would look like nobody lived there at first. It. Was. Not. Enough.

We finish the mediation, and we come to the conclusion that we will use a cleaning schedule from now on, and I suggested I use my own bathmat from here out.

Having been stressed out from other things, I end up crying in front of my boss after S leaves and pretty much solidify my 'mentally unwell' state in her mind.

I am looking depressed, scrolling online for a whiteboard for the cleaning schedule, when an idea comes to me. Everyday, my existence is slowly being erased by her perfectionist idea of a dorm, why not take up more space?

So I blast my wallet into pieces and spend $250 on dorm decorations. A welcome mat, table cloth, shower caddy, cute hand towels, couch covers and pillows. And I chose designs that did not match her aesthetic at all. They were all cutesy concepts, nothing minimalistic.

I plan to switch out my shower curtain as well and maybe even bring my mini trashcan back.

Now, I am waiting for them all to come, but I still can’t help but think am I actually the delusional one? Am I actually an uncleanly roommate who is just bad at her job? I've lived with people before and they never brought up any of the issues S has brought.

So reddit, really just let me have it. Am I the asshole for going through with this plan of taking up space and living the way I do?

Tl;dr roommate tries to erase my existence and get me fired, and I buy things to make my presence known",TL;DR,2024-11-16,"AITA for making sure I take up space and make my presence known in my shared dorm  Pretty long thread. If any of the participants see these, oh well.  I (F19) am rooming with three other girls S (F19), K (F18), and A (F18). Me and S are both sophomores and the other two are freshmen. I work with housing and am an RA, so I didn’t have a say in who I lived with which I was okay with.

Before we met, I created a group chat and we basically all agreed we weren’t really gonna decorate the dorm. I was fine with living without any extra things. It didn’t matter to me how the dorm looked or whatever I just lived there.

On the other hand, S did care a bit more and decided to rearrange things the way she liked, adding a carpet and a painting and moving some of the kitchen appliances in a neat way. I did not have a problem with that until she started changing my things that I had brought from moving in first.

It started off small like she said the bathmat I bought got wet too easily and changed it with her green one. Then the cute floral shower curtain I had was replaced with her own. Then the trashcan I bought for the bathroom was also replaced by a different trashcan.

I didn’t say a single thing, but it didn’t end there.

S likes to move things away that aren’t aesthetic enough to her taste. I usually use a water kettle and there are only two plugs one for the microwave and the other she has plugged into her coffee maker which she doesn’t always use. Sometimes I’ll have my water kettle plugged in, and by morning it is underneath the sink. My other roommates toaster also succumbed to that fate, but she wasn’t bothered by it.

Also, I have a jar of honey and soy sauce I like to keep on the dinner table. I kept it next to her salt and pepper shaker, and shocker, it’s not on the table anymore it’s in my cabinet. This happened multiple times before I just gave up. I also had two little toys I had on the dinner table for decoration but those also found themselves in a drawer which I wasn’t too sad about but still bothered me.

All of these things I was okay with dealing with. I don’t care how my dorm looks. It's just a dorm, but then she began to complain about me.

She told me that she hates that I shed. Which I do too. So I spent extra time cleaning my hair from spaces when I see it. She doesn’t like when there is food in the sink which is also valid, so I make sure when I cook I don’t ever let there be any food in the filter. I wipe down every surface before I’m done. I overheard her complain about the rim of the sink always being wet, so I started drying it when I used it.

All of these things were reasonable in theory, but somehow only I seemed to be the one creating these issues even when K or A were the ones to do it. She never ever brought up anything anyone else did like how A would leave rotted food in the fridge or how people slammed the doors or how no one else did their part of the cleaning.

It truly felt like she was trying to get rid of any trace of my existence.

And it especially became worse when she started targeting my job and trying to get me fired.

The first incident was a small thing. For my job, we had to have discussions with our roommates about the way we would live together. I didn’t have the contract on hand so we all agreed to discuss the questions and I would write down the answers on my phone. After I got the paper, I asked everyone to sign it so I could rewrite our conversation notes down and I could turn it in. S says she doesn’t feel comfortable doing this, maybe because she felt like I would alter the answers, and so I write it all down and then ask everyone to sign and tell them to let me know if they change anything. She then proceeds to alter an answer and not tell me which I bring up by text.

The next time I have a meeting with my boss, this incident is brought up, and I am confused because there is no way she would know unless S tattled on me or her boyfriend who is a coworker did. My boss is understanding and tells me to not do it next time.

The second incident was when the upstairs neighbors were being loud. S told me they were moving furniture after quiet hours, so I went upstairs and told them to quiet down. The one at the door explained to me that her roommate was just fixing her bed after they had made a bed fort. I say okay and to quiet down then I explain that to S, and then I write a noise complaint report.

Not even ten minutes later, she storms out of the dorm and gets her boyfriend to tell them to quiet down and he threatens to have them written up for alcohol because he claims he heard bottles even though he lives with people who consistently drink. Also, this wasn't the first time he had yelled at residents (we live in a freshmen only dorm) and had yelled at residents once to 'shut the hell up'. 

There are so many violations I could bring up about her boyfriend too, but I'm not going to bring those up. But I will say, that I have never snitched on him like she has about me.

The last time was the final straw.

At this point, I know she hates my guts. She is openly dismissive of my attempts at greeting her. She ignored me in public when I said hi to her, literally snatching her food and running away. And I’ve heard her openly badmouthing me to the other roommates. Also, I know she is applying for the RA position, and it's obvious she thinks she would be the better RA at this point. 

Unrelated, but I overheard her say that she would use her boyfriend's twin, also an RA, to interview with and get a guaranteed job position.

The ultimate final straw was that she also hates the fact that I get her bathmat wet.

It’s been a regular issue for me for some reason, but I know my other roommate A has had this issue at least once before because I've seen the bathmat hanging.

I’ve spent an extra 5-10 minutes every shower making sure the curtain is shut correctly or the tilt of the shower head isn’t facing the curtain or the magnets are stuck in place. Or I would spend that time cleaning up the bathroom floor and soaking up the water with my own towel before stepping out.

In the latter circumstances, I would hang her bathmat to dry then go about my day.

She’s brought up the bath mat situation three times, and each time I tell her that I am actively trying not to get it wet. 

I hadn’t for a while until recently when I got it wet again.

When she brings this up, I’m rolling my eyes at this point because what else can I do? I won’t lie. I was passive aggressive in the way I told her that I can’t do anything about it at this point and that I don't always have the energy to be hypervigilant about water getting out all the time. While she feigns innocence by saying she cares about mold in the dorm which I say won't happen because I have to check for it in my job. And she is livid.

The next time I’m at work, she’s there with my boss because we’re now having a surprise mediation. She brings up the bath mat situation and already I’m done with it. She talks about how she deep cleaned the dorm yesterday and how I’m not helping as much but doesn’t bring up that the other two roommates don’t even clean at all.

She brings up how I sounded rude to her through text and then brings up that she is ‘only concerned about the bathroom growing mold’ and brings up that under my shampoo bottles there was mold. I later checked with maintenance and they said it was just mildew. Then, to top it all off, she asks if I am ‘mentally okay’.

I do all my dishes. I sweep all my hair. I clean the kitchen countertops. I never leave trash anywhere. I take out the trash. If you stepped into the dorm, it would look like nobody lived there at first. It. Was. Not. Enough.

We finish the mediation, and we come to the conclusion that we will use a cleaning schedule from now on, and I suggested I use my own bathmat from here out.

Having been stressed out from other things, I end up crying in front of my boss after S leaves and pretty much solidify my 'mentally unwell' state in her mind.

70,1gshwbc,WIBTA for forcing my teenage son to exercise?,"TL:DR - My kid does nothing else but game and I want him to do something else with his abundance of free time.

I'm going to contradict myself here by saying I don't believe in forcing anyone to do anything.
Basically, I just want my son to do something extra curricular. He's 14 years old.
His ENTIRE life revolves around gaming. His first thought when he wakes up, is gaming.
The first thing he does after school is gaming, unless there's homework, but even then his only drive to get it done is to start gaming.
His entire weekend, if left unchecked, would be gaming.
He would, and has, gotten himself to a very hungry state because he doesn't want to stop gaming to eat.

I just want to clarify, I do not hate gaming.
I myself was a big gamer as a teen, and am still somewhat one. There's just little time and more important things to do first. If there's free time, I'll chuck on an RPG and chill.
The difference is that, when I was a teen, I tried and did other things too. I was never sporty, but tried them anyway. Tried different instruments and found love for guitar. Loved movies, so went to the cinema often. Eventually discovered the gym and fell entirely in love. Now it's my main hobby.

I don't expect, or even want, my son to be just like me. I want him to be his own man, with own interests, but he will literally not try anything new. This doesn't make me mad. Just frustrated.

So, there's a swimming pool and small gym very close to where we live. They have cheap memberships for teens, so I said I'd get him one. He said, ""well don't be surprised if I never use it"".
He is not overweight or unhealthy, but he is far from being fit. He skips P.E at school all the time.

Every week has 67 hours of free time, between sleep and school.
All I ask is for him to dedicate 2 of those hours a week to something else.

There may be some who claim he is depressed or something similar.
I really can assure you that this is definitely not the case. I know depression, and this kid does not show any signs of it. Hes also been this way since he was very young, so would be amazed if he was depressed as a 5 year old. He is a great kid. He's funny and chatty.
I blame myself for using gaming as a crutch when I was a very young parent. If I could go back, I wouldn't have let him on an Xbox or PC until he was much, MUCH older and would have taken him to different clubs.",Not the A-hole,2024-11-16,"WIBTA for forcing my teenage son to exercise?

73,1gsh1cf,AITA for *finally* talking to my brother’s girlfriend? Should I apologize? ,"I (24F) live at home with my parents as does my brother Harry (21). We both attend university in our city. Harry has been dating his girlfriend Isabel (19) for about 2 years. She is usually pretty nice, and has a generally somewhat anxious demeanour. I haven’t been able to fully get along with her, just because of one issue.

Now for some context. I work early morning shifts (6am-2pm) so that I can attend university in the afternoon. For this reason I have a pretty strict bedtime. I have a lot of trouble falling asleep, but once I’m asleep it takes A LOT to wake me up. I am a person who sleep talks coherently with my eyes fully open to other people, but still entirely unconscious. I am a heavy sleeper. This is important context. 

Isabel often sleeps over on weeknights, and mine and Harry’s rooms share a wall. For the past 2 years, she has consistently screamed Harry’s name over and over late at night (11pm onwards). She will do it randomly, Harry says he is tickling her. I have spoken to Harry and my parents about it on multiple occasions because it often keeps me up and sometimes even wakes me. Harry says he’ll talk to her and it never stops. I’ve said that at some point I will have to address it directly with her.

Well, this morning I worked at 6am, as per usual. I woke up at 3am, however, to Isabel screaming. I wanted to bust in there and chew them both out then and there. But I didn’t, be cause I knew nothing good could come of that. So I waited until after I got home from work, so that i had calmed down and could address it nicely.

I knocked on Harry’s door and said

“Hey guys i have a small bone to pick with you”

In, pretty much, my customer service tone, i continued

“Last night you guys woke me up at 3am. The screaming at night has to stop, everyone else is sleeping or trying to sleep and there is no reason for it”

Harry gave me a face, and Isabel said nothing, so i just turned and walked away. 

As soon as Isabel left, all hell broke loose. Harry accused me of screaming at Isabel, and being incredibly rude to her. He says she may never come back here (dramatic). 

My parents agree that at some point I had to talk to her about it, but think I should just apologize to Isabel to clear this whole situation up. Harry is livid and insists I had no right to speak to her about it at all.

Melanie flat-out told me she didn’t approve of her mom remarrying and wants nothing to do with the new husband or his kids. I deliberately don’t talk to her because the dislike is mutual at this point.



Melanie can’t work with people at school either. She goes on her phone and won’t talk to members of group projects. Laura complains whenever the school writes home, saying that it’s exaggerated/not true. But I believe it because Melanie’s the exact same way with us at home.



The trouble now is because Laura wanted Melanie to join a school leaders program that gives priority for honors/AP classes and some other benefits. The program rejected Melanie with a statement that Melanie had good grades but she’s not a team player and therefore a bad fit for the program.



Even though we’re not even at the same school, Laura asked me to help encourage Melanie to come out of her shell with pep talks. Her logic was that Melanie doesn’t seem to respect her or the school counselor and she’s hoping I could get through to Melanie as someone who’s her age and knows how it is as a child of divorce.



I said no and that Melanie needs a therapist, not a stepsibling. Melanie’s Dad is a cop, I know they have good health insurance, and he should get something for her because she obviously isn’t taking the divorce or new school well.



Laura asked if I could still give Melanie pep talks, but I pointed out that me and Melanie don’t like each other and Laura knows that. And does she expect Melanie to be like “I treat my own mom like she’s nothing. But oh yes! I'll definitely listen to you, stepbrother who I barely even acknowledge!”



Laura called me rude and claimed it takes everyone chipping in because therapy isn’t an instant fix when you have trust issues. That may sound valid on its own. But it all just comes off as her trying to pass the problem off to someone else considering she didn’t get Melanie into actual therapy years ago.



My Dad said he got my logic for refusing and I had valid points. But at the same token, there was no need for the sarcasm and I was rude. I’m sure I was rude, but this has honestly been going on for too long. It’s clear Melanie isn’t going to change without an actual therapist and someone needs to tell Laura like it is.

75,1gsgrns,AITA for following other girls and making my girlfriend insecure?,"She is girlfriend of about 6 months,we were best friends and my childhood friend. She has issues with anxiety and I try to be there for her giving reassurance. Our personal lives had been rough but the relationship has been great. 

Everything was going great. for a while, she used to mention that my girl following is making her insecure and she keeps going thru it everytime in my absence, and now it’s a recurring theme again. I’ve cut a lot of unwanted people off before she told me to. She was still upset that I had other girls. I never followed any female models or any such, just people from class, friends or just family. I never interact. 

I’m not too controlling of a person and I let her do whatever she wants, she is a lovely soul and I know she wouldn’t do anything outta line so I let her be. But even that makes her mad because she thinks i don’t care enough

She is a private person had only has 44 followers on her Instagram, I have 230 and I know why she feels that way. But all this aside, she has 2 guy friends, who she’s close to. One of them cozy upto her a lot. None of this sat right with me and I’ve told her that the guy is straight up flirting and she goes like “he’s just seeking attention”, “he’s funny tho” etc. he tells her that she’s one of the only good girls left and all that. She doesn’t flirt back and denies when he tries to go out with her. I told her I know you won’t do anything such and that’s why I’m not saying anything against it but I don’t like it. 

She also had a private account which she added me to and told me that I’ll be the only guy here other than her brother, and few days later she adds these two guy friends aswell. When I mentioned it she was like oh they asked to that’s why. She has removed them later but the point still stands, I don’t understand how me just following never interacting is a problem but she she follows less but actually talks to them isn’t one. 

I never had a problem to unfollow anyone because it doesn’t even mean anything to me, but I think this is a red flag in itself where she lets her insecurities get the best of her and all the time and effort I put for her neglected, she appreciates me but as soon as something small happens she neglects everything and becomes really hurtful. She cares too much about the very little things that everything else we have built isn’t taken into consideration

I keep telling her I’ll there for her when times are rough, doesn’t matter if we’re in a relationship or not cuz we know each other most our lives. she tells me she wants to let go but everything she does in my absence says otherwise. Am I the asshole for still wanting to stick around?",No A-holes here,2024-11-16,"AITA for following other girls and making my girlfriend insecure? She is girlfriend of about 6 months,we were best friends and my childhood friend. She has issues with anxiety and I try to be there for her giving reassurance. Our personal lives had been rough but the relationship has been great. 

Everything was going great. for a while, she used to mention that my girl following is making her insecure and she keeps going thru it everytime in my absence, and now it’s a recurring theme again. I’ve cut a lot of unwanted people off before she told me to. She was still upset that I had other girls. I never followed any female models or any such, just people from class, friends or just family. I never interact. 

I’m not too controlling of a person and I let her do whatever she wants, she is a lovely soul and I know she wouldn’t do anything outta line so I let her be. But even that makes her mad because she thinks i don’t care enough

She is a private person had only has 44 followers on her Instagram, I have 230 and I know why she feels that way. But all this aside, she has 2 guy friends, who she’s close to. One of them cozy upto her a lot. None of this sat right with me and I’ve told her that the guy is straight up flirting and she goes like “he’s just seeking attention”, “he’s funny tho” etc. he tells her that she’s one of the only good girls left and all that. She doesn’t flirt back and denies when he tries to go out with her. I told her I know you won’t do anything such and that’s why I’m not saying anything against it but I don’t like it. 

She also had a private account which she added me to and told me that I’ll be the only guy here other than her brother, and few days later she adds these two guy friends aswell. When I mentioned it she was like oh they asked to that’s why. She has removed them later but the point still stands, I don’t understand how me just following never interacting is a problem but she she follows less but actually talks to them isn’t one. 

I never had a problem to unfollow anyone because it doesn’t even mean anything to me, but I think this is a red flag in itself where she lets her insecurities get the best of her and all the time and effort I put for her neglected, she appreciates me but as soon as something small happens she neglects everything and becomes really hurtful. She cares too much about the very little things that everything else we have built isn’t taken into consideration

76,1gsgk5s,AITA for telling my sister not to bring her boyfriend home?,"Hi everyone!

So my sister has been dating his boyfriend, I will call him Jack for over three years. I like him a lot, even helped them reconcile one time. He knows that, we are in really really good terms. My sister and I are also really close, we are actually going on a trip together next week. My sister and her boyfriend live in a different city, about an hour and a half away by car and since our family also likes him a lot, she brings him whenever she comes.

Now to the situation, next week is my birthday and we will celebrate it on the weekend since I will be on the trip with my sister on the actual day. She wants him to come to my birthday, but the problem is he is really scared of dogs.
My family has a Border Collie and I, who lives a few apartments down, have a Mastiff. We usually put the dogs in my apartment whenever he comes visit since he is so scared and no one minds, myself included. But next week is my birthday so I wanted to have my dog there. I told my sister this and that maybe Jack shouldn't come and she got a bit defensive but said nothing. 

I understand that he wants him to come but maybe he could come another weekend next month with her?

77,1gsgir7,AITA for refusing to go out for dinner,"Hi, I've never posted on here before but I need to know if I'm in the right or not. 

I'm 17F and my mother has been struggling with alcoholism for years. When I was starting 8th Grade she had a mental breakdown fuelled by PPD and alcohol and ran away. Ever since then I have a massive problem with being around alcohol. There's been other incidents, but that's the main one. 

Since then, she keeps promising to stop drinking or at least cut down on it, but she never sticks to her word. Many times she's come home absolutely wasted and started screaming at me if I show even a hint of being upset with her. Both my therapist and hers have tried to work on something to help, but she won't listen. 

My dad tells me I need to just deal with it, and she tells me I'm ruining her life because of my reactions. After she's told me this, she'll usually calm down and promise to do better, but she never does. 

I have two younger siblings and a few times I've been babysitting and she'll promise to be home by 10, only to come home at 12. When this happens, I usually put them to bed and try not to have a panic attack. 

Anyway, onto what happened today. I have exams going on, so I'm already super stressed. My parents told me we're seeing our friends for dinner tonight. Okay, fine, I'll study tomorrow. I asked mum if she'll be drinking, and she blew up at me and told me it was none of my business and she can do where she wants. 

This is when she says I'm being an asshole. I told her if she's going to be drinking, I'm not going. I'm already stressed out from exams and I am not mentally able to deal with her being drunk. She started begging me to go because everyone else would be there and I had to start getting over myself. 

I tried to stick to my word, but whenever i try to argue about this with her my dad always steps in and ends up yelling at us both until I'm in tears, so I sucked it up and went. I'm typing this in the car on the way there. Mum has been complaining about my attitude all day and how self absorbed I am.

 Several months ago her mom came to us asking to borrow $1000. My wife and I talked it over. I told her I don't like to loan money to family as it usually led to bad feelings. It's her mom and I know it was hurting her that her mom had to ask us for money. So we decided the money was a gift and we didn't want the money back. 

2 months later she needs another $600. I am pretty annoyed at that point. This is the slippery slope. After much back and forth we said ok, but this WAS a loan and she would start paying $200 a month starting in October. My wife and I agreed this was the last time we would payout.

Fast forward to last Tuesday. I get home and my wife says her mom is in a panic and that they will be evicted from their lot if the don't come up with $1600 by today. That's in addition to the $1600 we had already give. I said I was sorry and that I would help come up with some ideas but I told my wife I was no longer willing to loan or give out money as it obviously isn't fixing her mom's financal issues.

Am I being unfair by putting my foot down and saying enough is enough and we cannot be responsible. We are saving for our down payment on a home. I know it's her mom but I feel if we don't set these boundaries it will end up damaging my relationship my wife.

84,1gsdzg3,AITAH For having my cousin thrown out of my wedding for not wearing white.,"I (28F) got married two weeks ago and I am still getting backlash from what happened so I'm here to see if I really am in the wrong.



My husband and I decided to have a child free white wedding where the guests are in white. I personally don't like to wear white because I always feel that no matter what I'm doing something always manages to get me dirty. So, my dress was not white but blue.



This all started when I decided who would be in my bridal party. I chose two friends from middle school, one from high school, my 16-yr old niece and my cousin. Since I was having a child free wedding, I didn't want anyone under the age of 18 but my whole family knows my niece is my one exception.



When we went to the dress shop to pick out dresses, I informed my bridesmaids they would be in black to match the groomsman. Everyone was on board with the color, and we found a dress that fit everyone, and the top could be adjusted for comfort. Everything was going great until my cousin asked why my niece was getting the same dress, so I told her she was a bridesmaid. Cousin said she assumed she was there for a flower girl dress since I'm not inviting anyone under 18 and if I needed another bridesmaid her daughter could do it. I told cousin no, and her daughter is a guest. Things got awkward but we were done so we left, and I took my niece out and explained she was a bridesmaid and that wasn't changing.



Everything was going great after that until bridal dress shopping. At that point I had done alot of research to find dress style I liked and who had the color I wanted or could get it. I went to the appointment with my bridesmaids, my parents, and in-laws. Everything was fine but I didn't like anything I picked until my mom found a dress, I didn't think I would like but ended up being the one and they could get it in my color. We were all happy until my cousin said something that made me snap. She said that I should pick a dress that made me look prettier and not as fat. I blacked out and said a bunch of things I shouldn't have then kicked her out of the bridal party and the wedding. A few days later my aunt who I love, and respect called to ask for my cousin to be invited as a guest. I did feel guilty about the things I said so I said yes. 



Fast forward to the wedding and it was my turn to walk out and the first thing, I see out the corner of my eye is GOLD. My cousin sat in a middle row on the aisle in a gold strapless dress. [(how she looked)](https://images.beautifulhalo.com/images/392x588/201912/W/ladies-sexy-fashion-gold-metallic-ruched-strapless-midi-bodycon-bandeau-dress-for-nightclub_1576438558652.jpg) I wanted to cry but we continued on and once we were finished, I told my wedding planner to have her kicked out and kept away. 



A few think she could have stayed but others think she should have followed the dress code. My aunt thinks I could have asked her to leave instead of having security throw her out and embarrass her.

I went to the appointment with my bridesmaids, my parents, and in-laws. Everything was fine but I didn't like anything I picked until my mom found a dress, I didn't think I would like but ended up being the one and they could get it in my color. We were all happy until my cousin said something that made me snap. She said that I should pick a dress that made me look prettier and not as fat. I blacked out and said a bunch of things I shouldn't have then kicked her out of the bridal party and the wedding. A few days later my aunt who I love, and respect called to ask for my cousin to be invited as a guest. I did feel guilty about the things I said so I said yes. 



Fast forward to the wedding and it was my turn to walk out and the first thing, I see out the corner of my eye is GOLD. My cousin sat in a middle row on the aisle in a gold strapless dress. [(how she looked)](https://images.beautifulhalo.com/images/392x588/201912/W/ladies-sexy-fashion-gold-metallic-ruched-strapless-midi-bodycon-bandeau-dress-for-nightclub_1576438558652.jpg) I wanted to cry but we continued on and once we were finished, I told my wedding planner to have her kicked out and kept away. 



A few think she could have stayed but others think she should have followed the dress code. My aunt thinks I could have asked her to leave instead of having security throw her out and embarrass her.

85,1gsdw2k,AITA for calling my best friend out for overreacting? ," I was texting our group chat that we have and I was asking how everyone was doing. Everyone replied that they were all suffering and we brought up how we were suffering too just to make sure everyone felt included. 


Later that day, my best friend texted me saying that I made it all about me  and she left  the chat where the question was asked. 

In her text she said that I shouldn’t ask a question when I made it all about myself. 

Our friend posted a photo in the group chat and we saw our classmate in the background and we were just saying how he was chilling in the background. 

However, our friend thought that we were making this about her and left the chat. Now I’m confronting her about how she has been acting lately. 

Mind you, she’s also been getting pissed when I leave her on read accidentally due to either being busy or just forgetting.  
Now she’s claiming that I want everyone to be heard but I am ignoring her.

86,1gsb2lg,AITA for telling my daughter she’s not a good big sister? ,"I (53M) recently had a conversation with my daughter (26F) and now she’s hardly speaking to me. I was basically telling her that I was rather disappointed with how she’s been treating her role as an older sibling to her sister (5F). Some things I mentioned was she hardly comes around to visit and when she does, she doesn’t really spend quality time with her sister. Like taking her out, playing, physical touch, etc. She has never really watched her when we want to have occasional date nights or go on vacation. I have even offered to drop her off at her house but she always comes up with an excuse. My daughter left home at 18 for college and has always been very independent. She does her own thing, which I’m not mad at, but she seems so aloof when she’s around my wife and her sister. My wife also mentioned that she should spend more time over here and my daughter basically snapped. She said that she has her own life and career. That if she wanted to spend time with a kid, she would’ve had one of her own. I got onto her for speaking to her stepmother in a disrespectful manner. She laughed at us and left quickly after. We haven’t heard much from her since and I’m wondering was I too harsh? I really need some clarity on this situation from people outside of my friends and family. This is my first time ever posting on something like this so please be considerate of that, thanks. ",Asshole,2024-11-16,"AITA for telling my daughter she’s not a good big sister?

87,1gsaq46,WIBTA for not getting close to my outside dog?,"For starters, I am a 22f and I love animals, more than I do people to be honest. I used to have 3 outside dogs, all 3 were male great Pyrenees named (fake names for anonymity) Bullet, Ghost, and Zeus. They were our LGD (Livestock Guard Dogs and I loved them with my whole heart and when Ghost and his brother Zeus passed, we found out that they were poisoned. It broke my heart.


Bullet was given to someone we thought we could trust, only to not know what really happened to him. It broke my heart because I felt like my whole world had been shattered after they left this world. They were my babies, my best friends, and my protectors. Fast forward to now, I have a female great Pyrenees and Anatolian mix. I can't bring myself to get close to her for fear of the same feeling.


I have an inside black cat named (again, fake name) Salem. He healed my heart, has been there for me through alot, and made me change my outlook on things. I told my 20 year old SIL, my MIL (in her 40s) and FIL (in his late 40s) that I think it would be best for me to focus on my inside animal because I can ensure his health and safety better than I can the outside dogs.


They agree with me and they say that me getting close to every animal will only do me more harm than good. My husband yells at me claiming I'm selfish and I don't love anything but myself. He always thinks that animals are going to die, even in the most unlikely cases. He yells and screams and makes me feel horrible for not wanting to get close to her or the other dogs outside.


I told him that I shouldn't get close to her and that I think I should focus on my cat. I think I might be at fault here for not getting close to her.

EDIT: My husband wanted her and we have 590 something roosters, so she is not laying outside bored out of her mind",Asshole,2024-11-16,"WIBTA for not getting close to my outside dog?
