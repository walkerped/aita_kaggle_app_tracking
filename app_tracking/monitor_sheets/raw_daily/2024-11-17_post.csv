0,1gtq2vy,AITAH for telling my roomie her bf is treating her like an inflatable doll?,"Ok, so my (35F) friend and roomie Amber (31F) is a succesful woman, she got into AI and stuff and owns a decently sized tech startup

Since I was laid off a while ago and I haven't been able to get on my feet, Amber allowed me to stay at her home, as she lived alone, as she is kind of an isolated, no nonsense person. I pay her a small rent, sure.

Let me tell you, she's no Miss Universe but she is really cute and was blessed by having a gorgeous body without having to hit the gym. She's also the kind of woman you wouldn't usually catch at the stylist, or at Sephora. True, she dresses well, showing off her curves and all, but she just despised doing her hair (even combing it) until a few months ago.

Enters Leo (36M) a man she knew from almost 20 years or so I hear. I don't know much of their history, aside that, sometime along the road he somehow broke her heart. Unrequited stuff I think.

Well, he has decided that now that she has money and is peaking, she's good enough to date. They haven't even labeled things but oh boy, Amber has changed A LOT.

First it was the hair. She got it smoothened, then she started doing her nails, buying more corporate looking clothes, high heels, I even saw lingerie lying on her bed once (and I know her well enough to know she has never used that). She even got a gym membership.

Yesterday, I overheard her talking to Leo on the phone, planning a date. And he was telling her just exactly how she wanted her dressed like, and how much she has improved in the gym, it was disgusting, and it surprised me because I never thought a man could influence such a powerful personality (I mean it, when she entered the room, she commanded respect, even though she is really short) this way. As soon as she ended the call I asked if we could talk, then I told her that I'm concerned about her self steem and well being, that this guy is manipulating her by making those disgusting requests that she disguises herself like that.

She blew up at me, demanded I stopped being nosy (I'm just concerned, come on) and said it was just creepy that I paid so much attention. It scaped my mouth telling her that I was not about to seat idle while some wannabe macho turned her into an inflatable doll....wrong thing to say, she said coldly that next time I say something like that, I would need to find another place to live, which I think is just too much

1,1gtppsc,AITA not visiting my mom living abroad on her birthday?,"So throwaway account.

My mom has always lived abroad and is turning 80 this upcoming week.
I will not be paying her a visit with my husband and my adult kids, and my husband thinks I am kind of TA.

My husband does not know how bad the situation  with my mom is, even though I have told him - it is a must-see-to-believe.
...

My mom has had two too late knee surgeries 3 years ago, and left her disabled. She depends on an old colleague who has been diagnosed with Parkinsons. He goes her grocery shopping, washes her clothes, goes to the mailbox making sure her bills are paid and takes out the trash ( a 20m walk from the front door)
She lives in an apartment but only leaves it once a week, and spends most of her time in bed drinking wine.

Because of corona and the surgeries I was only able to visit her last year and been there 3 times until now staying for a week at a tome
It was horrible.

She wakes up at 4 in the morning and goes to bed at 8 in the evening, drinking all day and taking naps on and off, doing crossword puzzles, watching a bit of TV and reading.

Not only is she stubborn, does not do her exercises ( she says she stumbles = she is drunk), but she refuse to listen to getting more into using digital services like online banking and changing GP and reading her medical records.


She refuse assisted care at home.
This is needed because she can't clean her appartment, which I had to yell at her about waiting for her to litterly pass out so I could do it my self

She is not stupid or demented - actually quite intelligent.

She is a kind of a parasite on her friend who also have sick parents in another country and they have said that it is hard taking care of my mom.
I know and told them to stop doing it all the time to kind of force her to getting assisted care at home.

I have spent 200 $ on flowers and tried to get hold of her only two friends and will pay for sushi for all of them if she is up for a visit.
I will of course make a video call and we will congratulate her.

But I am not ( for which I might be TA)going to pay 2000$ for a  4 hr visit in a dirty home I have to clean before my drunk mom goes to bed.

For context - there is another girl who is brown but she seems to have quite alot of internalised racism (she cant say alot of the things she says…)
However, I recently found out that my flatmates have been talking behind my back about how disruptive my cooking is, with one flatmate even claiming she had to “leave the room because she was coughing” when I was cooking Biryani. Its a traditional dish that smells quite nice in my opinion! 
Unfortunately, we don’t have a window, but we have an AC system as well as oven fans (which I always keep on) and an air vent, so it’s not like the smell is trapped. And we can’t leave the door open, as there are heat detectors in the corridor that could set off the fire alarm. I’m really hurt by them talking, and I’m worried that I’m pushing my flatmates away. For anyone curious, the food I was cooking at the time they complained to me in person was Paneer.  On the one hand I feel bad if im being inconsiderate but on the other, they cook things like baked bean “sushi” which feels like a slur haha? not sure what to do.

My brother Josh (29M) recently started dating Lindsey (27F), and while she’s been polite at family events, Lily feels Lindsey has made some passive-aggressive comments. 

For example, at a recent BBQ, Lindsey said it was “selfish” that Lily and I weren’t planning to have kids anytime soon. Lily felt uncomfortable, but I didn’t say anything at the time. Another incident happened at a family dinner when Lindsey remarked, “I’m surprised you two are so happy without kids. You must be really good at being selfish.” Lily was hurt by that comment, and it made her feel like Lindsey was judging our life choices. Most recently, at a birthday party, Lindsey made a comment about Lily’s career, saying, “It’s cute that you’re working part-time with no kids while Josh and I are really focusing on our careers.” Lily was annoyed, but didn’t say anything because she didn’t want to start drama. 

Thanksgiving is at our house this year, and when Josh asked if he could bring Lindsey, I told him I’d prefer if she didn’t come. I explained that some of her comments had made Lily feel disrespected, and I didn’t want that to ruin the holiday. Josh got upset and said I was being petty. He argued that I was overreacting and that Lindsey was “just being honest,” but I stood my ground. Now Josh says he won’t come if Lindsey isn’t invited, and my parents are caught in the middle.

Yesterday I went to the hospital, my sister and her friend took me and my partner (20F) met me there but she could only stay till 2pm as she was having lunch with a 30 year old a guy she’d never met before, feeling a bit uncomfortable with that I told her to just be careful around him. After being booked and put in a bed I waited there for 2 hours for a doctor with my parter the entire time in such extreme pain I couldn’t talk coherently nor could barely breathe and definitely couldn’t swallow. I was severely dehydrated and had had extremely little to eat in 5 days. Because of my very annoyed mood I was complaining when I could about waiting or my throat being sore. My partner asked me if I wanted an Ice block and I said no because I cant swallow. Every two minutes or so she’d ask me me the same question and I kept saying no because I couldn’t swallow which I’d have to repeat about 3 times louder and louder cause she couldn’t understand me. She suddenly got up and left. After 2 hours and a bunch of meds later I sent her a text asking if everything is okay she then left me on seen for 2 hours and then finally responded with “no ofc not you were taking your anger out on me” which I don’t feel I was. I feel like I was complaining more in general.

5,1gtosz5,AITA FOR UNINVITING MY BROTHER FROM MY WEDDING?,"So, this is a long one so buckle tf up everyone. I come from a big family and I hope that they don't see this because I feel like they will know right away, I wrote this. 

      Anyways, I, female 25 am engaged to the love of my life and high school sweatheart, male, 24 last year, 2023. My brother is older than the both of us, being 27 years old. As soon as we got engaged, my fiance (we'll call him Jay) and I immediately started saving up for our wedding as we wanted to pay for our own wedding and not depend on others. This year, we received some horrifying news that one of Jay's best friends who is also my little sister's husband, unexpectedly passed away. This loss broke my heart, but I had to stay strong for both my little sister and Jay. I stood by my sister as she was getting ready for the love of her life's funeral. We'll call my sister Janet. As we were discussing the funeral process, Janet had approached me and explained that she was not financially prepared for his funeral. She explained that his company was offering some financial help with the funeral expenses, but she wouldn't be able to get the money in time for the funeral. 

      As soon as she let me know about this, we reached out to our family. We asked if they were able to donate some money to help Janet. Our older siblings said that they can, but they won't be able to put together the amount she needs for the funeral.  I went to Jay and discussed about possibly helping her financially and then she can pay us back as soon as she gets the money from his company as well as our family. Jay agreed and we offered our wedding funds to Janet. She cried in our arms; grateful we could help her in her time of need. 

      Since Jay and I were basically financially supporting the funeral, Janet gave us the authority to plan majority of the funeral. From the flower arrangements to the food, to the decoration. She was mainly focused on the program and how his funeral will go. Our older siblings, including our older brother ( who we will call Jerk) were not able to be there for majority of the planning. Jerk arrived the day before the funeral, and this is where the situation got bad.

       For some context, in our culture, usually the younger generation must notify the elders when situations like this come about. We must call a family meeting, lay out the plan, and let everyone know how everything goes. This goes for big events as in birthday parties, weddings and in our case, a funeral. We do not have a father so our mother and her brother, our uncle, were the elders and we had let them know about the program and how everything will go the day of the funeral.

      Okay so back to when Jerk got to my sister's house, again, THE DAY BEFORE THE FUNERAL. Since he got there, he was making some side comments towards Jay. It started off small and then he kept pushing his boundaries the more Jay wouldn't give him the satisfaction of a reaction. He kept saying how Jay is now the boss or ""The Head of the Household"" or some shit like that. I was getting angry. Jay saw this and had pulled me aside. He told me to not give him any attention and to not make a scene especially since we're prepping for a funeral. I calmed down and we went back to our hotel. 

      The day of the funeral. It was sad but beautiful. Everything for his day went perfect. We got to grieve and laugh on the final day his physical body could be with us. The day went by as we mourned with each other. At night, my other brother, we'll call him T, had asked if I could allow Jay to go drinking with him and his friends. I was a little hesitant, but I let him. Also, I'm not a controlling person. I just worried because Jerk was going to be there. All I told Jay was to be safe, be smart and watch after T. As the night went on I received a call from T asking me to come pick up Jay. 

      I guess some words were exchanged between Jay and Jerk. Jerk was getting heated so T called because he didn't want it to escalate it to a physical altercation. I agreed and I had asked Jay to come back to our hotel with me. He wasn't happy but he reluctantly came with me. I had asked him what happened, and this was when he told me that the night started off fine and they were having drinks. The issue was when my brother T said that he was going to the store to get more drinks. Mind you, they have been drinking and not just beers. They have been taking shots as well, so they were very intoxicated. Jay was telling T that he shouldn't go and what they have is enough for the night. T was saying that he was fine and asked Jerk for the keys. Jerk GAVE our drunk brother the car keys and let him go. Jay had told Jerk what I told him about watching after T and if something were to happen to T, that will be on his head. I guess Jerk didn't like hearing the truth and got heated. 

      When Jay told me all this, I was so mad. The next day I told Janet about what had happened, and she had made a comment that they shouldn't have been drinking at all. I agreed with her, but these are grown men. What were we to do? Take away the bottle? Anyways, since emotions were running high, Janet came up with the idea of going to the movies to spend some quality family time before we all went back home.  I didn't LOVE the idea, but I still went through with it. Still trying to be civil for Janet's sake. She had just lost the Love of her life, and I don't want to give her any more reason to suffer. 

      So, I put on my big girl panties, and I became the bigger person that day. Jay mentioned that he's just going to try and make nice. We met up at the movies and as we walked in, Jerk, his girlfriend and our other cousins showed up. Then my sister popped up with our older sisters. All the girls were walking ahead and I saw Jay talking to one of my guy cousins and Jerk. We get to the movie theater window to choose a movie and that's when all hell broke loose. My sister was facing towards the boys and she just screamed bloody mary and caught me off guard. She was screaming to someone behind me and as I turned, I see my guy cousin standing between Jerk and Jay and my sister running towards them. My sister grabbed Jay and pushed him behind her and blocked him from everyone. She was screaming at everyone to f off and to not touch Jay.

       I was still in shock so when I finally snapped back to reality, I had asked Jay what had happened and that's when he told me that Jerk had attacked him. When he wasn't looking, Jerk had sucker punched him. Then my guy cousin had turned and help JAY BACK AND NOT JERK. Now back to my sister screaming. She had a full-on meltdown, given this is just the day AFTER burying the love of her life! I went after Jerk and cussed him out. Told him that he is no longer contact me & I said all the worse things I could say. In the midst of yelling sweet f yous to Jerk, I had told him that I better not see him at my wedding & condemned him to hell where he belongs. I wanted to punch him but he was out of my reach. Jay and I immediately tried to calm my sister down after Jerk was out of sight. We tried to reassure her that Jay was okay but she was not having it. She called our mother and told her to kick Jerk out of her house. She said that she doesn't care about why he did what he did. It's the fact that he did it JUST AFTER she buried her husband and the fact that if her husband were alive, he would have defended Jay no matter what. That statement broke our hearts all over again. 

      Jay and I ended up going back to our hotel. As soon as we closed the door to our room, I just cried in his arms that night. I kept apologizing and telling him that I failed. I failed to protect him. And worse of all, I had to protect him from my own family. He reassured me that what happened was not my fault and I can't be blamed for my brother being a jacka$$. I finally calmed down enough to call my sister and check up on her. She told me that she had kicked Jerk out of her house, along with Jerk's girlfriend and my guy cousin that held Jay back. My mom hopped on the call and cried apologizing to Jay and Jay yet again, tried to downplay everything and reassured her that he's okay. He had told her that it's all just a disagreement and this is how ""boys are"".

      After two weeks, Jerk reached out to me to try to talk things out. I told him, nothing can be said to fix what he did. He disrespected me by disrespecting my fiancé and that will never change. I told him that I don't want to ""fix things"" and I don't want to ever see him again. I'm revoking his invite to my wedding and if he shows up, I have security for that reason. I told Jay what I had said, and Jay feels like I shouldn't have said that. He appreciates that I'm trying to stand by him and stand my ground, but he doesn't want to be the reason our family fights. He wants me to reach out and fix things with my brother. So, am I the asshole for uninviting my brother to our wedding?

      I guess some words were exchanged between Jay and Jerk. Jerk was getting heated so T called because he didn't want it to escalate it to a physical altercation. I agreed and I had asked Jay to come back to our hotel with me. He wasn't happy but he reluctantly came with me. I had asked him what happened, and this was when he told me that the night started off fine and they were having drinks. The issue was when my brother T said that he was going to the store to get more drinks. Mind you, they have been drinking and not just beers. They have been taking shots as well, so they were very intoxicated. Jay was telling T that he shouldn't go and what they have is enough for the night. T was saying that he was fine and asked Jerk for the keys. Jerk GAVE our drunk brother the car keys and let him go. Jay had told Jerk what I told him about watching after T and if something were to happen to T, that will be on his head. I guess Jerk didn't like hearing the truth and got heated. 

      When Jay told me all this, I was so mad. The next day I told Janet about what had happened, and she had made a comment that they shouldn't have been drinking at all. I agreed with her, but these are grown men. What were we to do? Take away the bottle? Anyways, since emotions were running high, Janet came up with the idea of going to the movies to spend some quality family time before we all went back home.  I didn't LOVE the idea, but I still went through with it. Still trying to be civil for Janet's sake. She had just lost the Love of her life, and I don't want to give her any more reason to suffer. 

      So, I put on my big girl panties, and I became the bigger person that day. Jay mentioned that he's just going to try and make nice. We met up at the movies and as we walked in, Jerk, his girlfriend and our other cousins showed up. Then my sister popped up with our older sisters. All the girls were walking ahead and I saw Jay talking to one of my guy cousins and Jerk. We get to the movie theater window to choose a movie and that's when all hell broke loose. My sister was facing towards the boys and she just screamed bloody mary and caught me off guard. She was screaming to someone behind me and as I turned, I see my guy cousin standing between Jerk and Jay and my sister running towards them. My sister grabbed Jay and pushed him behind her and blocked him from everyone. She was screaming at everyone to f off and to not touch Jay.

       I was still in shock so when I finally snapped back to reality, I had asked Jay what had happened and that's when he told me that Jerk had attacked him. When he wasn't looking, Jerk had sucker punched him. Then my guy cousin had turned and help JAY BACK AND NOT JERK. Now back to my sister screaming. She had a full-on meltdown, given this is just the day AFTER burying the love of her life! I went after Jerk and cussed him out. Told him that he is no longer contact me & I said all the worse things I could say. In the midst of yelling sweet f yous to Jerk, I had told him that I better not see him at my wedding & condemned him to hell where he belongs. I wanted to punch him but he was out of my reach. Jay and I immediately tried to calm my sister down after Jerk was out of sight. We tried to reassure her that Jay was okay but she was not having it. She called our mother and told her to kick Jerk out of her house. She said that she doesn't care about why he did what he did. It's the fact that he did it JUST AFTER she buried her husband and the fact that if her husband were alive, he would have defended Jay no matter what. That statement broke our hearts all over again. 

      Jay and I ended up going back to our hotel. As soon as we closed the door to our room, I just cried in his arms that night. I kept apologizing and telling him that I failed. I failed to protect him. And worse of all, I had to protect him from my own family. He reassured me that what happened was not my fault and I can't be blamed for my brother being a jacka$$. I finally calmed down enough to call my sister and check up on her. She told me that she had kicked Jerk out of her house, along with Jerk's girlfriend and my guy cousin that held Jay back. My mom hopped on the call and cried apologizing to Jay and Jay yet again, tried to downplay everything and reassured her that he's okay. He had told her that it's all just a disagreement and this is how ""boys are"".

      After two weeks, Jerk reached out to me to try to talk things out. I told him, nothing can be said to fix what he did. He disrespected me by disrespecting my fiancé and that will never change. I told him that I don't want to ""fix things"" and I don't want to ever see him again. I'm revoking his invite to my wedding and if he shows up, I have security for that reason. I told Jay what I had said, and Jay feels like I shouldn't have said that. He appreciates that I'm trying to stand by him and stand my ground, but he doesn't want to be the reason our family fights. He wants me to reach out and fix things with my brother. So, am I the asshole for uninviting my brother to our wedding?

7,1gto88f,AITA for eating meat in front of my vegan date?,"Here’s the backstory: I (F32) met this absolutely amazing guy (M35). Funny, brilliant, intelligent... and vegan (so no meat, no fish, no cheese...) ! On our third date, he brought it up and explained his convictions, etc. About an hour later, we decided to order. He chose the vegetarian dish on the menu. I went for the burger (which, to be fair, was dripping with cheese).

From my perspective, he’s free to eat what he wants. But I have no intention of becoming vegan or even vegetarian myself. So, I simply ordered what I felt like eating at that moment.

A few days later, we talked again over text, and he called me out on it. For him, it was a real lack of tact on my part and pretty disrespectful of his convictions, which he had shared just an hour before we ordered.

Now I’m feeling a bit confused about the situation. I like him, but I don’t really see where the disrespect lies in my actions.

What’s your take on this? (Please don’t respond if you’re anti-vegan. This isn’t about criticizing him specifically, but rather about evaluating my own reaction during that dinner)

Thanks!

Edit : Just a clarification : of course he never asked me to become vegetarian myself one day. In this case, it’s the fact that I ate meat in front of him (right after he talked about it and considering we might potentially kiss afterward).

My parents don’t like concerts at all. They also value school a lot and I’m barely allowed to hang out  during the year. They got mad at me this week for hanging out with my friends who live in a different city, and going to a networking conference. 

I was barely able to attend a concert in June with my friends even though it was after my exams. I was only able to go because they were my church friends and I had to pull teeth.

This artist will be coming to the city next year in August and by then, I will be 19. The tickets go on sale soon and I’m going to buy them and then reveal the trip to them soon. I am not asking them for money or to even pay. I have a job.

However, I wonder if this would be breaking their trust. I have planned and bought tickets for other events, and they have gotten mad. They called me entitled for believing I have the right to go where I decide I want, and that I need permission. 

I have kept things from them and sometimes it hasn’t been comfortable to tell them. I recently got a job without their permission, and they got mad. My sisters (22F & 25F) have told me I’m breaking their trust, and that l am causing doors to be closed in my life.

11,1gtmrod,AITA for getting the same dress color as my friend for our party,"Mary and I (F18) are both very close friends. Just recently, we started having some silly ararguments, but that didn't change anything until our school party arrangements began. Mary started searching for her dress for the party first, and she told me about how she was going to order a light pink dress and that she already had it in her online shopping cart, so I should not get that color. I was honestly taken aback because light pink is my favorite color, and she knew that. So, I pointed that out to her and told her it would be hard for me to do such a thing since I also wanted to get a light pink dress. However, the material, design, and our body types would make our dresses completely different. I told her I wouldn't promise her, but I would try avoiding it.

She also told me she knows I'm ""not the type to do such a thing."" (as in getting the same color) I don't know if she meant it as in being a snake or what. Also, Mary didn't tell the rest of our classmates about not getting the same color as her; she only said that to me, so I was confused.

Fast forward two weeks later, I'm searching for a dress everywhere, but I wasn't convinced by any other color other than pink. A light pink dress caught my eye; however, it's a totally different style than hers, and it also has a pattern (hers is a solid light pink). I asked a couple of my friends about it, and they said I'm NTA and that I should get the color I want because it's not just her party—it's the whole class's party. So, I ordered the dress but now I'm worried I might be seen as the asshole in the party and I don't want our friendship to be ruined. so, AITA? 


UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who shared their opinion on this. I was wondering if I'm supposed to tell her I ordered the dress in the same color as hers or let her find out on her own at the party? I know she's going to ask about the color I chose before the party, so what should I do about that?

It all started a couple of months ago around August when she got into a car accident and didn’t any means of transportation as well as she was getting removed from the place she was previously staying at. Me and my other 2 roommates offered her to stay temporarily in our living room. We accepted and didn’t make her pay any rent or anything like that since she was down on her luck, with our job that we all work together in she gets an extra amount of money as well for expenses for living which would be $2,200 biweekly, she has been getting this amount since August. 

Throughout the time she has been here and moved all of her stuff in she has been making unnecessarily expensive purchases that are in the hundreds of cost. We have had issues with her which has really changed the way we feel about her being in here, She once got upset that someone took a soda without permission and she started banging on our doors and yelling at us about that after I asked my other roommates if they had grabbed anything they said no and they would’ve asked permission for it after a couple days she apologized for that outburst by making food for us but we didn’t want to accept it.

Eventually last month she finally got a car after that she had her own method of transportation to work and for stuff she needed.

After this time we realized that in our housing community people are only able to stay one week temporarily and if the landlords were to find out everyone in the house would have to evicted since she wasn’t on our lease and we would be violating the terms of it. 

Once we found this out I asked her at the end of October if she has been looking for any places to move to since it was time to do it and explained her the situation with the landlords, after this she got mad at me and said that she had been in two car crashes and that it doesn’t matter and simply walked away before I finished talking. I mentioned this to my other roommates and they mentioned that it was upsetting that she had that attitude towards me.

Now for the present she recently brought in a random person that we don’t know into the house without asking us or letting us know.

14,1gtmbjd,AITA for refusing to share a table in a crowded coffee shop with another patron because she smelled bad?,"I 22F was studying at a popular coffee shop in my town yesterday afternoon. It was crowded, but I was lucky enough to get a 2 person table with an outlet. I stayed there for maybe three hours and ordered multiple items throughout my stay.

About an hour into my stay, a girl about my age who reeked of weed asked if she could share my table so she could study as well. I looked around and every other chair was occupied and there were even people standing beside the tables. I absolutely despise the smell of weed. It’s legal in my state so there’s no issues there, but it makes me nauseous and gives me a headache, so I knew there was no way I would get anything done with that girl across from me. Without mentioning her smell, I told her no and that I needed my personal space. 

Instead of walking away, she pressed and said that if I wanted my personal space I shouldn’t study in the most popular coffee shop in town. I then told her that I specifically didn’t want her at my table because she smelled like a marijuana farm and she should take a shower before she tries to infringe on strangers’ personal space. I thought she would go away after that, but she told me she was sitting at my table whether I liked it or not. She put her things down, maybe thinking I would leave.

Instead, I flagged down an employee and explained the situation. She sided with me and asked the girl to leave, threatening to call security if she didn’t do so. 

I resumed my work but felt a bit shaken by the situation. Later that evening, I recalled what happened to some of my friends. I thought that they would all agree that she was being an AH, but to my surprise, a couple of my friends told me I was the unreasonable one. One of them is familiar with the coffee shop and told me that it was rude of me to hog a table (even though I bought two drinks and a pastry throughout my stay), and that if I really had a problem with someone smelling bad, I should have just left. Another one of my friends said that my comment about how that person smelled was out of line, and even if someone is being rude I shouldn’t talk like that to a stranger.

15,1gtlzzt,AITA for not letting my sister use my ingredients ever again?,"Hi, I've never used this site before and I don't know if anyone will see this, but here it goes. I (18 F) live in a four person household with my nineteen year old sister, and our two parents. 
For some background information, I'm intolerant to gluten, and cannot ingest it without becoming violently ill. The symptoms aren't short lived either, after being ""glutened"" I'll feel it's effects for multiple days after. My sister and other family members, however, can process it just fine. 
I've known about my intolerance for about 2 or 3 years now, and have learned a lot about cross contact and hidden gluten, which i have explained to my family. The problem lies in the fact that my sister doesn't seem to really care, and never really has.
It's not that she thinks i'm lying about it or anything. It's just that she cross contaminates my GF ingredients by using them, and by leaving chunks of food stuck to dishes she cleaned, so I have to re-wash and sanitize everything because it would make me sick to cook off of them. I've confronted her about this numerous times over the years, but nothing ever seems to get through to her. She's notorious for eating my gluten free snacks and foods, no matter how many times we've fought over it - she just doesn't stop. Granted, it's not all the time, but if she happens to like one of my snacks then she'll eat the entire thing/container. It's incredibly frustrating, she can eat anything and yet she chooses to take the only things I'm able to eat. She ""doesn't see the big deal"" as she tends to put it, and always gives a half-assed apology after arguing her defense. She recently cross contaminated my cocoa powder (again) by using the same tablespoon in wheat flour and then not cleaning it before using it in my cocoa powder. She just said ""oops"" and laughed. 
I made her buy me a new one that I now keep in my bedroom, but I just don't know what to do anymore. 
I have a cottage food business where I sell baked goods to the public, so it's extra important that I follow food safety regulations. But she's constantly using my things and doesn't follow any basic procedures, including hand washing, tying her hair back, using clean utensils, etc. It's gotten bad enough that even with my rigorous sanitation practices, i'm scared that she's left biohazards in my ingredients. I keep most of my baking stuff in my room aside from the staples like GF flour and sugars. But she's been using that stuff too. I've told her before not to touch my things, and she still keeps doing it. There's no follow up besides buying me new ingredients when she cross contaminates. 
I caught her using my things again today, and I told her that this was the last straw. She isn't allowed to use any of them ever again from now on, and if she does i'll take her tip money from the jar and use it to replace everything she used/contaminated.

16,1gtlza5,WIBTA for telling my father that he won't get to walk me down the aisle if he didn't quit his whining?,"I (28f) am not engaged, but have been fielding a lot questions from family and friends about when/if I'm going to get married and have kids soon. I'm in a long-term relationship with a man (28m) I love deeply and would love to be married to one day, but the timeline of when that happens is not up to anybody but us. That being said, I've given it a lot of thought and have an idea of how I would want our future wedding to look. When visiting my father's house yesterday, he (50m) asked me who would hypothetically be walking me down the aisle. 

For context, this is the only real ""fatherly"" thing he has ever expressed interest in doing since I was a kid. He was physically present in the sense that he would pick me up for his every-other-weekend visits and drop me back off at my mom's house (they divorced when I was 3), but he was not an involved parent and I was left to fend for myself a lot when in his care. As I got older, any time I went over to his house, I was left for hours on end to care for my siblings with no indication of when/if he and my now stepmother would be back. I became the defacto third parent and live-in maid during his weekends. We're not close now, but I visit every once in a while because I love my younger siblings as if they were my own kids. By contrast, my stepdad (61m) has been an active part of my life since I was 5 and did more to raise me and instill good values in me than my father ever had. He attended every school event, was an engaged and attentive parent, and offered me any encouragement or advice I needed as I went about my life... something my biological father has never done. 

If my decisions came without consequences, I would just have my stepdad walk me down the aisle as he is the person who actually behaved as a parent should. But because I am trying to keep the peace on my father's side of the family, I've made the decision that they would share the role of giving me away at my wedding. This didn't sit well with my father and he made complaints throughout the rest of my visit about how he doesn't like to share and I could find a different way to recognize my stepdad's role in my life (but, of course, had no viable suggestions when I humored him to ask what he would suggest as an alternative). He went so far as to have my uncle (whose opinions mean less to me than my father's) give me a lecture about tradition and how that role should solely be reserved for the father of the bride, nobody else. I wound up leaving our gathering early, but was prepared to tell him it was either both of them or neither as I did not want to entertain the childish behavior of a man who only wants to be a father when other people are watching him. WIBTA for holding it over his head?

ETA: The reason for ""both or neither"" really comes down to the siblings. My youngest brother (half sibling, father's side) has an intellectual disability as well as several medical conditions and will be dependent in some capacity for the rest of his life. I've expressed to him and my stepmother on multiple occasions that I want to become his legal guardian when they are no longer able to care for him. I ""play nice"" with them in fear of retaliation in the form of them making someone else his future guardian. As much as I love my stepdad, I fear that making the decision to only have him walk me down the aisle would have that same result. In this scenario, I would opt to have my older brother (half sibling on mom's side) walk me instead as the most peaceful solution to this issue I can come up with.

17,1gtlo0u,AITA if I don’t pay my uncle back? ,"AITA if I don’t pay my uncle back?

I (F23) have recently graduated from university and got my first job. The job is a minimum wage job and I don’t have much spare money left after paying my expenses. 

Since I was born, my dad never had a job. My dad didn’t work since he was in his 30s. He doesn’t have any physical or mental disability but he just doesn’t work despite being highly educated with a Masters degree. Without working, my dad doesn’t have much money himself so since I was young, my mom paid most of the household expenses. 

However, in my late teens, my dad told me that my uncle decided to contribute to my education and allowance. My dad never told me that it was a loan from my uncle and the money from my uncle was transferred to my dad’s bank account and then he use it on my education and allowance. I was happy back then and thought that the money from my uncle was a gift. When I was in university, my dad told me to fully focus on my studies and not get a job. He said my uncle willingly gives me monthly allowance and told me to fully focus on my studies instead of working part time. I never worked during university (I know this is a mistake on my part). 

Recently, my uncle suddenly called me on the phone and demanded that I need to pay back to him the money he spent on me throughout the years which amounted to around $100,000. He was insisting that I have to pay him back monthly since I have a job. But I find it very difficult to pay him back such a large amount of money because I have my future plans of getting married and having kids which I need to save up for. And it has been very difficult for me to find a job with decent income. Most importantly, I was never aware that the money was a loan. 

I told my dad about what my uncle told me and now my dad said I have to pay back my uncle. There is no written loan agreement and I have never personally agreed to getting a loan. My uncle is also quite wealthy, he lives in an expensive house and according to my dad, he has a few million dollars in his savings. However, I feel morally conflicted as I have benefited from my uncle’s money and I feel that I might be morally obligated to pay him back. But if I pay him back, that means I will struggle financially and may not be able to achieve the goals I want to achieve in my future. Whereas my uncle is wealthy, he can live comfortably and he doesn’t need to worry about money, unlike me. 

EDIT: I did call my uncle to thank him when he started giving the money. However my uncle never mentioned that it was a loan. During the past year, I also called my uncle occasionally to check on him when he was ill.

18,1gtl5ek,"AITA for ""stealing"" a stray cat?","I (25m) and my husband (28m) were in our backyard on Saturday when we saw a stray cat in the yard. We usually shoo them away because they stress out our (indoor-only) cat and eat the birds that come to our birdfeeders, so my husband yelled ""Hey, shoo!"" at the cat. Instead of running away, the cat came running up to him immediately, meowing a lot. We were like ""oh, I wonder if this is the neighbor's cat or something,"" and then noticed he was really skinny, DEFINITELY not neutered, and had a small injury on one foot. If he was a pet, he definitely wasn't being taken care of! 

We thought maybe he was a lost or escaped pet at first, so we caught him and brought him inside to set him up quarantined from our cat with a litter box and food and water. Humane Society is closed on weekends, so we planned to call them Monday and in the meantime put his image up on our local lost pets Facebook page with our email address.

Today, we got an email. Here is the exact text of the email (names changed for anonymity):

""Hi will you please let Bongo out so he can come back towards home. He is a feral cat but he is loved in his neighborhood. He comes to my place all the time and he stays here at night then leaves and comes back later. - Laura."" 

Laura and her sister who we'll call Sarah also responded to our Facebook post about a dozen times saying to let the cat go and asking if we got their email.

This gave us a dilemma, because like. The cat's not her cat, right? This is a neighborhood stray she's feeding, he's not neutered, he's not getting medical care. We can't just let an unneutered unvaccinated cat back out on the streets because some people would be sad he's not wandering around in the road. There's coyotes in our neighborhood! It's cold at night! He could get hit by a car or something! We responded on the Facebook post with 

""Hi! Yes, we did get your email. In your email you said he is a neighborhood feral, and so does not have an owner or any regular medical care (his back foot is injured, he seems to have some parasites, and he is not fixed). He's a fantastic indoor cat and wonderfully suited for adoption, so we're going to take him by the Humane Society to get veterinary care, a microchip, and ideally a permanent owner.""

ABSOLUTE EXPLOSION. Laura and Sarah are now spamming the facebook post threatening to doxx us and call the police on us and show up at our house if we don't let ""their"" cat go. 

I feel like we're probably ethically in the right here, but it's extremely stressful and upsetting. If it was their cat I'd never dream of not returning him, but like. He's not!!!! They're not taking care of him!! They're changing the story now to claim he's an indoor/outdoor cat, but if that's the case, why did they email me saying he's feral?

Am I the asshole for stealing the cat?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-17,"AITA for ""stealing"" a stray cat? I (25m) and my husband (28m) were in our backyard on Saturday when we saw a stray cat in the yard. We usually shoo them away because they stress out our (indoor-only) cat and eat the birds that come to our birdfeeders, so my husband yelled ""Hey, shoo!"" at the cat. Instead of running away, the cat came running up to him immediately, meowing a lot. We were like ""oh, I wonder if this is the neighbor's cat or something,"" and then noticed he was really skinny, DEFINITELY not neutered, and had a small injury on one foot. If he was a pet, he definitely wasn't being taken care of! 

We thought maybe he was a lost or escaped pet at first, so we caught him and brought him inside to set him up quarantined from our cat with a litter box and food and water. Humane Society is closed on weekends, so we planned to call them Monday and in the meantime put his image up on our local lost pets Facebook page with our email address.

Today, we got an email. Here is the exact text of the email (names changed for anonymity):

""Hi will you please let Bongo out so he can come back towards home. He is a feral cat but he is loved in his neighborhood. He comes to my place all the time and he stays here at night then leaves and comes back later. - Laura."" 

Laura and her sister who we'll call Sarah also responded to our Facebook post about a dozen times saying to let the cat go and asking if we got their email.

This gave us a dilemma, because like. The cat's not her cat, right? This is a neighborhood stray she's feeding, he's not neutered, he's not getting medical care. We can't just let an unneutered unvaccinated cat back out on the streets because some people would be sad he's not wandering around in the road. There's coyotes in our neighborhood! It's cold at night! He could get hit by a car or something! We responded on the Facebook post with 

""Hi! Yes, we did get your email. In your email you said he is a neighborhood feral, and so does not have an owner or any regular medical care (his back foot is injured, he seems to have some parasites, and he is not fixed). He's a fantastic indoor cat and wonderfully suited for adoption, so we're going to take him by the Humane Society to get veterinary care, a microchip, and ideally a permanent owner.""

ABSOLUTE EXPLOSION. Laura and Sarah are now spamming the facebook post threatening to doxx us and call the police on us and show up at our house if we don't let ""their"" cat go. 

I feel like we're probably ethically in the right here, but it's extremely stressful and upsetting. If it was their cat I'd never dream of not returning him, but like. He's not!!!! They're not taking care of him!! They're changing the story now to claim he's an indoor/outdoor cat, but if that's the case, why did they email me saying he's feral?

My graduation is coming up next month and although I’m very sad about it, I’m moving back to my country until I’m able to afford coming back. 

My brother is also starting school in the United States in the Fall (in New York) and is planning to move by the end of the year so he can get situated. 

I had a phone call with my mom and we had decided that my mom, my dad, and my brother were flying to Florida for my graduation, then after New Year’s me and my dad would fly back to my country and my mom and brother would fly to New York to drop my brother off closer to the Fall. I would also have to find a way to fit all of my stuff in a couple of suitcases to bring back.

Well, today she calls me to let me know she bought plane tickets for the 4 of us to fly from Florida to New York to spend New Year’s there and that I need to buy myself a plane ticket to go back to my country after the holidays. 

Not only is it much more expensive to fly from New York back to my country, I also have to find a way to pack and ship all of my stuff to my country first because we need the suit case space for winter clothes.

I told my mom I would rather not spend the extra money, not go to New York, and just fly to my country after January with all my stuff. Not to mention, I thought it was wrong to go back on what we had agreed on without telling me and then say I need to pay upwards of 600 dollars more than we had discussed.

She told me she already paid for my ticket to fly to New York and that I’m choosing to save money over spending the holidays with my family. 

I’m also torn because by moving back to my country I’m ending a long term relationship with my partner and I was hoping we would be able to spend the holidays together. We’ve never been able to because I always have flown back home for the holidays and he has spent it with his own family. This would be our last chance to spend it together before we go our separate ways.

When she got the call back, she called me crying cus she was scared and wanted me to join for the appointment. I said of course, it’s my mom. She was scared.. I was scared. The hospital is 1 hour 30 mins away. We don’t live together, so I have to drive to her first. I hate long car rides, and then just sitting there waiting. The reason being, I have IBS. And today, the day before I’m meant to join her. The symptoms are bad.. And they usually get worse when I’m stressed or nauseous in a car, far away from a safe toilet..

Recently, I wrote a short story about a schizophrenic woman who experienced a psychotic break. I had made sure to do my research, and I wrote the ending to end in her tragic death. Not for the horror elements or anything, but because her increasingly erratic behavior had prompted police to show up at the scene and arrest her. Not knowing how to properly help her, they instead chose to hold her down, suffocating her accidentally. The woman didn’t hurt anyone, but she broke a few things unknowingly. The whole point of that ending was to acknowledge the fact that many schizophrenic people are the victims of senseless neglect and violence because people are scared of their behavior, even though it’s out of their control and schizophrenia doesn’t equal being a bad person.

Now, content aside, I showed this short story to my friend (17F) who is also a writer. We’ll call her Sue. Sue is, as far as I know, mentally healthy. (Keep in mind I am mentally ill but not schizophrenic.) Sue seemed kinda disgusted by my story, stating that it was “super weird” for me to write someone having an “episode like that” because, according to her, I’m “demonizing” schizophrenics.

Typically he is a very sweet and kind guy who spoils me more than anybody ever did with all matters practical, cuddling, helping me through some tough times-- until he gets insecure about something and his defense mechanisms spike up.

We also had an incident when he went behind my back to talk to his ex friend-with-benefits behind my back, for which he apologized profusely for.

Now, we have a mutual group of friends and I have not talked to anybody about this side of him, as everybody knows him as a super nice, helpful and funny guy and I didn't want to air our dirty laundry, so to speak, or embarrass him. He has, however, talked to one of the guys that he is very close with (as he was quite depressed when I left, and it's okay that he needed someone to support him) but I learned that basically he never told this friend the real reasons why I left the apartment (he said very vaguely that it's because of his anger issues) and just proceeded to talk about some faults of mine, like, for example, how I didn't vacuum clean enough. This whole time that we've been apart he has started working more on himself, reading books, taking therapy more seriously than ever, so I see him putting in some effort. However, it rubs me the wrong way that he keeps saying how he has taken accountability for his bad behaviour, yet the one person in our mutual group of friends knows just the very prettied up version of what happened and not what I have actually been putting up with, which I don't find fair.

Now, we have a mutual group of friends and I have not talked to anybody about this side of him, as everybody knows him as a super nice, helpful and funny guy and I didn't want to air our dirty laundry, so to speak, or embarrass him. He has, however, talked to one of the guys that he is very close with (as he was quite depressed when I left, and it's okay that he needed someone to support him) but I learned that basically he never told this friend the real reasons why I left the apartment (he said very vaguely that it's because of his anger issues) and just proceeded to talk about some faults of mine, like, for example, how I didn't vacuum clean enough. This whole time that we've been apart he has started working more on himself, reading books, taking therapy more seriously than ever, so I see him putting in some effort. However, it rubs me the wrong way that he keeps saying how he has taken accountability for his bad behaviour, yet the one person in our mutual group of friends knows just the very prettied up version of what happened and not what I have actually been putting up with, which I don't find fair.

AITA if tell my bf that I will not consider staying in this relationship if he does not share the whole truth with this friend about why I have actually left and show me he has actually taken accountability?  ",0.0,0.0942394,0,1

28,1gtjnnm,AITA for telling my family I won’t be spending all Thanksgiving weekend with them?,"I (28F) and my boyfriend (28M) have been dating for a little over a year and a half. Last year we didn’t go to each other’s Christmas or Thanksgiving celebrations because we hadn’t been dating long and we didn’t want to rush anything. With that being said, for the past 4 years, my family and I have been doing a Thanksgiving weekend spending Wednesday night thru Sunday morning together. My older brother and his wife live 9 hours away from us. A choice they made as they bought a home back in January (even though they both work from home) and we were so happy for them. We still are! And her parents live in the same city so we understand her wanting to be close to them. Anyways, we would do Thanksgiving on Thursday, Black Friday shopping on Friday and then Saturday my older brother would go and spend time with his buddy, usually most of the day. While his wife, my mom and I would hang out at home. 

This year, my boyfriend and I have chosen to try and make it to everyone’s holiday celebrations (his parents are divorced so he has two on his side vs. the one on my side). So we (my boyfriend and I) made the decision to go to my family on Thursday and then Friday/Saturday we would spend it with his side of the family. Well I told my mom the plan and she about freaked, she said things like “you’re brother has to work on Friday, who’s going to stay with (wife’s name)”, “so you’re only spending one day with us?” etc…. I stuck my ground and I told her our plan was one we both felt comfortable with. 

As a courtesy, I made a group chat with just my older brother and sil in order to tell them our plans so there were no surprises. My older brother said “why can’t you hang out with us Thursday/Friday and with them Saturday/Sunday” and I told him that’s not what we agreed to. He then proceeds to say “I’m not happy about it either since the whole point is to go up there and spend time with my immediate family” I told him I understood but this was the only way we could get to everyone. He said “it was unfair to them to drive 2 days to be here and only see me for 1 day and have a half ass commitment from me” He tried to throw the fact that we see my boyfriends mom multiple times a year and we only see them maybe twice.

I told them that their choice to live several hours away is not my responsibility to accommodate to, that we drove to see them in July and spent almost a whole week with them. I even suggested we spend Thursday/Friday with my boyfriend’s family and Saturday/Sunday with my family and my brother said “no because we leave Sunday”. His wife chimed in and said that me saying that their choice to live far away is not my responsibility to accommodate to, hurt their feelings. I apologized as it was never my intention to hurt their feelings but it doesn’t negate the fact that it is true.

29,1gtj9b2,AITA for calling my best friend’s boyfriend a rebound to his face?,"I (17f) have been dating Cara (17f) for three years, but for obvious reasons, we’ve had to keep our relationship a secret. Only two of our close friends know.

I met Nicole (17f) last school year in math class, and we quickly became friends. About a month into our friendship, she came out to me as bi, so I came out to her too.

The next few weeks, she started acting pretty weird towards me. She’d text me at 5:30, beginning with “Good morning, lovely.” She randomly started hating every other girl I was friends with, especially Cara because I talked about her a lot without thinking. This summer, I tried to distance myself from her because the messages we're all unnecessary compliments and attempts to get us alone, so I rarely responded.

By the time summer was over, though, it seemed like most of her crush had thankfully faded. However, our relationship was suffering because I essentially ghosted her for six months while she blew up my phone with love letters. We didn’t talk much in September, and she honestly seemed (understandably) angry at me.

During that month, though, I made friends in my other classes. I met Elliott (17m), and we bonded over similar music tastes. He’s the only guy friend I have, so people I haven't come out to suspected we were a couple. But in mid-October, people noticed that Elliott and Nicole had started hanging out a lot more, suddenly eating together at lunch and constantly texting.

In late October, a club Nicole and I are in brought us to a corn maze for “team building” and she insisted we be on a team together. She kept showing me texts she had gotten from Elliott, and I noticed that she had him in her phone as “Eli ❤️,” which didn’t shock me. But then I pulled out my phone to text Cara, but I forgot that I had Cara in my phone as “Koala Bear <3.” Nicole looked over my shoulder and genuinely gasped as she saw it. She asked how long we’d been dating, and I had to admit we had been together for years. Nicole tried to act cool about it, but I swear her voice was shaking, and she was on the verge of crying, but I pretended not to notice. I made her promise not to tell anyone about Cara and me, and she agreed. We miraculously became close again after that day.

Elliott started acting cold to me. He started insulting my appearance in front of others and texting Nicole every time I tried to talk to him. Nicole kept asking questions about Cara, even offering to plan our 3rd-anniversary date, but it all seemed suspicious. She kept sending me unprompted photos of her and Elliott together or loving messages they sent

Recently, Elliott has been more irritating. He called me “a desperate wh*re,” as I honestly lost it. I sent him all the text screenshots from that summer (I had originally taken them for Cara because she was afraid I might be flirting back). They confronted me the next day, but I doubled down and told Elliott he was just a rebound for Nicole to get over me rejecting her advances.

30,1gtj5y3,AITA for congratulating my dad for his day later than he wanted,"My dad thinks birthdays are important and wants to celebrate them because they are special. Because his birthday was on a weekday we decided to celebrate it that weekend. On his actual birthday I knew he would want some kind of congratulations so I called him about 4 pm. Yesterday he called me to tell me he was disappointed that I hadn't sent a message or called earlier in the day and that he was waiting all day for me to message or call. My thought behind the call was that I would rather call than text so that we also could make some last plans for the celebration that weekend, but also because it's more personal and I thought that was what my dad wanted. I also didn't call earlier because I was at work and we always call in the evening, so I didn't think this was unreasonable.

What my dad said though was that he was disappointed that I hadn't thought of texting earlier, or texting that we'd talk later. And that he thinks I should have put my own thoughts about how I think aside and focus on what he should appreciate. That he raised me better than that. 

I get the sentiment but it bugs me that he would expect me to send something in the morning and not give me the benefit of the doubt that I'll probably call in the evening like we do. I also get that he wants it to be something special and that it doesn't take much time to send a message, but I'm irritated that he made a big deal out of something so small.

31,1gtj2iv,AITA for walking around in boxers in front of a guest I used to live with?,"
I (26M) used to live with my old roommate, Jake (26M), for three years. During that time, we got pretty comfortable with each other, and it became normal for us to walk around the house in our boxers. It was just a chill vibe, and neither of us thought it was weird.

A few months ago, Jake got a job across the country and moved out. His younger brother, Sam (24M), moved in to take his place. When Sam first moved in, I asked him about house rules, specifically if he cared about me hanging out in boxers like I used to with Jake. He said it was fine, but just to throw on pants if guests came over. Cool, no problem.

Last weekend, Jake came back to visit. I figured since Jake and I used to live together and were used to the whole boxers thing, it wouldn’t be a big deal. So, I was lounging around in my boxers like old times. Sam got really annoyed and told me Jake was technically a guest now and that I was breaking the rule.

However when I got into the shower today I noticed that it was back in the shower and I was kind of grossed out. I brought it up with him and in his defense he said he cleaned it and silicone is basically antibacterial so it can be used. I just can’t wrap my head around using something that has been used to clean up throw up on my head/body and we got into a discussion about how it’s not gross at all. AITA for getting mad about this or is it safe/okay to use it since it was “cleaned”?

35,1gtht9b,AITA for telling my friend off for texting my mom?,"Growing up I had a close friend we’ll call Doug. I met him on Xbox live when we were 13, 14-ish, and as time passed we became really close. Later on in our teenage years we would take turns saving up money and spending a week or so visiting the other (he lived about 5 hours away) over summer break.

The last time I actually saw him in-person was on one of those summer break trips, when me and my gf at the time road-tripped to his college town when I was 19 or 20. Not long after that, he texted me one day and said that he was deleting social media; I said ok. Shortly thereafter he emailed me and said that he had gotten rid of his phone because he wanted to disconnect from the world or something (idr exactly what he said, it was a while ago now). Thought that was kind of odd but said ok.

Some time passed and I stopped hearing from Doug at all. He just vanished off the face of the earth. Months went by and then years. Periodically I’d look through Facebook, twitter, whatever, just out of curiosity, but could never find anything.

That last time I saw him would have been around 2012. About two years ago, I suddenly got a message on Facebook from Doug. He had made a new account just to reach out to me, and explained everything that happened. The details don’t matter, essentially he’d gone through a really rough patch in life but seemed to be doing okay.

Since then he’ll text me once or twice a year and ask how I’m doing, usual vapid chit-chat kind of stuff, but there’s no substantial friendship like there was really. With all of the time that’s passed I guess for my own part it’s hard to just restart a friendship like that?

Anyway, he texted me the other day, I replied, got up the next day and saw that he had messaged me early that morning. I was really busy and forgot to reply, went on with my life. Later that night my mom called and told me that Doug had texted her, wanted to know how she was doing etc. and mentioned that he had been trying to talk to me but that “he guessed I was just too busy”.

My immediate thoughts were:
- why is he talking to her?
- how did he get her phone number?
- felt like my personal space had been invaded

I gave it overnight to think but the next day still felt the same; messaged him and said that I honestly found it weird and off-putting that he would be texting my mom like that. I apologized for not answering his message sooner, and said that I appreciate his trying to rekindle a relationship, but that it has to happen more organically and that him forcing it doesn’t help anything.

He said that he disagrees, that he sees my mom as a “second mom” (?), and that yes, he was talking to her concurrently. 

So AITA?

36,1gthqwt,AITA for teaching my daughter the importance of sleep?,"Just like any other kid, my (7 yo) daughter HATES bedtime. If it’s ever 9:59 and we tell her it’s bed time then she will make a huge court case about how we are depriving her of one minute of her life.

I always let it go but this week when I told her it’s bed time at 10:05 she protested.

Essentially she didn’t understand why she had to go to bed while the rest of us adults stayed up later. It’s unfair that we get to enjoy the rest of our night while she has to go to bed early.

I mean she’s not wrong, it definitely makes more sense for me to go to bed early as well since all of us wake up roughly around the same time but I needed her to understand the consequence of the trade off between sleep and early mornings.

So I told her okay…she can stay up as long as she wants. Hell, if we go to bed she can keep watching tv all night till the next morning.

Her eyes glimmered and she did her little victory dance before sitting on the sofa and enjoying her little win. My wife protested saying that she’ll be too tired for school tomorrow and I said “that’s the point”.


I went to bed and woke up at 7am, sure enough my daughter slept on the sofa probably about 2 hours before I woke up. Understandably, getting her to wake up and get ready for school was a battle that neither of us enjoyed. I dropped her off at school and picked her up again after work, she was DONE with the day and slept in the car on the way home.

Once we got home she tried to go to bed and I told her she can’t because her swimming lesson is in an hour so she needs to get ready for that.

She cried but I still forced her to go with her mom.

She came back just barely able to make it through the day and tried making her way up the stairs again. I told her she forgot about her homework and she started crying again.

My wife said we should let her sleep but I was firm on my stance that if we let her off the hook right now then she will never understand the consequences of her decision. Delaying responsibilities due to factors within your control isn’t okay and I don’t want her learning that it is.

I helped her with her homework and by the time it was 8 she was already in bed.

The next night when it was 10 she didn’t even protest, just started walking up to her bedroom and declined when I asked her if she wanted to stay up with us.

I thought the mission was a success but my wife questioned my parenting technique and said it was border line neglectful & manipulative.

I disagreed but after a few conversations with friends and family I’m slowly starting to doubt myself…so reddit AITA?

Edit: To all the people dming me about almost killing my daughter by sending her to a 2ft pool with a swimming instructor…where the hell do you get this false confidence from when running with these false narratives?

39,1gtgggy,AITA for hanging out with a flatmate?,"For context, I am a fresh uni student living with random flatmates that I am trying to get to know. My (now ex) bf was never happy with me having male friendships, and even if I make female friends he will heavily judge them and decide if I am allowed to be friends with them.

At the beginning, my first impressions of this one male flatmate were pretty rocky, he made some stupid comments on a night out and since I spoke to him about it that stopped. The more I got to know him the more I realised he’s actually a decent person, and he helped me out a lot by doing any dishes I had in the sink while I was at work and giving me medicine when I was ill. 

One time he was giving me medicine he ended up coming in to my room and that resulted in me and him playing games on my laptop - nothing out of the ordinary happened we just chatted and laughed at his aim skills on said game. Now the issue is, my bf had a problem with this guy saying he is weird and has all the wrong intentions which I personally cannot see myself and he wanted me to avoid him. I did not tell my bf about me and this flatmate hanging out which I probably should have, as now he feels like I went behind his back and is calling me a cheater all because I had another guy in my room despite it being nothing but innocent conversation and video games. 

People have different standards in relationships and I have realised there is a 50/50 split in whether people think its normal to have a guy friend as a woman in a relationship, and people who think it’s insanely weird and considered cheating.

My stance is, I’ve been with my bf since end of high school (I was 16)  and I am now 18 and in uni, and I want to be able to meet new people and spend time with them without upsetting other people. This does not include sleeping around with other people, just simply having friends I have never been able to have - making connections in this stage of life is pretty important I think because uni is more than just going to lectures.

My bf decided to leave me after another flatmate told him that me and this male flatmate have been hanging out, as he says I have cheated on him.

One of them was a rare edition of the Twin Peaks set autographed by David Lynch. So I put that one up for sale. He saw the link to the auction (I promoted it on my IG profile) and texted me like “why are you selling my DVD?”, and I told him he said he didn’t want it, and that it would be in the trash if it wasn’t for me, so I can do what I want with it. He kept arguing with me and I eventually said “do you want them back?”, and he was like “no, I was bothered because you didn’t ask me first”. AITA for this?",0.0,1.0583435,1,0

43,1gtdu87,AITA for telling my daughter (15) she is not autistic in front of her friends?,"My daughter is one of the most well-adjusted and socially adept people I have met. She has organized her own birthday parties, excelled at debate team and the Feminist Roundtable club at her school where she organized a fundraiser for at-risk young women… I’m beyond proud of her. She is an incredible person and I truly feel the sky is the limit for her.

However, she has recently made a friend group who I believe is not great for her. Three people, two are non-binary and one girl, and all of them claim to be autistic. I guess this has rubbed off on my daughter because now she is also claiming to be autistic. My sister is following her on TikTok and I guess she posts “stimming” videos and other things. She has given me zero evidence before this point to even entertain the notion that she is autistic. I truly never even considered it until she met these friends. This leads me to believe it is made up.

I have noticed that these friends are causing her to distance herself from her other friends that encouraged a more healthy lifestyle - friends she met in feminist roundtable for example who I really liked. She does not really do anything anymore but sit in her room and make videos with these friends about autism. It’s really strange and has me feeling pretty bad.

The other day her and her friends were in the kitchen and my daughter said something along the lines of “she wouldn’t understand because she isn’t autistic” about a classmate. I calmly stated after she said this that she is not autistic either, has self diagnosed, and shouldn’t patronize people by claiming that she is autistic as it is inappropriate to people who actually struggle. She got furious and stomped up to her room. Her friends followed. She’s not talking to me anymore.

44,1gtdnri,"AITA for ""cutting in line"" for the queue for the toilets?","So last night was our work Christmas party (yes, I know it's November but there was a big discount if we had it early) and we booked some tables at an event space hosting themed Christmas parties. It was in a huge marquee that had been beautifully decorated and there was a covered walkway leading to the coat check and, beyond it, the toilets. The toilets in question were the portable toilet blocks split into half one side for men and the other for women and had stalls and sinks with running water and, in the men's side urinals as well.

This particular evening, that the majority of the staff of the companies attending were women, probably 80-85% of the about 300 hundred guests. About an hour in (whilst I was in the toilet trying to work out why I'd decided to wear shirt stays as they meant I had to use a stall on every trip to the men's room) I heard a commotion as a rather loud and drunk woman announced she was just ""going to use the men's"" she walked through the door to the men's room, saw there were urinals and shrieked ""there are are urinals!"" before beating a hasty retreat. I shake my head, straighten my shirt out and leave not really thinking any more about it.

As the evening progresses the queue for the ladies' room gets longer and longer and my female colleagues disappear for more extended periods of time with each trip. Each time I go to the men's room there is at least one woman in there but I simply shake it off and enter a stall and decide not to think about it.

It was my last trip to the loo (just before my husband collected me from the party) that makes me question whether or not I'm the A in this story. The ladies' queue at this point is very extensive and sprawling and I scan the covered queueing area to see if there is a queue of men anywhere and not seeing one I decide I can just skirt round the women and enter the men's side of the toilet block. 

As I squeeze around the final woman and put my foot on to the step to enter the men's room a very loud voice half slurs/half barks at the back of my head ""THERE'S A QUEUE YOU KNOW!""

I turn, a little surprised, give another scan of the area and say; ""I can't see a queue for the men's room.""

Her response is ""WE ARE THE QUEUE."" She leans forwards whilst saying it and I get a distinct smell of rum wafting in my direction.

Taken aback, I reply with ""but, this is the men's room.""

She glares and replies with ""well there aren't enough ladies' toilets so we're using these too so You Have To Wait."" She jabs a finger at me to punctuate each of the last four words.

At this point I've had enough and a cubicle door swings open a little way behind me as a women in a navy sequined dress emerges. I reply; ""No, I don't have to wait as there aren't any MEN queueing for the MEN'S TOILETS."" I then stamp over the recently vacated stall and attempt to slam the door behind me but fail to do so as due the construction the door simply slowly glides shut.

45,1gtdjsx,AITA for wanting my own room at home?,"I am living in Japan and married to a Japanese woman. We mostly communicate in Japanese. So, maybe language is a problem too?

In April I (38 m) moved in with my now wife (40 f) into her house. While it's nice and living with her has had its ups and downs. I've come to realize that I really just need my own space.

Our whole house is decorated with her own stuff. But she has a small room that I have been using as an weight room. I was thinking of turning it into my office/study/gaming room. When I proposed the idea to my wife you can't imagine how upset she got and cried.

She said I could continue to use the living room but I told her I need a place that is mine to decompress and decorate with my things. She then said she doesn't have her own room. But she has every other room in the house! AITA here?

**Edit:**  The thing is living here just doesn't feel like home to me. It was worse when I first moved in though. When I moved in I thought the living room was going to be my space. She wasn't using it. It wasn't decorated. So I started to decorate it with my books and stuff. But over time she has started to decorate it with her own books and decorations. I've had to throw my stuff into the exericise room's closet.

The thing is when she started decorating the living room more and more with her stuff. And I mentioned I thought it was my space. She said to me, ""You already have your exercise room. If you take the living room then I have nothing but the kitchen.""

We don't use the kitchen to cook and eat dinner. We eat in her father's house next door. We cook and eat in there. The kitchen in the house we both live in is used for her hobby of baking bread and bakery goods which is purely HER hobby. She doesn't even want me to cook or anything in that kitchen.

**Edit 2:** My wife decompresses different from me. She does it by cooking, baking, or gardening. Going out.

Is it wrong to want a silent area where I can have some solitude so I can decompress?

**Edit 3:** The house and land we live in is owned by her father. The father owns the land and farm land we are living on. It is not her house per se. It is just where she is living. She pays rent to her father just like I do. She didn't buy the house.

**Edit 4:** Talked with my wife today about it and she totally understood she had the whole house decorated. She was fine with me having the one room to myself to decorate and be in. She said she is hardly at home anyway. She took it as me wanting to be away from her and wanting to divorce her which totally wasn't the case.

48,1gtcnef,AITA for telling my parents I'll do what I want when it comes to putting my name on my boyfriends house?,"For context: I'm from an Indian family.

I (24F) live with my BF (27M) of 1 and a half years, and he has a mortgage. I've lived with him since May (6 months). He's well-made, earns BUCKETS more than me, and never asks me for money or to pay for things if he can help it.

The deeds and the mortgage are in his name since he bought it, and I'm currently jobless as I got made redundant from the job I had so I can't help out as much. I still pay 30% to 40% of the bills, though, since it's only fair.

I'm doing random jobs I can find, pet sitting, selling on Vinted, and temp admin to keep my account from going empty because my ENTIRE SAVINGS OF 45K SINCE I WAS 17 YEARS OLD are with my dad. He bought the house next door to put on rent, and the property is going in his will for me and my 2 siblings.

I thought it was a good future investment since I get my 45K back with interest which would put me at 50k and 1 and a third houses to inherit since our family home goes solely to me, and the new house will be split between me and my 2 siblings. My dad never steered me wrong before, so I did it.

Being jobless, though, is getting difficult. I've had arguments about my money with my mum (barely getting me 5K of it which she said was HER money she's GIVEN me), my spending habits (she forces me to show her my bank account), bills (which she says I shouldn't be paying because it's not my house), literally ANY money that leaves my account since I left because the 45K was taken when I was with my parents and had a job.

She's said things like ""I don't want you to have too much money then spend it all"", ""I don't know if I want to give your money back because of him"", ""I gave you MY 5K and now I'm struggling too"", and similar things even though they owe me that damn money in the first place.

The recent argument was about my name being on the title deeds of my BF's house. We thought it'd be best to wait untill marriage, but recently, my BF suggested when I get my 45K back, I could put some money in the house and get my name on the deed and the mortgage since I've been stressed and my mum is high strung about it.

My parents BOTH seem to think he's using me and manipulating me to try and lower his mortgage now but I've worked in remortgaging as a Caseworker. THIS IS NORMAL ISN'T IT? They hate that we bought 2 cats, they think we're irresponsible, they don't like that I pay for the cats food and he pays for the litter, they hate ANY money I spend here. My mum says it was all a mistake and I would ""never be spending so much if I was still at home!""

Now they're saying I should ONLY put my name on the house. Not the mortgage. That I shouldn't have to pay him or be on the mortgage.

I've been saving up and plan on moving hopefully by the end of next year, but the living situation has grown to be non-manageable for me.

About two months ago my grandma went through surgery, and originally, the plan was for her to stay with us alternating her other son's house, until she recovered. That has clearly not been the case though, her physical health is good but she's suffered a great decline on her dementia after the surgery. Seeing how she's not fit to live alone my father has unilaterally decided that she's now permanently living with us.

Now, IF there was no other option I would suck it up, but she literally has a brother and another son that have both refused to care for her (alternating weeks equally) seeing how willing my father is. We can also afford to put her in a nursing home, where she would 100% be better taken care of, but my father doesn't want to. Why? Because my mom is a SAHM so all the burden falls on her and me.

I see the mental strain this has put on my mother, that whenever she isn't taking care of her own mum (who can't afford a nursing home) she's at her own house taking care of my father's. He works odd hours so he barely ever does anything, and when he's here he gets away. Today I went to the gym after waking up and he decided to tag along so the whole ""washing clothes and bed sheets drained in piss and also showering my grandma"" was my mother's task.

I've decided I'm not taking care of my grandma because I want to focus on my studies, and there are more options available than delegating the care on the women of the family. My father is not happy and is trying to shame me into complying, that's not going to happen. My mum on the other hand is also suffering this, because she can always do more on his eyes to make up for what I don't do. I want to tell her to stand up for herself, but I fear my father will just tell us both to leave the house, and she hasn't worked in about 20 years, so I know it will not be easy at all.

Am I being the asshole for standing my ground and refusing to care for my grandma at the expense of my studies, worsening my parents marriage in the process?

TLDR: My father doesn't want to put my dementia grandma in a nursing home and expects my mother and I to take care of her 24/7 while he does next to nothing. I refuse to go along with this and he wants my SAHM (that has her own mother to take care of) to make up for what I don't do, straining their marriage. AITA?

55,1gta853,AITA for calling my husband selfish for eating a massive bowl of cereal?,"Throwaway because this feels so ridiculously petty I can't believe I'm asking it.

Our kid (6) has a favourite cereal which is a branded chocolate hoop cereal. When full price it is 100% out of our budget and so we are almost never able to buy it and we buy her the cheap own-brand alternative (which she likes, but isn't anywhere near as good. But when it's 3x cheaper, you make do).
We went shopping a few weeks ago, and to my happiness they had two boxes of her preferred brand massively reduced to clear (making them cheaper than the own brand). So I bought them. She was THRILLED.

We've been gradually getting through it (I try to limit how much sugary cereal she has anyway so generally she'll have a bowl of shreddies or bran flakes or similar and put the chocolate cereal on top. She's happy to do this because it makes the cereal last longer). We just opened the second box a couple of days ago.
Well, this morning, my husband joined us for breakfast (normally he wakes before us and so has already eaten before we wake up). He then poured himself a HUGE bowlfull of the chocolate cereal. I was stunned, and immediately asked him what he was doing, and was he seriously eating that much (here is where I am probably an asshole - I shouldn't have commented in front of our kid. But he took me by surprise and I wasn't thinking). He shrugged and said yeah, that it was a ""normal"" amount of cereal to eat, he'd run out of ""his"" cereal, and it wasn't a big deal. He also said he'd done the exact same thing yesterday (having checked, I'd estimate he's had at least 1/3 of the entire box over those two bowls). I got annoyed and said that was unreasonable and kind of selfish.

While he has every right to eat as much food as he wants, and has every right to eat whichever cereal he wants, I think having a huge bowl of expensive cereal which was bought as a treat for our daughter is completely unreasonable. I asked him why on earth he couldn't have mixed it with cheap cereal to bulk out his bowl because this particular cereal is unaffordable usually. He made a comment about that box being gotten on offer so it wasn't expensive, and when I argued that it wasn't the point, that buying another box of it WOULD be expensive, he said ""then we just won't buy another box"". 
Our kid got upset, and then my husband snapped at me for saying anything in front of her, that it was MY fault our kid was upset, and said that I had now ruined his day. He sulkily ate his gigantic bowl and then stormed off to our room in a huff.

(He also said that he earns most of ""our"" money so he can eat what he wants - yes, he earns more, but WE have an agreed upon food budget. If he wants to buy expensive cereal with his own money then he can be my guest, but he spends his money on other things and this cereal came out of our family food budget).

AITA for calling him out for eating so much?


TL;DR: husband ate 1/3 box of expensive cereal which was unofficially bought for our daughter. He is angry that I called him selfish for doing so.




ETA: Because a few people brought it up in the comments - yes, husband was fully aware this is daughters favourite and was bought as a treat for her. The reason I said ""unofficially"" is because it was bought out of the family budget, and wasn't like a reward or something. Not because he was unaware of the situation.

ETA2: The box is supposed to contain 14 servings. Because she rations it, it usually lasts 3 or 4 weeks having it every day.

57,1gta5fp,AITAH for not inviting my bf on a hangout with a mutual friend?,"AITAH for not inviting my boyfriend on a hangout with our mutual friend?

Hello! I need an outside perspective. If I’m the AH, I’ll accept it, apologize to my boyfriend, and move on. Names are changed for privacy.

BACKGROUND:
I (28F) have been dating Alex (28M) for almost 4 years. We live together and share a mutual friend, Julie (27F), whom we’ve both known since our early 20s. Julie and Alex have always been platonic friends, and I’m planning to make her a bridesmaid at our wedding.

Julie is flaky—she often ignores texts or cancels plans. While she never misses birthdays or big events, casual plans are inconsistent. She recently graduated nursing school and plans to move out of state within the next year to gain independence.

In May, I organized Julie’s birthday plans so Alex and I could attend, knowing he wouldn’t have reached out himself. Recently, Julie reached out for one-on-one girl time, and we set plans for Nov. 17. Separately, she texted Alex and me in a group chat about doing a fall-themed group hangout, which would be a different occasion.

THE DILEMMA:
Alex hasn’t seen Julie since May, which isn’t unusual given her flakiness. When I mentioned my one-on-one plans with her, he seemed hurt—not that I had plans, but that he wasn’t invited. Later, he expressed feeling jealous because he misses her, which I validated. However, he argued I should have included him or facilitated a group hangout since Julie might move soon.

He compared it to how he’d include me if one of his friends invited him somewhere. I explained this wasn’t a group hangout, and it’s not my responsibility to manage his friendship with Julie. I encouraged him to reach out directly, but he pushed back, saying I was selfish and intentionally excluding him.

He also argued Julie might be hesitant to reach out to him directly because we’re dating, but I disagreed, saying their lack of interaction isn’t my fault. I often encourage Alex to hang out with his friends solo and don’t think I should have to play middleman in this situation.

The conversation became tense, with Alex insisting I should’ve thought to include him and me feeling unfairly blamed. I’ve already gone out of my way to help maintain their friendship in the past but don’t feel it’s my responsibility to keep it alive moving forward.

AITAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-17,"AITAH for not inviting my bf on a hangout with a mutual friend? AITAH for not inviting my boyfriend on a hangout with our mutual friend?

Hello! I need an outside perspective. If I’m the AH, I’ll accept it, apologize to my boyfriend, and move on. Names are changed for privacy.

BACKGROUND:
I (28F) have been dating Alex (28M) for almost 4 years. We live together and share a mutual friend, Julie (27F), whom we’ve both known since our early 20s. Julie and Alex have always been platonic friends, and I’m planning to make her a bridesmaid at our wedding.

Julie is flaky—she often ignores texts or cancels plans. While she never misses birthdays or big events, casual plans are inconsistent. She recently graduated nursing school and plans to move out of state within the next year to gain independence.

In May, I organized Julie’s birthday plans so Alex and I could attend, knowing he wouldn’t have reached out himself. Recently, Julie reached out for one-on-one girl time, and we set plans for Nov. 17. Separately, she texted Alex and me in a group chat about doing a fall-themed group hangout, which would be a different occasion.

THE DILEMMA:
Alex hasn’t seen Julie since May, which isn’t unusual given her flakiness. When I mentioned my one-on-one plans with her, he seemed hurt—not that I had plans, but that he wasn’t invited. Later, he expressed feeling jealous because he misses her, which I validated. However, he argued I should have included him or facilitated a group hangout since Julie might move soon.

He compared it to how he’d include me if one of his friends invited him somewhere. I explained this wasn’t a group hangout, and it’s not my responsibility to manage his friendship with Julie. I encouraged him to reach out directly, but he pushed back, saying I was selfish and intentionally excluding him.

He also argued Julie might be hesitant to reach out to him directly because we’re dating, but I disagreed, saying their lack of interaction isn’t my fault. I often encourage Alex to hang out with his friends solo and don’t think I should have to play middleman in this situation.

The conversation became tense, with Alex insisting I should’ve thought to include him and me feeling unfairly blamed. I’ve already gone out of my way to help maintain their friendship in the past but don’t feel it’s my responsibility to keep it alive moving forward. Meanwhile, Julie hasn’t responded to my texts in days, so she might even flake on today’s plans.

TL;DR: I planned one-on-one girl time with Julie, a mutual friend, and didn’t invite Alex since it wasn’t a group hangout. Alex got upset, feeling excluded and blaming me for not helping him maintain his friendship with her. I encouraged him to reach out directly, but he called me selfish and said I was intentionally leaving him out. AITAH?",0.0,0.06708489,0,1

I hadnt realized I had taken so much so I went to apologize and she started yelling that I had to buy her a new bag . I was really taken aback because I didnt think she'd get so worked up over it.

I walked back home with my snack in hand ready to apologize to my mother . So imagine my shock when I get home and my grandma tells me she left to go find me .

63,1gt8c3q,WIBTA if I tell my best friend I don’t want to live with her and I won’t be helping her with grad school?,"Andy (23F) and I (22F) have been friends since high school. We are very close to each other, and talk almost everyday in spite of living on different continents. For context, I moved to the States for grad school last year, she’s in our home country at the moment.

Ever since I was six, it’s always been my dream to move here. It was sort of an escapist fantasy for me thanks to childhood trauma and just terrible things I have experienced in my life. I slogged my entire life for this, and finally made it happen on my own merit and hard work. Through high school up to the last year right before I moved, Andy has always expressed how she can never imagine living anywhere but in our home town. This was until she went through a tumultuous break up and met another guy who lives in the States. In the span of 2 months, she has shifted gears. Now she wants to move here, claims that was always the plan and is obsessed with the idea of wanting to marry him.  She won’t listen to reason and right now, honestly, she’s acting like a 5 year old in many ways. 

One of the universities she’s applying to is in the city I am living in. However, there’s virtually no effort on her end in the whole application process. She botched the entrance exam in spite of the very precise tips I gave her. She wants me to write her Statement of purpose (because I’m really good at writing, apparently) and help her figure out a lot of other application stuff. She is applying to the same colleges our common friend is, without any vetting on her part (they are applying to the same program). This has been ticking me off majorly because she’s treating this whole thing as a joke, and it seems pretty disrespectful to me because she knows how hard I have worked to get here. She also has this idea that we will live together and everything will be rainbows and sunshine. I don’t see it that way. We have very different personalities, and think it will be a disaster in many ways. She is more spontaneous and decides things on a whim, for example: she has attempted 3 different career avenues in the span of a year and left them halfway to go after something else. I cannot live like that. She can also be really childish at times (to the point there are actual tantrums) and she expects me to almost take care of her. I do my best to be there for her, but I am afraid I will be reduced to a caregiver role if we live together. 

I moved here to get away from all of that. I cannot fit everything into this post, but I’ve been parentified all my life, and now that I’m finally free, I want to only be responsible for me.

And I especially do not want to do it because it feels disrespectful to my own hard work and dreams if that makes any sense.

65,1gt7egm,WIBTA for disputing a payment to someone because they broke their foot?,"My parents have really wanted a custom wooden map of the finger lake that we live on. So now that my siblings and I are all adults, we all pitched in for one of these expensive wood carved layered maps. There is a local guy who creates these maps, specifically of the finger lakes, as a side gig. I reached out via email basically telling him it’s for our parents for Christmas and I wanted him to add one small detail, which was just a little star where our address was. Mind you I reached out in early October so I thought “ Over 2 months is plenty of time” especially when he projected it to only take 2 ish weeks. He asked for my deadline which I had told him again, was Christmas. Then he took my payment via Venmo before he even started the project since it was “custom”. 

So he started it Oct 25th. On Nov 2nd, over a week later, and he sends me another email saying “had issues adding your address onto an existing sign so I’m making you a brand new one!” And then sent videos of my actual map being made. Please note that in the video the carving was almost complete. So now it’s been 2 ish weeks since the videos were sent, and he emails me on Nov 15 (yesterday) basically saying “hey I broke a bone in my foot last weekend so I can’t finish your map for awhile, I know you didn’t need it by Christmas but I just wanted to let you know.” When I saw this I was absolutely appalled. Not only has he had my order and money for 3 weeks but the map has been out of the CNC machine for a week before he broke his foot. 

The last part of the map is just adding the lettering which looks like it’s done by a machine as well. The most manual labor he will be doing is varnishing it and putting the frame on. On top of that, the fact that he said “you don’t need it by Christmas” when I told him TWICE that it was a Christmas gift leads me to believe that he didn’t read my messages at all. Frankly, it’s disrespectful as someone who’s paying him. Side note, my dad had a heart attack this summer and was dead for 30 minutes so this Christmas is extra special since he almost didn’t make it. 

So basically, this dude has our money, has had weeks to work on my project and yet is saying because he broke his foot, he can no longer complete the map, which is created with all pre programmed machinery, until his foot is healed due to the inability to drive. That will probably be mid January at least. I know it’s not his fault since he didn’t know he would break his foot, but also he had projected to finish my project before he even broke it. Also, he has a wife, she is literally in his Venmo profile photo, so he could absolutely get a ride to his shop. So now I’m left between disputing the charge to get my money back and try to find another company to make a map quick, or just suck it up and deal with the fact that my parents will have absolutely nothing to open from any of their children on Christmas. It may be petty of me but honestly I don’t know if I care. ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-17,"WIBTA for disputing a payment to someone because they broke their foot? My parents have really wanted a custom wooden map of the finger lake that we live on. So now that my siblings and I are all adults, we all pitched in for one of these expensive wood carved layered maps. There is a local guy who creates these maps, specifically of the finger lakes, as a side gig. I reached out via email basically telling him it’s for our parents for Christmas and I wanted him to add one small detail, which was just a little star where our address was. Mind you I reached out in early October so I thought “ Over 2 months is plenty of time” especially when he projected it to only take 2 ish weeks. He asked for my deadline which I had told him again, was Christmas. Then he took my payment via Venmo before he even started the project since it was “custom”. 

So he started it Oct 25th. On Nov 2nd, over a week later, and he sends me another email saying “had issues adding your address onto an existing sign so I’m making you a brand new one!” And then sent videos of my actual map being made. Please note that in the video the carving was almost complete. So now it’s been 2 ish weeks since the videos were sent, and he emails me on Nov 15 (yesterday) basically saying “hey I broke a bone in my foot last weekend so I can’t finish your map for awhile, I know you didn’t need it by Christmas but I just wanted to let you know.” When I saw this I was absolutely appalled. Not only has he had my order and money for 3 weeks but the map has been out of the CNC machine for a week before he broke his foot. 

The last part of the map is just adding the lettering which looks like it’s done by a machine as well. The most manual labor he will be doing is varnishing it and putting the frame on. On top of that, the fact that he said “you don’t need it by Christmas” when I told him TWICE that it was a Christmas gift leads me to believe that he didn’t read my messages at all. Frankly, it’s disrespectful as someone who’s paying him. Side note, my dad had a heart attack this summer and was dead for 30 minutes so this Christmas is extra special since he almost didn’t make it.

67,1gt7bn5,AITA for suggesting my mom break up with my stepdad ,"I 18 Female am on a trip from hell with my family. I was a little reluctant when my stepdad (m35) and my mom (f41) suggested we go on a family vacation. My mom and stepdad are extremely prone to arguing and I knew it would be a shit storm that I didn’t want to get stuck in, but of course they pressured me to go. It didn’t help that my two younger siblings pressured me to go. I felt bad leaving them to go alone especially since they would have to travel with an adult at all times. 

Before we had even booked the trip tickets my stepdad gathered all of us together. My mom was really excited to go back home for the first time in years. She smiled and instantly my stepdad had a problem that she smiled because apparently she wasn’t taking things serious enough. He threatened to not book the tickets after a big fight they ended up booking the tickets. 

The trip has honestly been very jam packed and eventful we have been all over the island but my stepdad has been making this trip miserable finding ways to ruin moments by picking fights with my mom. To make things worst we all have food poising and have been sharing one bathroom. Safe to say tensions have been high. 

One of our pits stops we visited my my great grandparents. We had to drive up a mountain because my great grandparents live in a small mountain village. which I wont lie was very scary to do in a foreign country. There are no guard rails so one wrong move car is going flying straight off the mountain.  My stepdad made the car ride so tense. He forbid all of us from making a noise. I sneezed and he started cussing at me and flipping out. When we got up the mountain we only stayed for 20 minutes because he was nervous about it getting dark on the way down. They offered for us to stay the night and my mom begged to stay longer. Her grandparents raised her and she had her seen them in years and god knows when’s gonna be the next time. They are pushing almost 98 both of them. My stepdad didn’t want to stay in “twig homes” So back to the hotel  we went in silence. 

The next day my mother got her period. Both me and my mother get horrible period pain. To the point where we both experience nausea. My stepdad argued with my mom for having no energy and screamed, laughed and mocked her through the bathroom door over the noises of her crying and literally throwing up from the pain of her period. 

Later when she came out I asked her why are you even with him. What I don’t know is that he was in ears shot. this set him off so bad and he screamed in my face. That I was trying to destroy his relationship. That I was the devil and horrible and evil. I was called manipulative. I knew I should have just stayed home. I don’t know why I thought this trip would be any different. I know that you should try to work things out but I feel like my mom shouldn’t am I the asshole ?

I've tried to be there for them. helped all of them through break ups, family issues, etc. I put off my own personal stuff to be there with them when they need me. But lately they have been pissing me off. They started hanging out without me and when I asked about it they seemed genuinely sorry for doing that and that they would try better.

So now we hang out a-lot again but lately they have been assholes to me. They started to judge me for doing shit that they do, and they started making jokes about personal issues l've had. Then they don't even seem closely interested in my life or how im doing.

Now they keep on getting mad at me for not wanting to hang out as enthusiastically when she is involved.

Also, all my ""best friend"" does now is send me insta reels (which i respond to every single one) and complain about his life without caring about how i'm doing. And I listen to every single detail and try to help the best I can without intruding in to stuff that is none of my business.

I know maybe i'm being dramatic for saying that my friends don't care about how I am doing. But, I'm not doing the best mentally right now and none seem to care. (this being said in the least pick-me way possible)

I was granted bi-weekly visits with two of them, 8mo old and 2 year old, with weekly visits with the other four. Given the context that I practically raised most of them, besides the second oldest of us, I think its way too little, but I rest my case. After two weeks of not being able to hold my youngest sister, I finally get my first visit on Wednesday but she arrives to the visit asleep. The woman who is fostering her told me that though this was the agreed upon time by all of the guardians involved, the only time we have together coincides with her new napping schedule. She told me to be grateful I got to see her and to just play with my second youngest sister who was also there, mentioning that I shouldn't touch her. I entirely ignored this and woke her up, playing with the both of them the full time. (doing things like lying on the ground with her o just letting her gab around at a toy) The people fostering me bought me home and I thought everything was fine until I overheard the woman fostering her mention to the woman fostering one of my brothers that I had ""ruined her sleep schedule, she hasn't gone to bed till midnight since."" at court on friday. That same day I found out my mother's parental rights are likely going to be terminated, and all of us placed into the system for the older siblings and the younger ones adopted.

I pointed out that, although pork allergy is technically possible, it is extremely rare and the symptoms are very different to what he has experienced (I have a background in healthcare).

And I felt so shitty cause for some reason this time I had his bday remembered for the 23rd. Also I don't wanna make him feel unwanted and unappreciated. Any advice?

We both still live at home, and he works and I do not, as I am currently taking a gap semester because of the state of my mental health. I entirely understand why I would do more housework than the other two, given I have far more free time - but my mom and I contribute equally in cleaning, doing dishes, laundry, etc. Not only does my brother not contribute to keeping the house clean, he actively makes our lives harder. And now that my mother has had surgery, and can no longer help at all, i'm left out of my wits taking care of a 4 bedroom house with 5 pets basically single-handedly - along with taking care of my mother who can't even get to the bathroom by herself.

The worst part is, he won't listen, and he actively takes pleasure in ignoring me when I ask him to do something, like take the dogs out or do the dishes. He leaves it behind and disappears into the basement or goes out on a drive where we can't reach him, so it has to be done while he's away.

When I call him out for his behavior, he always brings up things like how I don't do anything with my life, or how I have no right to tell him what to do because i'm younger, or don't work. Or he just yells or shushes me and storms off. The worst part is, my mom makes excuses for him, praising him for doing the smallest things, like taking care of her for a few hours on a Saturday so I could shower and decorate for Christmas - after I took care of her for forty-eight hours straight.

He doesn't listen to me. Ever. So I have to ask my mom to tell him, because at least she has a chance to get him to actually listen. But she shuts me down too, thinking that the reason I report everything he doesn't do or every mess he makes because i'm being petty, or want to get him in trouble. She tells me if I see it, I should just clean it. But I don't want to reward a grown ass man for making me clean up after him like i'm his mommy.

I know he works, and I know he's probably stressed at his first job. I know that he has a social life and cooks and does his laundry mostly separate from us.

77,1gt5e33,WIBTA if I told my dad's partner's sister she was completely out of line at his funeral?,"My parents split up in the early 90s after 24 years of marriage, and eventually divorced. They remained on reasonably good terms, my dad would still visit my mum's family, my mum is still invited to family events on dad's side. My mum has remained single, my dad had a number of partners and then around 12 years ago met Zara and they had a great relationship until my dad died suddenly two years ago. They were not married and did not live together, did not share finances and my brother and I were listed as his next of kin.

After dad died I had primary responsibility for organising the funeral. Dad's bank account paid for the cremation, cars, officiant etc. I paid for flowers and for a ""reception ""and buffet lunch for 75 people afterwards. My mum was a great help with the organising and supporting my brother and I. Zara was completely included in the planning. She chose dad's final outfit, she contributed to the eulogy from the officiant, she had final say on the coffin, she chose some of the flowers for the coffin and she chose one of the three pieces of music in the service (one I chose, one dad had always said he wanted at his funeral so really he chose it). On the day, there were six of us in the first car - me, my brother, my mum, Zara, her daughter and her sister Lucy, and the six of us sat together in the first pew.

After the funeral at the reception, we had a display table set up with photos in frames and an album. The photos were contributed by us, by Zara, by the wider family and by mum. My mum told me today that at one point, she had gone to move some of the photos as they had been knocked over, and Lucy barged her out of the way, told her it was not up to her to touch the photos and then said ""I don't know why you're even here anyway, this is nothing to do with you."" My cousin's wife has confirmed it as she witnessed it.

Mum didn't tell me at the time because the day was hard enough and she knew I'd kick Lucy out if I knew, and that would have been hard for Zara. But now that I do know, I am absolutely furious with Lucy. My mum had every right to be there to pay her respects to her ex-husband with whom she had two children and who remained a friend after their divorce. She had every right to be there because my brother and I wanted her there. She had every right to be there because my dad would have wanted her there. And even if she didn't have the right to be there, it absolutely was not Lucy's place to say so.

TLDR: my dad's partner's sister was horribly rude to my mum at his funeral two years ago but mum didn't tell me because she knew I'd kick her (the sister) out.

They’re great most of the time, but my mother is a bit of a perfectionist, or narcissist. I don't know how to explain it but she always tries to pick at something, no matter how minute or inconsequential, so she can show her ""superiority.""

Anyway, my husband has this quirk where he likes to hang out on the stairs. Sometimes he’s on the landing, sometimes the top, sometimes the bottom. He’ll sit, lie down, or even drape himself in weird positions. He’s not hurting anyone—it’s just him. It’s his way of chilling, and honestly, I find it endearing.

My mother was not a fan. She kept giving him side-eyes and finally said something like, “Why is he sitting there? He’s not a child. He can sit in the living room like an adult.”

I shrugged and told her, “It’s our house. He can sit however and wherever he wants.”

That set her off. She started going on about how it’s “weird” and “not proper” and how it’s embarrassing that he acts like this. I didn’t budge—I wasn’t about to tell my husband where he can or can’t sit in his own home. Things escalated, and eventually, she stormed out in a full-on hissy fit, saying she wouldn’t “be a part of this nonsense.” She took the car and went to a hotel in town, leaving my dad behind.

The thing is, she has no reason to go upstairs, so it's not like my husband was disrupting her. He was just using his phone (sometimes he reads books on the stairs too, but not this weekend). The only things upstairs are my husband’s office, our room, and a small half bathroom, (a half bathroom is a bathroom without any bathing utilities, just a sink and toilet.)

My dad and I had a great night catching up. He didn’t care one bit about the “stair thing” and just laughed it off. Now I’m left wondering if I was too harsh on my mom. I know she can be dramatic, but maybe I should’ve tried to smooth things over instead of digging my heels in.

79,1gt52ht,AITA for wishing my “friend” a happy birthday?,"Around July 4th, a huge conflict between my  (19F) friend group broke out. This group consists of 3 people including me, let’s call them R (20F) and J (19F). We’ve been a trio friend group since middle school, but I have known J since elementary school, but we all got along well and never had any problems at all until the this Summer. Since we all go to different colleges (I’m out of state), R is going to a local college and J went out of state but took a gap semester for the Spring, whenever I come back home I try to plan hangouts because I miss them. 

However, when I came home for July 4th and tried to make plans, R kept canceling last minute or lying saying she was at work even though I had her location. It was also Js birthday a week before and R avoided celebrating a total of 5 times in 5 days (I asked to hang everyday). So we knew something was wrong, we decided to text her in the group chat nice messages hoping she was okay, but her response was very rude and accusing us of not understanding that she was “busy”. She also said that her mindset had changed, whatever that even means. 

We tried to talk more, but she just didn't
reply, until a few days later R privately
messaged me and said the reason she's
been avoiding hanging out is because she
doesn't wanan be friends with J anymore.
This came as a shock to me and J because
nothing ever happened between them and it
was out of nowhere. J was very confused
and upset and kept asking why, but R just
said she “outgrew"" the friendship. We
honestly thought it might be because J is
gay, but she has been out for years without issue. Then we assumed it was her boyfriend because his reposts on tiktok were lowkey concerning. 

This obviosuly put me in a very weird spot where it felt like I had to choose between my two closest friends because J was very upset that R gave up on being friends even though nothing even happened, they haven’t even hung out without me even though J has tried multiple times to plan something. R still wanted to be friends with me so it was just a bad place. Then a few weeks later, R sent J a very long paragraph bascially saying that she didn’t wanna be friends anymore because she thought J was a negative person all the time. I thought this wasn’t true, however, in high school she was very negative, but i later found out it was because she had an very severe ED and we also talked to her about her attitude during that time and she apologized and changed (before we knew about her ED). So to us this reason didn’t make sense at all. After this I didn’t reach out to R, but still kept her on my private story and followed her, but J blocked R. 

Then last night I wished R a happy birthday at midnight because even though I didn’t know where we stood as friends, I still wanted to say happy birthday.

80,1gt4v1c,AITA for being sad and watching Arcane 2?,"

This is my first time posting here, and I'm a big fan of this subreddit. I need some insight, and I thought you guys could help me. English is not my first language, so I apologize for any mistakes.

I (28F) and my boyfriend (NB, 34) have been dating for about 7 months. They live in North America, and I'm in South America. The relationship is great overall; they buy me tickets to visit them, and when we’re together in person, everything is perfect. However, we sometimes have communication issues since I have ADHD and they have Autism.

Today, I was feeling really down. My family situation is difficult; we’re taking care of an abusive grandmother who’s causing stress, and we’re all planning to move out. To top it off, one of my old cats (15 y.o.) passed away a week ago, so I’m not doing well emotionally.

They asked why I was sad, and I told them that everything happening is overwhelming. Plus, we hadn’t talked much yesterday, so I felt lonely. I was playing League of Legends with a friend at the time, and our conversation went like this:

**BF:** How’s League going?  
**Me:** It's meh.  
**BF:** What champ are you using?  
**Me:** Lulu, but my ADC is bad.  
**BF:** I don’t know her.  
**Me:** She’s a Yordle, like Heimerdinger from Arcane.  
**BF:** Oh, the guy with the mustache?  
**Me:** Yep!  
**BF:** I see there are new episodes of Arcane. Want to watch them later?  
**Me:** Oh, sorry, I already watched them. I was feeling sad and needed a distraction (we have a 5-hour time difference).  
**BF:** You should’ve waited for me... It’s something we do together when we’re apart.  
**Me:** I know, but I was feeling down and watched it. I can rewatch it with you.

I apologized multiple times, but they kept saying how hurtful it was that I watched it alone. Normally, I’d wait, but I really needed the comfort of my favorite show. I felt worse after this, so I suggested we discuss their feelings later when I wasn't so upset, as it felt like the conversation was shifting to how they felt instead of comforting me.

When BF is sad, I always try to comfort them, even if they’re not in the best mood. I usually bring up how it made me feel later, once things have calmed down. So, I felt their feelings were valid, but maybe they could’ve waited until I was feeling better? They said my suggestion to wait made them feel like I wasn’t validating their feelings. They believe if they’re upset, they should express it immediately, but I feel there’s a time and place, which they often miss.

So, am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-17,"AITA for being sad and watching Arcane 2?

However, we sometimes have communication issues since I have ADHD and they have Autism.

Today, I was feeling really down. My family situation is difficult; we’re taking care of an abusive grandmother who’s causing stress, and we’re all planning to move out. To top it off, one of my old cats (15 y.o.) passed away a week ago, so I’m not doing well emotionally.

They asked why I was sad, and I told them that everything happening is overwhelming. Plus, we hadn’t talked much yesterday, so I felt lonely. I was playing League of Legends with a friend at the time, and our conversation went like this:

**BF:** How’s League going?  
**Me:** It's meh.  
**BF:** What champ are you using?  
**Me:** Lulu, but my ADC is bad.  
**BF:** I don’t know her.  
**Me:** She’s a Yordle, like Heimerdinger from Arcane.  
**BF:** Oh, the guy with the mustache?  
**Me:** Yep!  
**BF:** I see there are new episodes of Arcane. Want to watch them later?  
**Me:** Oh, sorry, I already watched them. I was feeling sad and needed a distraction (we have a 5-hour time difference).  
**BF:** You should’ve waited for me... It’s something we do together when we’re apart.  
**Me:** I know, but I was feeling down and watched it. I can rewatch it with you.

I apologized multiple times, but they kept saying how hurtful it was that I watched it alone. Normally, I’d wait, but I really needed the comfort of my favorite show. I felt worse after this, so I suggested we discuss their feelings later when I wasn't so upset, as it felt like the conversation was shifting to how they felt instead of comforting me.

When BF is sad, I always try to comfort them, even if they’re not in the best mood. I usually bring up how it made me feel later, once things have calmed down. So, I felt their feelings were valid, but maybe they could’ve waited until I was feeling better? They said my suggestion to wait made them feel like I wasn’t validating their feelings. They believe if they’re upset, they should express it immediately, but I feel there’s a time and place, which they often miss.

He has been with me in moments like when I got myself panicked when home alone one night, he came running when I called him for support. I will always be thankful to him for that. 

But on Friday this week, things fucked up. We were sat at break at school and he made a fucked up joke about my mother. For context, it was an overweight joke and my mother struggling with losing weight has had a big effect on me. So when he made that joke, I got super pissed and told him almost verbatim ‘If you ever make a joke like that again I will punch you’

He then got super pissed because we make overweight jokes about him. Again, context, he is a bigger person but I would say that most of it is muscle and he is crazy strong. I understand why he would be pissed but the problem I have is that he has never said anything about the jokes. Every time a joke was made, he said ‘I am’ or laughed. He’s never made any attempt to stop people saying them or voiced that it was a problem. So I was confused where it came from. And, my problem was is that I would’ve stopped the jokes on my part if he voiced that it was a real problem for him. So I told him that and he just said ‘Yeah, sure’ and ignored me from then.

We didn’t talk for the rest of the day and now I’m feeling guilty for getting pissed and wonder if I overreacted. But then I’m also still pissed and feel myself getting angry when I think about it.

We each paid for our tickets and have held onto them for the year until the show last night. 
He expressed that he wanted to go, so I told him i will try to find some if i could so we could go together instead. It was impossible to find extras and I couldn't make it happen. He got upset because I was still gonna go with my friend like we originally planned. Few hours before the show he texts me and says that he should be taking him instead and that he will resent me forever and that I'm making him feel  like second best and that I don't care about him. Tells me it's over and dumps me. 

Im just trying to understand why and he said I chose her over him and I don't care about him. 
Said I could have found a way to take him instead but I didn't want to hurt my friend and change our plans. I clearly said if I would get more tickets I would go with him instead and she could have the original tickets to go with someone else. 

Made a case that since we have seen her in concert before that he deserves it more.

85,1gt3cc6,AITA for reacting when my dad talks about my mom?,"My mother passed away suddenly almost two years ago due to cardiac arrest. It was one of the worst days of my life and ever since she passed i feel that it has been very difficult, which is expected because grief is a process. To fill you in on my father, he is an alcoholic and has been divorced from my mother for 20+ years. Before she passed away she had remarried a man that truly loved her and had a child with him.

When my mother passed away, my brother and I had gone to the funeral home with my moms siblings to make arrangements for the funeral, my father had called me earlier that day and asked if we wanted to get together like the old days and i figured it would be good for us to hang out because i needed some support after the loss... However, when my brother and I didnt show up to the place at the decided time my father called and said that he was processing the loss hard and decided to go home, i told him that that would be fine and we would talk the next day. The next day he said ""You and your brother just ditched me and didnt even call me "". I lost it and told him that my brother and I were busy taking care of funeral arrangements and that I had told him we were going to be busy. As the years have progressed, my father has started going to church but is still a bad alcoholic and was recently diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver.

 My dad has been going to church for about a year now and has tried encouraging me to go with him, but being a lesbian woman in Texas, I'm not very comfortable going to church. One night, he told me about how in my moms last moments (she was comatose) that she told him to take care of my brother and I (brother 32) and that it would make her happy if I started to follow Jesus like my him. No matter how many times i tried to explain to him that my mom never pressured me to believe in Jesus or attend church, he insisted that thats what she would want me to do. I told him to stop using my mom against me and he said ""im not."" Another instance, is he likes to say that my mom (the woman who divorced him for being an alcoholic cheater) would be so proud of him for going to church and that she speaks to him and he speaks to her. However when he says this he's always drunk. 

One day I explained to my dad that seeing my mom pass away was difficult for me and I asked him respectfully if we could not talk about that day... He proceeded to talk about much harder it was for him to lose his mom (my grandma ) and began to raise his voice, i raised my voice with him and said ""are we having a whos trauma was worst contest?""

It turns out they've taken a shine to me, and apparently can be quite clicky and don't like the other white girls who dont make an effort with them. If I have any questions they'll help, if I have a difficult patent or someone rude to me they'll step in, but tbf they don't do this with any of the other girls, they do treat me better than the others. 

The others have noticied and have been giving me the cold shoulder saying I'm sucking up and purposely making them look bad, that it's cultural appropriation and that all I'm doing is pandering and trying to be Filipino because I'm a white girl who's never actually been to the Philippines and my partner isn't actually from there. 

So AITA? Should I stop? Should I ask the others if they find it too much, should I stop with the food and the slang etc. ",0.0,0.023663105,0,1
91,1gt23zu,AITA for cursing at my partner for pressuring me to buy a TV? ,"

I(23F) started dating this guy(20M) a few months ago(it’s been two months since we became official) and things have been going really well. This is not a bf diss track. 

We usually hang out at my place since he lives with his parents, and he noticed that I don’t own a tv and finds it weird. Now I’ve been living by myself for years and I’ve never owned one simply because I never felt like I needed one. Everything I like to do in my free time, I can do it on my laptop. My parents own a tv but I never ever use theirs when I visit them. It’s just not my thing. I have one bed, one couch, and one beanbag(he bought it for me) in my apt and that’s it. No chair, no additional lights(I use candles), no tv or gadgets, no thank you. 

He’s been suggesting me to buy a TV for a while saying that it’ll be nice to be able to watch something and have something to talk about. He’s a gamer and said he could bring his game consoles so we can play some video games together. He said that people would find it odd that I don’t own a tv if I invite them over since everyone owns one. 

I don’t agree with any of the points he made. 
We can watch shows on my laptop(a bigger screen would be better, that’s what he said, I think not), the video game thing, that’s mainly what he wants to do as I’m not a gamer myself. The last point, I find it most outrageous, because, who cares what others think? I don’t even like to invite people over in general and if I do and if they have issues with me not owning a tv they can pack and leave. It’s my apt, I have no obligation to cater to anybody else besides me. 

I’ve made it clear to him that I’m not getting a tv and he keeps being persistent. 
And one day when I had enough of him pressuring me to buy something I don’t want, I cursed at him. I told him that he’s being a fucking asshole and if he wants a tv in my apt that much he can buy me one and set that up all by himself.  

He has a tendency to be bossy or gives me lots of advice and it usually doesn’t bother me and I even appreciate it sometimes(I can be spacey and reckless) because I know that he means well. But some of the suggestions he makes, I find it off putting like this tv thing or him telling me to buy more utensils(I have one pair of fork and knife, no spoon, I eat out 5-6 days of the week) 
He seemed really hurt when I cursed him out, and now I feel like maybe I could’ve been less mean. 

He comes over to my apt about once a week if any of y’all are curious. 

Edit: imma add this info as someone in the comments kindly suggested; it’s been 3 weeks since I moved into my new apt and my old place had chairs and a couch and everything. I just haven’t bought much for my new place as I already have what I really need atm. ",Everyone Sucks,2024-11-17,"AITA for cursing at my partner for pressuring me to buy a TV?

92,1gt1w4l,AITA for uninviting my best friend to my birthday on the day?,"This all happened over a year ago but it plays on my mind sometimes.

I (29M) met one of my former best friends Trixie (32F) when I was 18 at university in London, where we are from. Our families know each other, we've lived together, been on holiday together, used to speak every day etc.

During my 20s I was barely ever in the UK but we made an effort to visit each other at least once a year, wherever we were. 2 years ago, she met a woman (34F) in Spain and very quickly moved in with her and eloped (lesbians, right?)

That year I moved back to our hometown and Trixie came to visit. It was a good time but there were a few oddities like her telling me her wife made her delete Instagram for posting too much. Then seemingly out of the blue, her wife broke up with her via text. Naturally, she was distraught so I accompanied her through this and she stayed with me throughout her trip. 2 days later happened to be my birthday party and she was understandably a mess. Despite it being my birthday, most of the attention was on her but I let it slide because she had just gone through something quite traumatic. A week  later she took her flight back to Spain to talk to her wife and potentially get her things to move back to London.

For about a year, communication got quite sparse for the first time in our friendship. When I asked her about her wife or life plans, she avoided the subject so I gave her space. I assumed they had just gotten back together and she was a bit embarrassed as it probably wasn't the right thing to do.

Then last year she said she was coming to visit London again with her wife and the visit happened to coincide with my birthday so I was excited to see her and leading up to the trip, we started talking every day again. I invited everyone (around 20 people) for 3PM but asked close friends to come earlier for lunch at 1PM (including Trixie and her wife).  I didn't hear from Trixie all day so messaged at 3PM to ask. At 4PM, I got a nonchalant response ""Just having some lunch with the wife. Will come later"" I was annoyed but also quite occupied with my birthday festivities. Other friends kept asking about her so at 8PM, I nudged again and she said she was on her way but her wife was feeling a bit down. Then at 9PM she said she had arrived so would grab a coffee and then come and asked where we were. At this point I was a bit drunk and at a bar so I just said ""On my way home. I invited you 8 hours ago"", to which she didn't reply. I actually stayed out past midnight but just didn't want to deal with her, especially after she hijacked my birthday the year before. 

No communication until a week later, when I reached out to ask if she would be at a mutual friend's event, which she was. We didn't talk about my birthday and it was a bit awkward. And we haven't spoken since.

Tldr: My friend was messy on my birthday and the next year, she was about to turn up 8 hours late so I told her not to bother coming. No communication since.

93,1gt1qq8,AITA for asking my girlfriend to clean my car,"Just looking for outside perspective if I am prioritizing the wrong things. I (m23) and my gf (24) have been together for 3.5 years. Just over a year ago we moved to be closer to my parents as we both where far away from any family. Upon moving she had challenges find a job that she liked, and upon talking it over with my parents they encouraged her to start her own business mobile detailing as that's what she was doing before we moved. Now over a year later she is doing great!

In order to start the business she needed a vehicle to work out of. Well about 2.5 years prior I bought a pretty nice rhd Subaru wagon (bp5 iykyk) and I told her she's more than welcome to use it for work. 

The issue has arrose because about 2 months ago I noticed the air compressor has leaked some rusty water on the back of the seat while it was folded down, I mentioned it and she cleaned it up. About a week later while I was helping her on a detail I wondered if the water had gotten anywhere else. So I lifted the seat and sure enough there was more trusty water. Now the seats in this car are both leather on the sides and suede in the center, and some of the rusty water had gotten into the suede so I asked her again if she would clean it when she had time.

Well that wasabout 4-5 weeks ago and this morning I asked her if she ever got around to cleaning it. And she responded that she has been too tired and exhausted from running her business to clean the seat. Needless to say it sparked quite the argument and now she is saying I'm prioritizing my material possessions above her. 

Am I asking too much?? Should I have just done it myself? I fear this may be blown out of proportion as I have asked her to monitor the front tire of the car aswell as i have seen it has been low on air (15~psi) but as I do not drive the car and it's parked in under ground parking im not around to monitor is daily. 
So could I be asking to much of her??

I met him through my best friend Layla (22F), who has been friends with him since they were kids. Layla is engaged and her and Nick have never had feelings for each other. I had just gotten out of a 2-year relationship and Nick told me he loved me after only two weeks of talking. I really liked him and didn’t want him to be a rebound so I had explicitly asked to take things very slow. Him confessing his love so soon caused me to panic so I broke things off. Another reason I was quick to break it off is Nick always expressed he wanted children, and I have always been very vocal about never wanting them.

Me ending the relationship caused a rift in our group friendship because I got back with my ex a few months later, and he did not want me to hang out with Nick. Layla was very uncomfortable being friends with each of us and not being able to hang out together for some time. 

I broke up with my ex (I blocked him), and moved to a different state in August of this year. I have been hanging out with Layla and Nick since even though Layla lives 45 minutes away from me and Nick lives 2 hours away. Recently while we were all together, Nick mentioned he no longer thinks he wants children. This made me realize I still have strong feelings for him, and now have hope it could actually work out.

I told Layla about my feelings and she said that it wouldn’t work out, and I only like him because he’s the only person around. She said I would ruin the friendship again if I hurt him. It bothered me that she said this because I like Nick for a LOT of reasons, not because he’s someone who is around. I feel emotionally ready to move on and Nick is a really great man in my opinion. I know that it would be a big risk to bring up romantic feelings again, but I am having trouble hiding my true feelings and truly believe there’s a good chance our relationship could be incredibly strong. 

Is it too selfish to bring these feelings up regardless of how Layla feels and the possibility it wouldn’t end well? I don’t want to hurt my friends, but I know Nick still has feelings for me and I would have to limit contact for a while until I can figure out how to hide my own feelings for him.

96,1gt10ik,AITA for going to my bsf’s elopement spot before her?,"My bsf got engaged 3.5 years ago. Due to some deaths in her and her fiancé’s families, they postponed wedding planning. About 1yr after their engagement, she told me she wanted to elope at Banff National Park but nothing set in stone. 

For context, she and I are bsf but we are in our early 30s, live in different states, and we don’t talk every day. We have been bff since we were 12 years old. Also, my (now) husband and I travel to Montana multiple times a year b/c we love hiking, the outdoors, adventure. Our regular hobbies revolve around that. We take 1 family trip w/ my husband’s family to Montana, & then one couple trip there. My bsf & her (now husband) are city folks,they do not enjoy those things as a regular past-time. 

In 08/2023, my husband and I went to Montana and we talked about our next trip. We could drive to Alberta, Canada from Montana (only a 5hr drive). We could explore Banff & be able to hike somewhere different. 

Also in 08/2023, my bsf said they were talking about eloping 11/11. That didn’t happen - I don’t know the reason why. 

In 06/2024, we finalized the trip with his side of the family to Montana for 09/24. My husband’s family and he and I agreed to visit Banff for one day. The Banff portion of our trip was booked. 

In 08/2024, my bsf & I talk about if she had chosen a date. She told me 10/12/24. How exciting! I was so happy for them that I was just focused on that.

That’s where my head was at - in celebration of her. I honestly did not even think about my quick day trip to Banff in an entirely different month (Sept.) one time. 

I was not invited to the elopement, and all I knew was Banff on 10/12. I did not know their spot, their plans, anything. And that was ok! It’s their special thing. 

So… what gets us to the am I the asshole part..

I went on my Montana trip & I posted to my stories that the four of us were driving to Canada. My bsf texted me, “are you going to Banff?” And I replied “yes!” And she was pissed. She said how dare I, she feels so slapped in the face, she feels ripped off, she has had this spot planned for literal years.& I didn’t even mention I was going there literally three weeks before she elopes there.  

I did not see that coming at all. I was sad that I had caused her this eruption of emotion and I began apologizing refusely for not seeing it from her point of view. She brought up that I never mentioned anything when we were talking about her elopement. I explained that I wasn’t thinking about my trip when talking about her elopment, it never crossed my mind.  

After a week, she said she felt very backhanded by me for her to find out in social media, that she thought we were better friends than that. She is upset that I didn’t think about it from her point of view. She said this kind of annoyance is the last thing she wants to be dealing with, so she won’t be. 

And since then, my bsf has ghosted me. Despite my apologies, she will not find space in her heart to forgive me. 

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: BSF is abbreviated for best friend. 

EDIT: “gets eloped” isn’t grammatically correct - updated the post for grammar. 

EDIT: I’m seeing a consensus of NTA, but also a few comments that maybe I should have been more deliberate about telling her I was going to go to Banff. 
I was so focused on it being a Montana trip that even when talking about it to friends at work, I forgot to mention the Banff part. It was an honest omission, not a deliberate one.

She is upset that I didn’t think about it from her point of view. She said this kind of annoyance is the last thing she wants to be dealing with, so she won’t be. 

And since then, my bsf has ghosted me. Despite my apologies, she will not find space in her heart to forgive me. 

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: BSF is abbreviated for best friend. 

EDIT: “gets eloped” isn’t grammatically correct - updated the post for grammar. 

EDIT: I’m seeing a consensus of NTA, but also a few comments that maybe I should have been more deliberate about telling her I was going to go to Banff. 
I was so focused on it being a Montana trip that even when talking about it to friends at work, I forgot to mention the Banff part. It was an honest omission, not a deliberate one. Maybe that’s where my fault lies. ",0.0,1.0617986,1,0
