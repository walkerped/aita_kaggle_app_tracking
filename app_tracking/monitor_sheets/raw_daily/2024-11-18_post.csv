0,1guignj,AITA for calling out my friends boyfriends lies?,"I didn't really know how to explain this in the title, there's more to it actually. 

it happened today, but it started like two weeks ago? my friend announced she's in a relationship with a guy she started talking to 4 days before. me and our mutual friend found it weird, but we tried to be happy about it. 

he did many questionable things in a short time, and those are the main characters in my today's story. let's focus on the biggest shit. he told her he won a competition in primary school, and apparently the title is making him exempt from writing like the most important exam in our country's school life. in highschool. 

the thing is, it's not possible. yes, such competition can go that, but I'd attended in highschool. if you won in primary school, then it doesn't matter in high school. why would it? it doesn't make sense. 

so yeah I am not hiding I think he's a liar or he just wants to be so amazing in her eyes but it's just stupid for me. 

another funny thing that the competition was from literature, but she gave him her essay to check it, he rewrote it with so many grammatical errors after he told her her own essay was badly written (it was 100 times better). and then turn out he's dyslectic. so how did he win such a competition? 

so, getting to the drama, she probably told him about me calling him a liar and just laughing at him because I find his actions kind of pathetic, but I don't really know him and those are just jokes in her direction (she often finds herself weird boyfriends). today after school, he approached me and started yelling at me that what I'm saying is bullshit (you can literally google that he's lying) and that I should've talked about him with random people (we gossiped a little with our teacher but besides that no one heard). 

I get why he's mad but I don't understand why he started yelling at me and calling me names and all. and her friends did too. 

so it's okay if she insults my boyfriend (he's trans and she's transphobic) it's perfectly fine, but when I laught that her boyfriend tries so hard to appear more intelligent to be attractive for her I'm fucking rude? 

(sorry if it doesn't make much sense and is rushed, I can answer some questions if something doesn't make sense, but it's late and I'm fucking tired but I won't fall asleep because its bugging me.)

1,1gufevo,AITA for telling my adult son to come back and return this POS birthday gift?,"I (44f) told my adult son (27) that I didn't want any gifts for my birthday. Instead I wanted to get stuff for my youngest son (9) because we just moved across the US to be near my oldest, and could only bring 2 suitcases, and it broke my heart to make him leave all of his belongings.

So I told my oldest son that for my birthday & Christmas, I wanted all the gifts to go to my youngest to rebuild his belongings.

I also had to leave my car so I got an electric scooter to get around (relevant soon).

The plan for my birthday was to put our money together (I put in 2/3 of it) to get my youngest an electric scooter so we can go places together.
I gave him cash and sent him the link to the scooter I had spent many many hours researching, to get the right range/speed etc. at a lower cost, that still had amazing reviews. 

He gave the money to his roommate, who for some reason keeps a savings account for my son, and had his roommate order it. He had asked me if his roommate could do a little digging to see if he could find a better one & I said, ""No! I spent a long time looking & I found the perfect one that suits all of our needs.""

Well, today is my birthday and he came to drop off the scooter and it's not the one I sent him!
The range is lower, the speed is lower, it's made for a child, when I was getting him an adjustable adult scooter so he could grow into it (he's really tall for his age, as well). I'm fuming!!!
I called him and said they sent us the wrong scooter.. and he said, ""No, my roommate pitched in and got a better brand.""

3,1gueqtm,AITA for refusing to go to Thanksgiving because of my mom’s boyfriend?,"My mom Lisa (56F) and I (17F) have a rocky relationship. I’m close with my older brothers, Max (35M) and Alex (30M), but we have different dads. My parents divorced when I was 3, and I’ve never had a stable father figure. My mom remarried when I was 4 to a man who was emotionally abusive and caused me a lot of trauma. They divorced three years ago, which was a huge relief for me.

A few months ago, my mom started dating again. Her first boyfriend, Bobby, was nice, but she broke it off quickly, saying she “never really liked him.” Then she started dating her current boyfriend, Mike, about two months ago. The first time I met him, he handed me the keys to my first car—a car I paid $2,000 for, with the rest from my mom and grandma. It felt weird and awkward, like he was trying to act like a dad.

Mike didn’t make a good impression on my family either. At Max’s recent 35th birthday brunch, Mike spent the whole time talking about himself and his kids, ignoring Max entirely. My mom spends most of her time at Mike’s house now, leaving me to cook and grocery shop for myself. I’ve told her I’m not ready to get to know him because of my trauma from past “father figures,” but she calls me selfish, even though I’ve been in therapy since I was 8.

Now, my mom and Mike are hosting Thanksgiving, but Max and his family aren’t coming because they don’t like Mike. I told my mom I’d rather spend the day with Max and his kids, and she accused me of being selfish and disrespectful. I’ve always wanted a good stable family and spending Thanksgiving with a man I barely know and his children is not my ideal scenario. Especially after spending everything Thanksgiving as a child with my crappy stepdad.

4,1guelqj,AITA for asking my gf to follow through?,"Thanks in advance. The question seems silly, but is part of a broader issue and a bit of a sanity check. I am often in a headspace where I think ""maybe I am a completely unreasonable, narcissistic a\*\* hole and don't even realize it."" 

My gf and I work in tech. There have been times when there was a job or some advice I wanted from a professional, and she had a connection. She usually offers to connect me, then never follows through- even after several reminders. Sometimes it's because she is forgetful. Other times she is protective/nervous that my interaction will reflect poorly on her.

This past week, my partner asked if she could chat with the copywriter on my team for advice. My coworker was on board and sent her cell# to set up a call.

While my gf and I were on a walk, I asked if she chatted with my coworker. She said, ""We are supposed to talk today, but I accidentally signed up for Pilates. I need to tell her I can't today."" *My partner is forgetful and can be flakey.* I responded, ""Just make sure you give her a heads-up soon."" I can't remember her response, but the vibe was: I'm not a kid, I'll handle it. I too care about how my connections reflect on me. I have connected friends with people in the past and have had them flake. It doesn't feel good. Also, I respect that my coworkers are very busy.

Later on, I bring it up again, and things escalate:

Me: ""I just want to ask, if you are going to use my connection, please communicate about when you can talk and follow through.""

R: ""Why are you talking to me like I am 10? I know how to follow up. You already brought this up 3 times on our walk""

Me: ""You asked me to connect you. I am just asking that you respect me and follow through.""

R: ""I don't want to fight about this. It's not a big deal.""

Me: ""I know it's not, I am just making a request. You can just say 'okay.' My coworkers are busy. You have a history of being late or not communicating.""

R: ""When have I not followed through? When am I late?""

*- We are the couple that either flakes last min or shows up 30m late. It's usually because she is trying to fit ALL the stuff in or thinks the event is not important enough to be on time or communicate. This is something we clash on- I value being on time and communicating with people if we are going to be late/flake. This can skew into some rigidity. After 3+ yrs of this, I have begun to throw it back to her as a character flaw, which is not fair- I am working on it.*

Me: ""You are late to stuff a lot. I want to make sure you will follow up, S\*\*\* is a busy person.""

R: ""It's not a big deal, she's like 12."" (my coworker is in her 30s)

Me: ""Why are you so f'ing rude? You are so entitled.""

R: ""I have been working in this industry for 12 years, a lot longer than you. I don't need you to tell me how to be professional. Shut the door.""

That is how it ended. I could have done better. We have been having back a forths like this very frequently over the past few months, and my ability to regulate has severely dwindled.

5,1guegkb,"WIBTA if I (32F) didn't agree to modify a formal dress for my niece (16F), causing her to have to spend a lot of money getting it professionally fitted? ","The situation: My niece, Amy, has been helping out with babysitting her cousin for a couple of hours more or less twice a month for the past two years. However, 4 months ago she decided she no longer wanted to babysit for free. At this point I just figured I'll ask my sister, Jane, to talk some sense into her but to my shock, she actually took me nieces side. Phrases such as ""family is not free labor"" and ""your kid is not my responsibility"" got thrown around. Now, I think they are being incredibly silly. The entire point of family is to have a support system. I understand that not everyone can have that, not everyone has good kind people as family, but as far as I'm concerned that's not us. I was initially just going to do nothing about this because frankly I didn't think this was a situation serious enough to devote any energy to but I ended up changing my mind when Jane got very upset with me that I chose to ask someone else to babysit moving forward, instead of agreeing to pay Amy to do it. 

In the past 4 months the following things have happened: My husband was just ""too busy"" to go help my sister clean the gutters on her house this year. I was all of a sudden ""too busy"" to petsit or host family dinners. My sister started getting annoyed with my newfound business but it became a real fight when I said I was too busy to modify a very nice dress for Amy that she wanted to wear to a wedding. (The dress is a superb quality hand-me-down that's simply too large for her and if I won't agree to take it in they'll have to take it to a tailor.) Jane told me I was being selfish, childish and I was only doing this to prove a point and that I know it would cost way too much to take the dress to an actual tailor (and to be clear, she's not wrong) and to just suck it up and do it. 

Here's where I think I might be an asshole: She's right. I am doing this to prove a point, to her specifically. Amy has actually reached out to me, apologized and offered to resume babysitting if I fixed her dress for her. I told her I'd think about it. I am still incredibly annoyed with my sister. I am proving my point. We do rely on each other a lot, to the extent that me not being ""free labor"" is causing enough of an issue to have a fight about it. She could have apologized at any point and we could have gone back to normal. So, wibta if I refused to budge?

7,1gudxir,AITA for telling my husband that I feel his family don't ,"Sorry this is my first post and English is not my native language, so hang in there. I (28 F) have been married to my husband (32 M) for ten years. We have 2 beautiful children. I get along really well with his family. I always send them photos of our children and call them so they could talk on phone since they live 6 hours away. So, I mean I really don't want to sound toxic or ungrateful... They come to visit once a month (their whole family lives here, it's just them who live far away). Our house is a 20-30 min drive away from where they stay. They always come to our house unannounced. I never complained to them, though I have spoken to my husband to have a word with his mom. They would come late like 11 at night, and would, in occasions wake up our kids. 

I never wanted to make them feel uncomfortable, so I'd always put on a smile and in most occasions, invite them dinner, since because of the drive, they wouldn't eat. My MIL's partner, is really well off. However we never asked them for anything when they would basically invite themselves for dinner. 

So, the thing is, since the beginning of our relationship with my husband, they would always only invite him for dinners and outings. It wasn't till our first child turned around 2, that I had a talk with him telling him I felt his family was leaving my child and I apart. Though they would visit, they would only ask my husband to go to dinner with them. After he talked to his mom, everything cleared up. 

Till this year. So my husband's job is on the way to my MIL's. Everytime they come visit they come to our home unannounced. Then during that weekend, since it's on his way, they always invite only him to their house. The thing is, that it's not just him they invite. They invite my SIL and my MIL's partner's children and grandchildren. It's just my children and I who don't go. However, they all live at a 10-5 min distance, it's just our family who live a bit farther.

I (28 F) have been married to my husband (32 M) for ten years. We have 2 beautiful children. I get along really well with his family. I always send them photos of our children and call them so they could talk on phone since they live 6 hours away. So, I mean I really don't want to sound toxic or ungrateful... They come to visit once a month (their whole family lives here, it's just them who live far away). Our house is a 20-30 min drive away from where they stay. They always come to our house unannounced. I never complained to them, though I have spoken to my husband to have a word with his mom. They would come late like 11 at night, and would, in occasions wake up our kids. 

I never wanted to make them feel uncomfortable, so I'd always put on a smile and in most occasions, invite them dinner, since because of the drive, they wouldn't eat. My MIL's partner, is really well off. However we never asked them for anything when they would basically invite themselves for dinner. 

So, the thing is, since the beginning of our relationship with my husband, they would always only invite him for dinners and outings. It wasn't till our first child turned around 2, that I had a talk with him telling him I felt his family was leaving my child and I apart. Though they would visit, they would only ask my husband to go to dinner with them. After he talked to his mom, everything cleared up. 

Till this year. So my husband's job is on the way to my MIL's. Everytime they come visit they come to our home unannounced. Then during that weekend, since it's on his way, they always invite only him to their house. The thing is, that it's not just him they invite. They invite my SIL and my MIL's partner's children and grandchildren. It's just my children and I who don't go. However, they all live at a 10-5 min distance, it's just our family who live a bit farther.

So I told my husband I felt they always left his family behind. He got angry and said that they just invited him because it's convenient and because it's on his way. So AITA and should chill out, or not?",0.0,0.09099531,0,1
8,1gudtvv,AITA for not letting my Grandmother stay with me after she let me stay with her during the hurricane?,"I have a feeling the animal lovers are going to hate me.

I (31f) stayed with my grandmother (76f) during Milton, as my home was where the hurricane hit. I do not make a lot of money, and I live in a mother-in-law home I rent from her, meaning its a very small space behind a house with only two doors inside: to the bathroom and the closet. There are no other doors in the entire place, everything is open and easily accessible. This is important.

My grandmother is obsessed with her two large dogs. They're boxers, fully grown, very smart, hyper, and destructive. I own a LOT of expensive equipment for work, at least $6k worth, as well as emotional attachments sent by my long distance partner that can never be replaced if lost or destroyed.

She lives a little under 2 hours away, and each time she comes down, she wants to stay the night because shes getting to that age where long drives aren't feasible. I don't really like people coming into my space, but will allow her to stay because she's done so much for me-as long as she gets a dog-sitter and the dogs stay back at her house. She has one, and uses them often to go on mini-trips.

She says these dogs are like her children, and I'm an asshole for forcing her to 'choose' because they make her feel safe and relaxed. Her argument is that 80% of the time when she comes down here, it's for me-being evacuations, family vacations, etc, since I don't drive due to PTSD. I've tried to offer to pay for the sitter, but she ignored the offer.

The thing is, I cannot deal with the labor of keeping these hyper dogs from destroying EVERYTHING. I cannot fit all my valuables into my closet, nor should I have to because I still need to work and its my space I pay for. I don't want to have to dog-proof my house just for a night and have to climb over makeshift barricades of chairs, dressers, etc. She thinks it'd force me to clean my space better (she has OCD), and doesn't see reorganizing my entire small home to be dog friendly as a problem since its so small.

It has been almost a month now and she is still upset at me over not letting her stay, and mentioning that she wanted to stay at the end of this month since we're going on vacation together, but she refuses to leave her dogs at home. I know she does a lot for me, but the last time they stayed got...really tense and ended in a nasty fight, which started the rule.

I am neutral to dogs, I'd even say I like some of them, but her dogs make me neurotic. The entire time they're around, especially in spaces that I'm in, they just start licking me, chewing on my stuff, and try to mow over me or her to get into areas that I've had to make-shift barricades for since...NO DOORS. I'd rather cancel the whole vacation than to let her stay with her dogs for that one night because just the 4 hours caused so much havoc, overnight will probably end our relationship since I'd be on their ass the entire time. So, AITA?

  
EDIT: I'm unsure if this'll work, I apologize if it doesn't. Minus the loads of really mean comments, I did get some great advice and took it. We just finished having a serious talk, and will be looking into booking her a hotel whenever she comes down and needs a place to stay. Yes, I am paying. It seems like shes been wanting to stay longer for personal stuff, but didn't want to take her RV down here and was hoping to ask for 'one more day' until she was done, but my hard no for one night made her realize that wouldn't be an option.

9,1gudths,AITA for involving my friend'e absent father when we were in an argument? ,"I (14 F) have a friend, let’s call him Connor (15 M). Connor and I became close during the second term of the school year, and he was my first real friend when I started high school. He was such a nice guy, always bringing so much life and energy into my social life. I eventually confided a very personal secret to him, and he promised never to tell anyone. However, looking back, I regret sharing it. (I can't say it here bc I don't people finding out who I am). 

One day, during rehearsal for a school play, Connor blurted out my secret in front of everyone, and then tried to cover it up by saying it was an accident. I was angry and didn’t speak to him for two days. Eventually, we patched things up, and it felt like nothing had happened. But soon after that, I started noticing that Connor was getting closer to my opps. For example, when I forgot my lunch money, he would give his lunch to one of my opps instead of me. But when it was the other way around, I would always share my lunch with him.

On sports day, he didn’t have money for lunch, so I spent my last R20 on him so he could buy something to eat. Guess what happened? He gave half of his lunch to his other friend, and that day I had to walk home because I’d spent my last money on him. After that, I stopped doing favors for him unless I got something small in return. He started asking me to do things like changing his books at the locker, even when I had something going on. But he never asked his other friends for help, I said no and he ended up going to his locker by himself lately.

Then, last term, I overheard Connor and one of his friends whispering when I walked into class. This happened repeatedly, and I heard one of them say, “She’s changed,” and that I’ve become “scarce and moody.” A few days later, when I was in the school café buying a snack, I heard the friend he was gossiping with say, “That’s sad,” and Connor followed up with, “It’s not sad, God is punishing her.” My instincts told me they were talking about me, especially since the day before I’d lost my locker keys and told Connor about it.

In that moment, I just snapped. Without thinking, I said something I deeply regret: “Didn’t your father leave you? Maybe that’s God’s punishment for you.” Since then, Connor has stopped talking to me, I understand that, and his friends have been calling me names, saying I’m the asshole for what I said.

I understand why they’re upset, and I totally regret the comment I made. It was mean and unnecessary, and I don’t want to keep things like this with Connor.

12,1guczll,WIBTA if I quit being a scoutmaster for a troop after only being in the role for 6 months? ,"For the past two years, I’ve been involved in Scouting through my kids. I originally stepped up as an Assistant Scoutmaster to help out when our Scoutmaster needed support. About a year ago, he asked if I’d be interested in taking over as Scoutmaster, as he was ready to step back after his kids aged out of the program nearly a decade ago. 

At the time, I wasn’t fully aware of the time commitment required of a Scoutmaster. As an Assistant Scoutmaster, I’d been fairly insulated from the administrative side, so I didn’t fully grasp the demands of the role. 

Let me share some personal context. My wife is an executive for a Fortune 100 company and travels extensively, often Monday through Friday. We have three children: a 21-year-old in college, and two younger kids, ages 14 and 12, who are still at home and need our attention. My career is demanding, and lately, I’ve felt overwhelmed trying to balance everything. During August and September, I was gone almost every weekend for scouting events, and my wife and I barely saw each other. The strain this has put on our marriage and family dynamic is undeniable.

On top of this, the role itself has become increasingly difficult to manage. Our troop shares a committee with another larger troop, and there’s frequent friction over responsibilities. In practice, many tasks—purchasing supplies, coordinating merit badges and rank advancements, scheduling outings, and even managing payments—have fallen solely on me. This isn’t sustainable.

Recently, tensions within the troop have escalated. There’s been infighting among Assistant Scoutmasters, which even led to a shouting match I had to break up during a meeting. Some parents refuse to read communications, then blame me for a lack of information. Others overstep boundaries to the point of violating youth protection guidelines, an issue I’ve escalated to both the committee and council without resolution.

I’ve reached a breaking point. The constant demands of scouting, combined with my career and family responsibilities, have left me no time to focus on my own mental health and well-being. My wife put it best: the moment volunteering stops being personally rewarding is the moment to step away. For me, that moment has arrived. 

With the holiday season approaching and no major events planned until February, I feel this is an appropriate time to resign. The troop has about 30 Scouts, and we’re linked with another troop of 80 Scouts, so there are plenty of Assistant Scoutmasters, registered adults, and committee members who can step up.

While I’ve valued my time as Scoutmaster and the memories I’ve created, I can’t continue in a role that is affecting my mental health, my marriage, and my ability to be present for my children. I hope the troop understands my decision, and I believe my stepping away will open the door for someone else who is better positioned to take on this responsibility.

We all go to the same college and in the same club on campus. We make up the entire executive board of said club. This club has a constitution that we are supposed to follow.

We had been discussing over text message who was presenting what. Elle, the president, seemed to be getting frustrated. During club, Elle said we were going to vote on what to do at the last club meeting. We as an e-board had already discussed and made a decision on what to do for the last meeting. We do not just vote like that in club, we discuss as a group and decide, as per the constitution. She is also supposed to discuss changes with the rest of the e-board before doing anything and she did not. Elle also snapped at me when I mentioned I had downloaded an extension that would allow her to draw directly on the board instead of using the overhead cam to project her iPad (a terrible glare on it and I found the extension and checked that it worked while we were at work that day, specifically so that Elle could use it during the meeting, but she seemed to take my suggestion as an attack).

Afterward, I told Elle we needed to talk about what happened (waited to get home to say this instead of in front of everyone). Elle yelled, ""WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT"" and went to her room and slammed the door hard behind her. This seemed like an overreaction for the situation but I figured she needed some space.

The next day Elle stepped down as president of the club. This seemed like it came out of the blue. But I continued to give her space as she had not yet approached me.

The day after that, she unfriended me on all social media and removed herself from any group chats we were both in. At this point, I was very confused as to how asking to talk about her not following the constitutional rules turned into this.

She met up with our other 2 roommates that day, CeCe and Gina, and they all talked for hours at a cafe. Then they all went out without inviting me along, which is not typical of them. I asked CeCe and Gina if they would tell me anything. Gina ignored me completely and CeCe only said she couldn't tell me.

None of them have spoken to me in days. I did reach out to Elle over text and she ignored it. It’s hard living in an apartment where everyone is mad at me but will not tell me why. This seems like too much to be just a bad day. For her to cut me out completely, there has to be a bigger reason, and I would like to make things righ. I have thought so much on this and I can not pinpoint anything that I could have done that would cause this reaction. It really hurts because one day I have three great friends and the next I feel completely alone and exiled and have no idea why.

I am open to advice (please note that ""reaching out"" and ""waiting it out"" are not great advice as I have one tried that and it's been days, I can't wait it out forever.)

She met up with our other 2 roommates that day, CeCe and Gina, and they all talked for hours at a cafe. Then they all went out without inviting me along, which is not typical of them. I asked CeCe and Gina if they would tell me anything. Gina ignored me completely and CeCe only said she couldn't tell me.

None of them have spoken to me in days. I did reach out to Elle over text and she ignored it. It’s hard living in an apartment where everyone is mad at me but will not tell me why. This seems like too much to be just a bad day. For her to cut me out completely, there has to be a bigger reason, and I would like to make things righ. I have thought so much on this and I can not pinpoint anything that I could have done that would cause this reaction. It really hurts because one day I have three great friends and the next I feel completely alone and exiled and have no idea why.

I am open to advice (please note that ""reaching out"" and ""waiting it out"" are not great advice as I have one tried that and it's been days, I can't wait it out forever.)

While at the bar he said that some drunk girl had asked him for his number and he had responded that he had a girlfriend but he still gave the number (for a friendship). 

This same night he said that his friend was sick and stayed in my partners car and he went over to his friends car that was parked right beside his (a friend of the opposite sex) car to have a drink. Well long story short they all passed out and he fell asleep in the front seat of the car. He swears and says that nothing happened.

Well needless to say let’s just say that I went off on him that it was disrespectful of him to 1. Give that girl his number, that he’s more worried about being nice to other people than he is about hurting or upsetting me and that I essentially gave him an ultimatum to quit drinking and going out or that I’m done.


Some important info to know is that there is a trust issue and has been previous indiscretions.

So am I the asshole who owes him an apology or was i completely justified? How would you have reacted?

In the passed five years however he has been here permanently because he needs a suitable environment for his son to be in during visitation which he cant provide. 

When he returned the last time, a space separate from the the house was created for him because as we learned from the passed he is rather difficult to live with. HOWEVER he now regardless  of having his own space spend most of his time in the house dominating our living space. He spends his time here leaves to his room and I am left to clean his dishes and anything he might leave behind because the house cleaning generally falls on me which I did not mind when it was my mum and I, as we both pull our weight.

He has no friends left as he has borrowed alot of money from them and never returned it. Everyone new he meets doesn't seem to stick around for long. Some of my own friends will not come over anymore because he has made them uncomfortable.

My mum always wants to see the best in him she gets fed up when she is around him to often. I however can see straight through his ""helpful or overly chatty friendly behavior"" and without a doubt he always asks for something. My mum provides everything gives him an allowance as well.

21,1gu99h4,AITA for not returning a gift my ex friend gave me? ,"Last year I moved into a new apartment, it was unfurnished. I went to my friend’s house right after receiving my keys to celebrate. During our conversation she mentions her extra couch and tv in her garage and that she would like me to have it, I insisted that I dont take it and that it was too much. However she insisted right back that I take it, and after a few minutes of a back and forth I finally agreed (wish I didnt) 

Next day comes round, the moving guy helps load the couch and tv into his van and we drive back to my new place and unload it there. I thanked her for giving me the furniture. A few months passed by and me and this friend got into an altercation, and our friendship ended there. 

Few more months pass by, and 2 days ago she sends a mutual friend between us to speak on her behalf, her message consisted of her telling me that the moving truck will be here in a few hours, and that I have to give her back the couch and tv, or pay her for it. (Mind you Ive had the furniture for over a year now) 

I told her no, I will not be giving her the furniture or paying her back, because it was a gift. And I’m not obligated to return to her now that she’s angry at me from our previous altercation before summer started. The altercation itself that happened was because I genuinely needed to cut her off for my own safety, I had many reasons as well as her being disrespectful towards me and the people I love.

Her reaction after I told her that I wouldn’t be giving her the furniture back was to threaten me with calling the police. Which is like…Im not sure what they can do about that lol, but probably nothing. What bothers me now is that shes sending so many people to talk to me on her behalf, Ive been getting calls from “no caller id” numbers and they’re accusing me of stealing the furniture. Im not sure how I would carry a couch and tv on my back and go unnoticed but oh well. 

What worries me is that our friends that we have in common probably heard from her that I “stole her stuff” and I dont really want to go up to each one of them and explain myself. I really dislike how the people she sent are urging me to return her stuff so she could stop bothering me, however this is my dilemma…this person disrespected me, started rumors about me, and threatened me…wouldn’t I be “weak” or “submitting” by returning a gift that she gave to me over a year ago? But also if I didnt, I dont know to what more lengths she’s willing to go.  

Personally, I don’t view the furniture as hers because Ive had it for over a year. And if she had asked me for money back then I would have given it to her. I think its unfair she’s demanding I return the stuff or pay her, a year later. On the other hand I do feel guilty. What are your thoughts? What type of action should I take?

But also if I didnt, I dont know to what more lengths she’s willing to go.  

Personally, I don’t view the furniture as hers because Ive had it for over a year. And if she had asked me for money back then I would have given it to her. I think its unfair she’s demanding I return the stuff or pay her, a year later. On the other hand I do feel guilty. What are your thoughts? What type of action should I take? ",0.0,0.9633468,1,0
22,1gu92x8,AITA for yelling at my boyfriends dad? ,"So my(22f) boyfriend(37m) has a large family.I just bought my first home, and my boyfriend (we will call him Cody) has been doing all the renovations. It was a unique situation where we bought the entire estate at a great price. Most of the stuff we haven’t made a decision on what we are keeping versus getting rid of. We have had the house for a month and a half, and for the most part our priority is renovations and getting out of the apartment. Since getting the house I have told all of his family if they would like to check things out just let us know. Most of the things in the house we are open to getting rid of aside from a few things we have set aside. For reference, we got two bed sets, about 20 TV’s, the entirety of all cooking necessities, everything other than food and clothes. Another important thing to note is Cody’s large family has a habit of just showing up places without invitation or warning, which I have expressed lots of concern with because I do not do well with unexpected visitors. So Cody’s dad, we will call him bob (64m), has been coming and working on the house most days, and sometimes we leave him by himself because he’s getting paid and we had a birthday party from my family to go to. Bob has a tendency to do things his way and there has been multiple times I have had to set boundaries because I ask him multiple times to stop and he continues, which is disrespectful to me and my home I worked hard for. For example, I spent hours cleaning the furniture that was here because we are going to sell it, and after I asked him to stay away from the garage while smoking, he stood 5 feet away from the couches inside the garage I had just cleaned but because he was “outside the garage, didn’t think it would be an issue”. He has a habit of pushing boundaries. So the day we were gone for this birthday party, we come back to the house where bob was, and one of Cody’s brothers, Bobby (42 m) and his girlfriend Sharon (around the same age, F) were in my driveway talking to bob, asking how much I wanted for miscellaneous things in the garage. When we pulled up I looked at Cody and asked him to deal with it. After about 10 minutes, Bob walked up to the car and said Sharon wants to know how much I want for XYZ, things I was planning to keep that are separate from everything else. I end up yelling at Bob asking him why the hell there were people at my house without mine or my boyfriends knowledge, and he just kept saying “it’s his brother I thought it would be fine”. Mind you, Bobby has a habit of taking things that do not belong to him and then “forgetting” he took them. After yelling, Bobby and Sharon left without a problem and Bob didn’t talk to me the rest of the night. Now according to Cody, Bob hasn’t slept in 2 days because he’s so stressed about me yelling at him, Bobby told the whole family what happened, and everyone is mad at me because I’m trying to “keep Cody from the family”. AITA?

23,1gu8ydn,AITA for asking my husband to have his cat euthanized?,"My husband has a cat that is 20 years old. 
The past three years, this cat has driven me insane with his middle of the night yowling and disgusting behaviors. 
These include:
Peeing on our bed requiring a new mattress, peeing in laundry baskets filled with clothes, going into the dryer and peeing on a batch of clothes, peeing on any fabric/article of clothing left in a room he does not frequent, requiring me to tediously ensure all doors are closed at all times in the homes, pooping wherever in the house when he doesn’t want to use the doggy door, turning my outdoor box gardens into giant litter boxes. 
We’ve allowed his space to be in our office which has a couch for him to sleep on. We covered it with a blanket to protect it. The blanket is just completely covered with hair, and of course the couch is as well now, along with stinky grease from this geezer cat and dried throw up on both the blanket and couch. 
My husband doesn’t see this as an issue, and has refused to clean it stating he’ll just throw the blanket away when the cat dies. But this vomit has been there for months! And this room stinks and just turns my stomach whenever I need to be in there.  My husband will also at times leave cat throw up on the floors for a week at a time, and will just laugh when eventually the dog or cat eats it.
I don’t want to live in a house where it’s “normal” for dried cat vomit to be on the couch for months, or where I have to accept that my clothing or my bed can be peed on if I accidentally leave the house with my bedroom door open, or where I cannot have a garden because a geezer cat fills it with his piss and toxoplasmosis riddled shit.

I’m so sick of this, and my husband doesn’t see the issue, and acts as if I am irrational for drawing attention to it! As of yesterday, I threw away the soiled blanket and couch covers, and have banished the cat from the office, and told my husband the cat can sleep in the living room and that’s it. But he’s upset at me saying the cat will just ruin our couch out here. 
He doesn’t realize that maybe you should clean up after your animal regularly? Not allow an animal to destroy furniture? 
 I’ve been tolerating this for years, and I’m just so done. I’ve also asked my husband if he could have the cat euthanized - He is old, not in the best health anyways, and with these behaviors that have been worsening I just don’t want to live like this any more. He also regularly wakes us up in the middle of the night with his night yowling, as he has feline dementia.

26,1gu8804,AITA for my argument with my mom over my room?,"
So I (18F) have an issue. I have a brother (18M), has pretty mad mental health and bad depression. My mom (43F) has been struggling with helping and coming up with solutions. Currently, he is in a room that has no sunlight. The room is big, perfect for all of him gaming equipment and drawing stuff. 

My mom pulled me aside the other day because he has been getting worse. He works in fast food and his coworkers have been bullying him.. It’s really taking a toll on him. She said she is thinking about letting my brother take my room. My room is on the same floor (the basement), with one window. I have spent hours decorating it, painting, buying a new light fixture, and overall making it my own place. 

 I have a boyfriend (18M) that I spend a ton of time with. I go to the gym with him regularly after work 3 days a week and then I go to his house. I most of the time make plans with him over the weekend. He is honestly my soulmate. I have my own car that I completely pay for, insurance, maintenance, gas, so rides aren’t a problem. But ultimately, I do spend more time at his house. On the days I have off, Monday and Friday I spend at home. We all have “chore days”. Mondays and Fridays are my days, and I try to do a pretty good job. 

I have a good job that pays well, and pays for my college. I’m the only child that has there license and own car. I do not drink or smoke. I pay for a lot of own things.I have been really trying to maintain all my relationships at home as well (not mention yet- dad 45M, sister 17F). On the days I am with my boyfriend, I come home first to talk with everyone home before I go over. I also pay rent, but honestly it’s really low compared to apartment prices. 

My siblings are sometimes resentful of me for being gone so much, because they think I’m not contributing to the house as much as they are.I help out with rides to school, practices, work regularly. They seem to be mad that I’m allowed to “do as I please”. My mom agrees with them, but also says to me that it’s completely fine, that I’m an adult. But, she said in her argument about my room that “I do not really live here” and that “ I really only sleep here”. She doesn’t think I put a lot of effort into the household and doesn’t think it’s fair to everyone else here that “I have a glorified storage unit”. I honestly got mad at that. There is another room upstairs with a lot more lighting but she said it’s not enough room. She said that I’m taking it too personally and she only said she’s “thinking about it” and that she doesn’t think it will happen until next year because of the busy holidays. 

I just want some honest opinions on this situation, and I completely understand if I’m the asshole.

I‘m currently the one primarily managing bedtime and the (many, frequent) night wakings and I am still breastfeeding A LOT. Especially at night. I had initially thought to wean shortly after baby turns one but I’m not so sure now because honestly, it’s such a magic trick to calm baby down when sick or whiny and it’s also such a beautiful, bonding thing to me. Not that it matters too much because it’s between me and baby but my partner is supportive to continue as long as it feels right because he too has been nursed until he was 2 (consider culture here please, we‘re not in nor from the US). 

Anyway… by next spring baby will be 15+ months, so maybe things will be a bit different. But right now the idea of being away from baby for 4 days/ 3 nights feels impossible. I think I’d worry constantly that baby (then toddler to be fair) would miss me and be sad. I don’t think I would enjoy it at all.

Lexia and Astrid are people who think they are on top of the world (popular) and they think that they can just rule over everyone. So I came home crying and my Stepfather thought there was smth seriously wrong with me. I asked for a mental health day so I can recover some of my sanity and trauma, and he was completely oblivious to the fact that I'm a depressed, socially anxious freak who needs it. I'm failing a class in school, and he said that I would ""fall behind"" if I missed, which I knew exactly what would miss, and I could make it up once I've recovered. He just yelled at me and said that it was my phone that was the problem and how I just need to be happy to get rid of my depression. (WHICH OBV ISNT POSSIBLE)",4.0,0.010266754,0,0
30,1gu6ko7,AITA for suggesting to be late to help my friend move apartments?,"A close friend of mine will be moving out of his parent's home next month and asked a bunch of people to help with moving - about 10 people volunteered, including his parents and himself. We all voted on a weekend, set a date on a Saturday and waited for more info. He's moving out from the town both of us grew up with to the city where I live; it's about an hour for me by public transport to his parent's house.

Yesterday he wrote into the group chat and asked to all assemble at his parent's house at 8am. To get there at 8am I'd have to get up at 6:30am. I suggested that instead I could wait at arrival point at 9am to help carry furniture and boxes up into his new apartment. At the time I didn't think it was a big deal, so I communicated lightly, offering to bring an electric drill too because I have one lying around. He said that he'd prefer me to be there at 8am. I texted him in private and said that that's really early for me and I'd prefer to join at arrival point. He reacted angrily, telling me I might as well not bother if that's my perspective - but that he'd be sure to remember it next time I'd need help.

I was surprised, and texted that I'm a little shocked by this, that I think it's normal to compromise with people when asking for help. The shock quickly turned into hurt, so I told him that reading such an angry text made me quite sad, and carefully explained my position. I really did want to help, and this was not a request out of laziness. I'm not a morning person, and getting up this early would make me feel sick all day and result in me having a complete breakdown at the end (physically can't sleep before 1am). I also apologized for communicating so lightly about it in the beginning. I reiterated that I'd really love to help moving and get there at arrival point, spend the rest of the day helping with the move. And finally asked for a call if he had time, as I didn't want to leave this unresolved.

He did not call, instead saying that yes, he was frustrated because he felt like I didn't wanna help. He said he wants me there at 8am but I'd obviously not be expected to carry everything or work without a break. I feel that he missed the point there a bit. I asked him why he would like me to be there at 8am instead of joining a little later. Getting up this early really is a boundary for me.

He texted me again this morning. Completely dodged my question, instead saying that he's asked me three times now to show up at 8am. Telling me he sees how my priorities lie and to not bother showing up. He also told me to think about my priorities and my wrongdoing here.

So: what do you think? AITA in this situation?

TLDR: I live in the city, my friend's moving here from an hour away. He wants me to be at his at 8am, I'd prefer to join at 9am at arrival point because that wouldn't kill me with sleep deprivation (not a morning person at all...).

31,1gu6fmy,AITA kung never ko ng kikibuin ang roommate ko? ,"For context, it's a 2 bedroom condo unit. My one roommate occupied one room since her parents visits and stays from time to time and ang isang room ay occupied namin with bunkbed. Since this is my 1st time na mag-dorm, hindi naman ako nahirapan mag-adjust sa mga kasama ko kasi mababait naman sila, total strangers pala kami sa isa't isa, dito na lang sa dorm nagkakilala. However, yung nakakasama ko sa room ang hindi ko na alam paano ko pa pakikisamahan. Since kami ang magkakasama, hindi maiiwasan ang hiraman. 

Unang hiniram sa akin ay payong, I'm very strict when it comes sa mga gamit ko pero bilang ""pakikisama"" I lend it to her, may tiwala ako eh. Kinabukasan, dahil need ko gamitin, tinanong ko yung nanghiram ko na roommate kung nasan na yung payong ko, ending naiwan niya daw don sa friend niya (never ko na nakuha and hindi rin pinalitan, ako pa ulit bumili ng payong ko). 

Next incident, may pagka-OCD kasi ako sa gamit and very matalas ang mata sa arrangements ng mga gamit ko so alam ko kapag may nagagalaw sa mga gamit ko. Napapansin ko na yung stock kong detergent powder ay parang nababawasan and ang natitira na lang sa lalagyan is yung sachet, so I asked again my roommate kung kumukuha ba siya, sabi niya yung may bawas lang naman yung ginagamit niya (w/c is nakakainis kasi naubos niya na pero hindi pa itapon yung sachet sa trash bin). 

Midterm exam week is over, wala pa akong regular class kaya umuwi muna ako sa amin for 4 days. Wala kaming kitchen cabinet kaya ang mga stocks ko ay nasa open shelves lang, tanda ko pa lahat ng stocks na nabili ko kasi bago ako umuwi sa amin nakapamili na ko, meron akong pancit canton na natirang 3. Pagbalik ko dito sa dorm baket isa na lang. Una kong tinanong yung roommate kong may solo room, sagot hindi siya mahilig sa noodles and may sarili siyang stocks sa room niya kaya hindi siya, then I asked yung roommate ko mismo, sabi niya kumuha daw siya nung di pa nakakabili ng bigas pero papalitan naman daw niya nalilimutan niya lang. (Kota na siya sakin neto pero sige nagtitimpi pa ko).

Last and pinaka triggered point ko, Saturday night, lalabas siya and mukang umaga na makakauwi so hiniram niya yung susi ko (since di pa siya nakakapagpa-duplicate ng kanya) and my shoes. Since nagpaalam naman kaya pinahiram ko. Kinabukasan, nay kumakatok, guess what? Syempre si roommate, since ako ang nagbukas ng door, hiniritan niya me agad ng ""ate sorry naiwan ko sa friend ko yung susi, magpapa-duplicate na lang ako"". Hindi na ako umimik, dahil baka may masabi lang akong hindi maganda. Afternoon came, I need to run some errands kaso yung shoes na gagamitin ko na HINIRAM ng friend ko, madumi and halos masira na yung takong (sobra na akong inis dito pero dahil tulog siya tinuloy ko muna yung lakad ko). Pagkauwi ko, naabutan ko siya sa sala, hindi ko kinibo at tinignan pero sinundan niya ko sa room and nagtanong kung san ako nagpa-duplicate ng susi ko, dun na ako nagsalita pero malumanay pa din may pagpipigil pa din. Sinabi ko na hindi ko na alam paanong pag aadjust pa gagawin ko sa pakikisama sa kanya. 

I'm not used to this, lalo na at nakakasama ko pa 24/7. I want to be the bigger person pero naabuso lang ako. Hindi ako madamot pagdating sa gamit lalong lalo na sa pagkain kaya hindi ako nagtatago sa cabinet and madali lang din ako magtiwala kasi ayaw kong pinag iisipan ng masama ang kasama ko pero parang nagkamali pa yata ako.

32,1gu6cbf,AITA for telling my older sister that I dont want to babysit her anymore?,"English is not my first language

So I (F18) have a sister (21). Four years ago she started to have issues with her thyroid. I dont know the details, but I know that she often passed out in school, as a result of her medical condition. She developed a deep depression and even when her condition got better after a surgery her depression remained. Even when she got a therapist.

She graduated in 2023 and has been at home ever since. She doesnt work and doesnt seek further education. She just sits in her bed all day. She also refuses to do any chores, except for feeding some of our pets.

I graduated in July 2024. I am also still at home, but I work a part-time job and I am studying to get my drivers lisence. I plan on going to university in late spring. But even with my jobs I spend more time at home than I used to. Thats why I took over most of the chores. My father works full-time and doesnt come home before 7pm. My mother used to work full-time but now reduced her hours to help out with my sister.

I also have to take care of her. I have to get her to wake up (that sometimes takes 2-3h), I have to make sure that she eats properly, I try to motivate her to do at least some chores and I have to check on her frequently. She also tries to get my attention for hours by stealing my things and running off, by jumping on my bed and refusing to leave, by smearing my door with soap and toothpaste, by waking up my hamster, etc. I normally react to all that calmly, because I know how she really feels. But I started to get more angry with time, because its just incredibly childish and I dont know how to stop her. She also doesnt leave the house alone. When she wants to go shopping I have to go with her and she constantly begs for me to do things with her. Most of the times I give in.

Her depression is very predictable. A few weeks everything goes great and then after some time (mostly before doctors appointments/ meetings with her therapist) she has a break down. She was send to two clinics for that and when It happened again a week ago she was sent to a third. Monday she got in and Tuesday she was in tears, already demanding to leave. Not a week later they are legally not allowed to keep her any longer. 

This happened before. She shows everyone how bad she has it, then everyone moves earth and sun for her to get proper help and there she refuses to get any help and just demands to leave as soon as possible.

My mom and I have to pick her up today from the last clinic. She called me earlier telling me the news. And I told her that I dont support her decision and that her behaviour is unfair for anyone who worries about her and tries to help her. She tells me that this time it wont be like the other times, but she promised that multiple times already and the next time she wont get into a better clinic. We got into an argument and a few minutes in I got really angry and told her that I dont want to babysit her anymore. Now shes calling me an a-hole

33,1gu6a07,AITA for telling my pregnant friend I can’t stand her complaining anymore? ,"I want to start off by saying that I (F29) am 7 months pregnant myself. My friend Cassie (25F) is also pregnant, and about 7 weeks ahead of me. 

At first it was awesome being pregnant together— we’d vent about things, talk about how excited we are, plan mommy-to-be dates, etc. But now her attitude has been rubbing me the wrong way and I can’t stand talking to her about it anymore. 

She’s gone from occasional venting to texting me upwards of 5 times a day about every horrible symptom she has. What bothers me is that I also have a lot of the same irritating pregnancy symptoms, but when I try to sympathize she pulls the “oh just WAIT until you’re at _____ weeks!” card as if it’s some strange competition. 

So I dropped the sympathy angle and decided to just send her positive messages instead. But she totally sidesteps my attempts at positivity or my suggestions and complains about something else. For example, if I suggested a medicine I took for heartburn she’d reply “no I’ll just throw it up.” If I tried to suggest that she take some time off work because she’s clearly unhappy, she’d reply “I can’t I don’t have enough sick days.” Which is fair, I guess, but it gets old very quick being shot down over and over. She ignores all my upbeat messages about staying strong and that she’s almost there and that she can do it and replies with “I’m miserable” instead. 

What pushed me over the edge is she also stopped asking me about my pregnancy completely. Never checks in with me, never asks about my baby, and when I try to share anything positive she hardly acknowledges it. I went from feeling like we were in this together to feeling like she is the only pregnant one. I finally snapped when she texted me about her swollen ankles for the 20th time and said that I’m already anxious enough with my own due date creeping up and that her negativity is ruining my own pregnancy. I told her that I’m not feeling great either, but I’m not sending her lists of ailments every morning and I suggested she start venting to her husband instead. 

I obviously hurt her feelings— she read it and hasn’t spoken to me since. I feel completely justified, but my husband said I shouldn’t have said anything, that she’s “clearly struggling more”, and that I should just basically treat her with pity because she’s so unhappy. I think she’s a total downer and I don’t need that energy weighing me down, but now I’m wondering if I’m being insensitive because she is so close to giving birth and clearly having more complications than I am.

I do feel like the way i changed was odd because i went from everyday being lovey dovey to kinda cold, never wanting to talk about my feelings. keep in mind he was in love with me and as was I until my life was falling to crap, i did always check up on him and i tried to say ""i love you too"" whenever he would say it but it was just too hard of me to add some cute nickname at the end.

One night he told me to get onto Vrchat {a game we play all the time} so i did. we 'talk' a little about dumb thing but most the time just sat there not doing much, it felt off and it felt like i did something wrong. After a while he asked to talk to me and of course I said yes because i'm the type of person to not let people bottle up their feelings. He then started going on about how the way i changed hurt him and how the ""old me was better"" and he ""missed the old me"".

See i had already been going through a hard time and i already thought the old me was better but every time i talked to him he said he loved me no matter what and that the old me wasn't better so hearing this broke me. He told me that he never lets his problems change how he acts and that pissed me off because i was trying so hard to be a good friend to him and be a good person but him saying that broke something in me.

I told him I hadn’t done my registration yet but would try to this week. Jimmy told me I should join a certain class because Ben (19m) would be in it and I could try to ask him out.

For context, a couple months earlier, Ben (a friend of Jimmy’s) had hit on me a couple times and I rejected him but eventually I asked if he wanted to grab coffee which he agreed to. However, we cancelled and never ended up rescheduling. Right after this I started talking to Anthony (18m) and I have really started to like him. So when Jimmy suggested this, I told him I’d check out the class but I wasn’t interested in Ben since Anthony and I are talking so much. Jimmy kept pressing and asking “even if Ben asked you out you would say no?” and I kept replying “I’m really not interested in Ben so I’m not going out with him.”

We get in the club and Jimmy is clearly in a bad mood being tense to our friends and just acting weird. At one point, Jimmy looks at me and asks “If you and Ben were in the same class together do you think you would have a hard time being professional with him?” This catches me off guard and I ask why that would be an issue. Jimmy goes on to tell me since I had a “thing” with Ben it may be difficult for me to work closely with him without getting emotional. This gets me really pissed and I keep reiterating I’m not into Ben and my personal and school/work life are two separate things entirely. I told him if anyone made it unprofessional it sure as hell wouldn’t be me not to mention I am already interested in someone else.

On top of all this, the field I’m studying is male dominated making this comment more offensive to me because I don’t think Jimmy would ask that kind of question to a guy. I would’ve said more to Jimmy in the moment had we not been in such a busy space (especially considering he was interested in a classmate but it didn’t work out) but I think going back and trying to retroactively talk with him may make things worse. I’m also very bad when it comes to confrontation and tend to bottle things up best I can. I feel like I may be overreacting about the whole thing since I doubt he meant it to come across that way but I’m really bothered. My friends all sided with me but I want outside opinions. So am I overthinking this?",Not the A-hole,2024-11-18,"AITA for being offended by my guy friend questioning my professionalism?

37,1gu44wv,AITA For not correcting my friend’s boyfriend on their pronouns?,"
One of my best friends started dating a guy a couple weeks ago and he keeps misgendering them and calling them “she”. My friend has asked me a few times if I would message him and correct him or if I would correct him in person if and when we’re all together. 

ETA: my friend is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns

At this point I never met my friend’s boyfriend and I said I didn’t know him and didn’t feel comfortable messaging him to correct him and told my friend that this has to be a conversation that they have to have with him and be comfortable to continue having. 

I met their boyfriend once and he kept referring to them as “she” and when he was in the bathroom my friend said my boyfriend or I needed to correct him for them because they were scared. I said I don’t know him and if it were one of my friends I would gladly correct him but I don’t know him and it just felt weird to do so. My boyfriend said the same. We have both corrected our friends and family members when it comes to my friend’s pronouns but we just felt like it was my friend’s responsibility to have this conversation with their boyfriend. My friend was visibly bothered but stopped asking and definitely was off for the rest of the night. 

Since then my friend did have the conversation with him and he doesn’t have a problem with their gender identity or using their correct pronouns but now they’re asking that if the boyfriend still misgenders them when we’re all together if I would correct him. I feel like an AH for wanting to say no snd my friend hasn’t outright said it but I can tell they are clearly bothered that I have been telling them I will not correct him. Since they’ve asked me again I haven’t responded to their message yet, but I just don’t know their boyfriend and if he were someone I introduced to my friend or someone I personally knew then I feel like it would be a different story and I wouldn’t mind.

39,1gu3d5m,AITA for not apologising to my brother after he missed my birthday,"I (30f) have always loved celebrating my birthday. My parents were not amazing parents but my Mum always made sure on our birthdays a big deal was made.

I got married quite young (21) and didn't have a lot of money at the time so our wedding was very cheap, it was even BYO. I still loved it but always regretted not being able to pay for a big meal for everyone. So for my 30th, because I'm in a way better financial position, I wanted to do something where I paid for everyone's food and drink and we all had fun. 

I told everyone about it months in advance as I had to pre pay for the venue and let them know about catering. It got to a month before my birthday and my brother (26m) hadn't RSVPd yet so I messaged him to ask. He said that he wouldn't be coming as him and his girlfriend had just bought a puppy and could not leave the puppy unattended that long. I responded asking him if there was no one else that could look after the dog to which he responded the dog was ""his responsibility not anyone elses"". 

I explained to him how upset I was as it felt like he wasn't even trying to come. He said he didn't see what the big deal was and I always make him uncomfortable by guilting him about stuff like this. For context, I have gotten mad at him before for not attending my son's birthday party and not letting me know he wasn't coming. We argued a bit about other history thats not relevant. What made me mad more than anything was his complete inability to empathise. He made me feel like I was being the difficult one for being upset with him. 

5 years ago I would have lost it and told him to get out of my life forever but I've done a lot of therapy in that time and I simply said I wasn't going to let him make me feel bad for having a valid response to my own brother missing an important birthday to me. I said I needed a break from talking to him so I could enjoy my birthday and I loved him. We left it at that. 

It's been 6 months, it is now coming up to my sons birthday and I sent him an invite as I don't believe in withholding my kids from someone because I'm mad, my parents did that a lot. He hasn't responded and when my Mum asked him if he was coming he said he was waiting on a conversation with me first. 

In my family that means I will be the one that has to call and he will expect me to apologise for being upset with him or he won't come to my son's birthday. He is more stubborn than I am so it will have to be the way it goes for him to come. AITA if I just don't apologise and continue the stalemate?

EDIT: For those saying I'm upset over parties, it's not the party I'm upset about. If he had offered to do something else with me instead or even have me over to meet his dog and watch a movie I honestly wouldn't have been upset.

The whole cutting people my life over petty stuff is to do with highschool friends and a couple of aunts where I acknowledged I was doing the wrong thing so went to therapy to change that. 

I have never acted that way with my brother, my parents divorced when he was 12 and wouldn't stay in the same room together so I went to his Deb, graduation, sporting games to support him as I wanted him to have someone consistent in his life. The ""irrelevant history"" was us arguing over who was stuck between my parents more which we both agreed by the end of it that we had veered off track. 

The ""guilting him"" about my son's party was simply that I cried when we spoke about it which made him feel uncomfortable, I ended up apologising for crying which is why I say I'm afraid to apologise this time as I'm so used to apologising for having emotions which I don't think is healthy for me

We’re all college juniors. Sasha and Harry have been friends since freshman year, but Sasha and I became close last fall (2023). Our growing friendship caused tension, as Harry, who has feelings for Sasha, grew jealous and insecure.

Harry has a reputation for lying and badmouthing people. Most of our extended circle avoids him, but Sasha remains unaware because he presents himself well to her. Before Sasha and I became friends, Harry often badmouthed her to me and others, accusing her of leading guys on, using people, and seeking attention. None of this is true—Sasha has been single and genuine. After Sasha rejected Harry’s romantic confession, he escalated the insults but stopped involving me when he realized Sasha and I were friends. I called him out when he tried again, and he stopped talking to me about her directly.

As my friendship with Sasha deepened, Harry’s behavior toward me became passive-aggressive. He badmouthed me to mutual friends, who told me about it. When I confronted him, he denied everything and insisted he wasn’t bothered by my friendship with Sasha, but his actions told a different story. Over time, I distanced myself from him completely.

This semester, things escalated. Harry accused me of “stealing” Sasha from him. During an argument, he apologized for the “misunderstanding” but refused to take responsibility. Instead, he turned on Sasha, calling her manipulative and claiming she befriended me just to provoke him. I defended her and cut Harry off entirely. This came at a cost: I lost mutual friends, had to quit a student organization, and became more socially isolated.

I told Sasha I cut Harry off due to “multiple issues” but didn’t reveal the awful things he said about her. I didn’t know if it was my place or if I’d damage her trust in me by sharing. Still, it’s been hard staying close to her, knowing what I know and feeling like I’m hiding something.

Recently, Sasha and Harry have grown closer again while she’s grown distant from me. We’ve gone from talking daily to her only reaching out for academic help. She’s been cold and dismissive, which makes me suspect Harry has been badmouthing me to her. Others have confirmed he continues spreading rumors, and I strongly believe he’s poisoned her opinion of me.

Now, I feel the need to tell Sasha everything—Harry’s lies, insults, and how he’s shared her private confidences. I feel like I can’t look her in the eye unless I come clean. But I’m terrified it will destroy the little connection we have left. Harry’s influence over her seems so strong now that it feels like our friendship never mattered.

41,1gu2z1a,AITAH (or would I be) for not inviting my fiancé’s family to our wedding?,"I haven’t pulled the plug on any decision, but im seriously considering to not invite any of my fiancés family to our wedding ceremony. 

Let me back up - I’ve been with my soon to be husband for almost 10 years and I’m very close to his family, especially his mom and both of his grandmas. I have great relationships with all of them and I talk to them more than my fiancé does. They’ve done nothing but welcome me to the family since day 1. My future MIL helped my fiance pick out my dream ring and she goes above and beyond for us when we need anything. For all of this, I am beyond grateful. With all that said, I’m leaning towards them not being at our wedding. 

Why? I’m a nutshell: I am not close at all with my family and it’s very unfortunate. I grew up with emotionally immature and stunted parents who prioritized their own happiness over their children’s well being. (Un)Shockingly, this did not manifest into good or healthy parent-child relationships when we (me and my siblings) entered adulthood. I have 6 siblings, and we all have shitty relationships with one another. My mom hates my fiancé (even though he’s done more for me in the 10 years together than she ever has) and my father is completely indifferent about anything going on my life. Neither of them congratulated me about the engagement when it happened and I have yet to hear anything from my siblings. 

My fiancé’s family wants a formal ceremony (he’s the baby and his mother’s only son). I’m paralyzed on moving forward with anything. I’d rather it just be him and I. The idea of having a ceremony with only his family and none of mine is heartbreaking. I’d feel selfish for not allowing his family to witness their son/grandson get married, but at the same time, I don’t know if I can emotionally deal with not having anyone in my family in attendance. I feel like a loser.

(Un)Shockingly, this did not manifest into good or healthy parent-child relationships when we (me and my siblings) entered adulthood. I have 6 siblings, and we all have shitty relationships with one another. My mom hates my fiancé (even though he’s done more for me in the 10 years together than she ever has) and my father is completely indifferent about anything going on my life. Neither of them congratulated me about the engagement when it happened and I have yet to hear anything from my siblings. 

My fiancé’s family wants a formal ceremony (he’s the baby and his mother’s only son). I’m paralyzed on moving forward with anything. I’d rather it just be him and I. The idea of having a ceremony with only his family and none of mine is heartbreaking. I’d feel selfish for not allowing his family to witness their son/grandson get married, but at the same time, I don’t know if I can emotionally deal with not having anyone in my family in attendance. I feel like a loser.

The next couple of days she didn’t try to reach out to me and we didn’t talk. That following weekend I reached out to her asking if we’re broken up and she said yes and to ultimately leave her alone to which I did until last week when she reached out asking if we could meet and have a talk with each other.

43,1gu28o4,WIBTA for setting quiet hours with my roommates? ,"I've (24f) been living with my friend (24f) and her boyfriend (28m). We live in a 2b2bth appartment. I work full time, 7:30-4pm monday to friday. My friend works part time in the evening. Her boyfriend does not work. When we first moved in, they would be up in the kitchen around 2-5 am and it would wake me up. My friend would be apologetic about it but it is usually her boyfriend making noises.. I don't have direct contact with her boyfriend, he does not want to talk to me so all communications goes through my friend. I've asked her if we can maybe have quiet hours from 12-7am just on weekdays so I'm not tired for work but I never get a clear answer. I just took it as they didn't want to and never brought it up again. However, I notice my friend would start asking me when I'm planning to sleep on some days bc she wants to make sure it's not too loud for me. She always ask me this on a weekend even thought I've emphasized I don't care about noises on weekends, just weekdays when I have work. She doesn't reply to this. 

For the past month, I've been woken up by her boyfriend making food and I haven't say anything. I would wait it out or just bury my head and go back to sleep. However, I noticed he's been getting bolder, staying in the kitchen for longer and just overall making more noises in the mid of night. I am not sure why he waits until mid night to start making food when he is home 24/7. At this point, I've already ask my friend to quiet down so many times and I can tell she does not want to restrict her boyfriend. I know it is their right to use the kitchen whenever they want but I feel like they're not constricted by working hours. I've looked for similar posts online and the general consensus is I would be the asshole but I'm wondering if it could be situational and if I should push harder for the quiet hours. 

Edit since everyone keeps telling me to talk to the boyfriend. He does not want to speak to me because my friend confided in me when they almost broke up a few times. And he didn't ""realize"" until we already signed the lease and moved in together. She told me this literally the second day of our living together.

49,1gu13w9,AITA for not paying for my girlfriend's haircut?,"Hi everyone. My girlfriend (32f) and I (38m) have been together for two years. I lost my job about three months into our relationship. During this time, she really came through for me and helped out A LOT. I did not have a car so she would help me deliver orders on Doordash and Grubhub so I could pay my bills. She also covered the difference out of her pocket if I was running short. To say I'm grateful to her is an understatement. 

I finally found a new job two months ago. I'm saving up for a car so she's been letting me borrow hers. She accrued some debt while I was out of a job and I have repaid about half of that. However, now I'm worried that she's starting to only want me for my money.

We got into an argument over the weekend because she called to ask me if she could borrow some money to get a haircut. Apparently she is running short due to an expected home repair cost, but already paid the hairdresser a deposit that she would have to forfeit if she rescheduled it. I had a long day at work and was exhausted, both mentally and physically. So when I noticed that my phone was ringing, I was really excited to see her name. But after I answered, she immediately asked me for money. I felt crushed because she did it without even asking how my day was first. I told her that I guess I understand what my new role is in her life now and she threw a huge fit about it.

She claims that she ""gave me her everything"" for a year and a half just to keep a roof over my head, and that she's accrued debt from when I wasn't working so I shouldn't be so opposed to doing her a favor. I recently bought her car a new set of tires and got the brake pads replaced, as well as gave her some money to repay the debts with. I also have paid for the car payment and insurance since I started working because I have it at my place more than she does while I save up to buy my own. So it's not like I don't contribute to her expenses already.  She keeps guilt tripping me because ""a haircut is a small ask considering everything I've done for you"" which feels very controlling. Now she won't talk to me and I'm scared that she's going to breakup with me without even hearing me out.

I hated taking her money when I was jobless and that I have to use her car now, I didn't want to do it in the first place. Anytime I needed her to pay for something, it was because it was an important expense like my rent or power. So the way she is asking for something unnecessary like a haircut just feels like a slap in the face.

I haven’t had any issues with her but I’ve noticed that she is kind of jealous?? (She once got really angry with my brother because he accidentally called me sweetheart, which is how he usually refers to her), I don’t know but I think this is important later. 

Now, to the actual situation. I visited this past weekend, and there was this event my brother wanted to take me. 5 tickets were needed, for my brother, me, SIL, and two friends of SIL, my brother got 2 tickets as a gift from his boss, so only 3 tickets were needed to be bought, but when he tried to buy them next to the gifted tickets there was no place so SIL friends bought 3 tickets in another zone, supposedly a better zone than the gifted tickets(the places where numbered). When I spoke with my brother about the seating arrangement he said that we would figure it out but that we (he and I) would be seating together, since the 2 strangers were SIL friends. That was really important for me since I’m not very social and even less in this new language, and also I travel to visit my brother so that’s the only person I care to spend time with. 

The day before the event my brother tells me that I’ll have to sit with SIL friends because SIL wants to sit with him. I proposed different solutions (changing the tickets with SIL friends for example) but the only option that would leave SIL satisfied was she sitting with my brother alone and me being seated with these two strangers I know nothing about. This turned into a hugeeeee argument between all of us because my brother wanted to do what SIL wanted to avoid fighting with her, but I stood on my ground and told him that if that was the sitting arrangement then I preferred staying at home while they went to the event (which is true). Eventually he got her to accept and I ended up being seated with my brother while SIL seated with her friends, but now she is angry at me. Was I the asshole?

It is supposed to be a 2 week trip with 11 stops. They plan to spend at most 2 days at a location (where we would camp for the night, then pack up in the morning which personally seems too rushed at each location). I wanted to begin planning for this trip a lot sooner (months prior to now) because my parents are apprehensive of a 2 week trip and I wanted a completed plan to show them early. It will also be considerably more expensive to go along with this trip.

My other friend group (6-7 people inc. me), have just started planning a shorter summer road trip (3-5 days) at just one location. The plan would be to set-up camp at the wilderness at a national park, and stay there for the entire trip and head back.

I like the idea of the second trip more because it's less expensive and more focused on hiking and adventure and will feel less rushed. The first trip doesn't emphasize these enough for me. It's just that I have been a part of their plan for a while now, and I have mentioned the idea of dropping out of the trip, which they were upset about (dissing my second friend group's plans and calling their own plans superior and more thought out).

55,1gtzvoi,AITA for getting angry?,"To give some context : I’m 29F, I went to a meetup full of foreigners and locals. I was having a great time there. Then I got invited to join a group to hang out in a bar, and then party in a night club. So with my friend (23M), let’s call him Tom, we went there. To give more context about Tom, I say that he is my friend but we have met like 4 times, but whenever I meet him I feel that he is genuinely nice, or at least he seems to be a positive person and wish the best for other people. 

But when we arrived in the bar, he wasn’t being very sociable unlike when we were at the meetup, he just didn’t talk much with everyone and was somehow following me around. He said that he wanted actually to be in a quieter place to talk, but I told him I wanted to stay because the place and people were fun. So he said he would stay.

The guy who invited me to join the group, let’s call him Lucas, is very sociable, he is like this kind of social butterfly that connects people. At some point he began to say that Tom is weird because he is following me around. The thing is that Lucas has been repeatedly saying « don’t worry, there is nobody weird in my group, we only hang out with nice and cool people », categorizing people if they are nice or weird. So now I was getting annoyed, and told him that « Tom is my friend, so he may be weird but I believe that he is a nice guy. He has never said anything out of place or negative, maybe tonight he doesn’t feel sociable anymore ». But Lucas kept repeating 4 times or more that Tom is weird because he follows me around. When Tom left, another guy of the group said « whooo you’re free now, that weird guy left ! » saying that now I was free of Tom. I felt puzzled as I never felt embarrassed by Tom nor felt followed by Tom. Isn’t it weirder to keep trashtalking him behind his back?

So at some point I got mad at Lucas and said « can’t we just stop talking about Tom? It’s been like 4 times that we keep talking about him, and you just continue to say he’s weird, I get your point but he is my friend, you don’t know him!! I may be naive but I’ll continue to stand on my ground, I believe he is nice and as he is my friend, I would be happy if we would stop trashtalking him!! » 

Like, these people were caring for me I guess but I didn’t ask for it, nor did I ever show that I was feeling worried or bad… So Lucas ended up saying that he was sorry after and didn’t mean to make me angry, but kept saying that Tom is weird...

She was known for being rude, but I thought she might be cool and befriended her. We’ve always been in a trio with S (19F), but I noticed R treated me worse than she treated S. She often made side comments that hurt my feelings, and whenever I brought it up, she dismissed me, saying, “That’s just how I am.” I’d apologize even when I wasn’t wrong, but she rarely apologized back, and if she did, it was brief and insincere.

On a trip to Puerto Rico, we were new to drinking, and I broke a promise to stay sober one night. I admit I messed up, but we all broke the rule later. Since then, R has said she doesn’t trust me, which I’ve worked on.

Recently, S and I drove 7 hours to visit R at college and go out to the bars. R made ""rules"" targeting me: no leaving with guys and no drinking too much. I messed up again, went to a pizza place with a guy, and lost her friend’s fake ID. I paid her back and apologized, but she was still mad.

The next day, we talked, and I apologized again. She said she didn’t trust me. I decided not to go out that night but changed my mind, telling her I wouldn’t drink to prove she could trust me. She agreed, and we got ready.

Once we got to her friend's dorm, the atmosphere felt tense. About 30 minutes later, R pulled me aside and told me I couldn’t go out because she didn’t trust me and thought her friends were uncomfortable around me. I was upset and asked for the dorm key to cool off alone, but she refused, saying she didn’t trust me with it. This offended me, and we argued. She stormed off, and I left to go to the frats by myself.

I got drunk and ended up crashing at a friend of a friend’s place. R and S only contacted me at 2 AM to check if I was okay. The next morning, still drunk, I snapped and sent R a harsh message. I insulted her looks, mentioned how she struggles with guys compared to me, and called her an asshole. I knew I wanted to end the friendship and felt she had treated me terribly the entire time while I let it slide.

R read the message to S, who got upset. On our drive home, I explained to S why I was done with R, but S took her side, saying she didn’t believe me and wasn’t sure we could stay friends. She called R, who told her to kick me out of the hotel room, but we decided to stick to our original plan.

I feel like R is manipulative and has turned S against me. I know I’ve made mistakes, but so has R. I’m not malicious—I just hit a breaking point. I don’t think it’s fair for R to act like she’s always in the right after how she’s treated me. I still want to be friends with S, but am I the asshole?

I do also want to say, R has been a sloppy drunk too and has made similar mistakes when in college from what she’s told the friend group - i feel like the biggest reason i should’ve matured and listened was because i was a guest and should’ve respected her boundaries but, she only holds me to these standards and no one else at her college (not even herself) even if her other friends have done the same

EDIT: I think something that shows how she is as a person, is her making arbitrary rules about my safety while also not checking up on me the entire night i was gone anyways and also aggressively shoving me to the right bathroom out of anger of me not listening to the rules to the point of my finger getting swollen from impact (while i was drunk).

60,1gty8jo,AITA for cancelling someone’s return pickups?,"My husband (35M) works for a popular clothing company that has a shopping app. He gets employee discounts on purchases via to app. Now he has given his login credentials to a few of his close friends to take advantage of his employee discounts which is of no issue to me. However, these friends have gone ahead and shared the login credentials with their own friends and families who use the app constantly and have on many occasions used up the discounts (there is a limit on the amount of discounts you can utilise per quarter or so). 
Now comes the issue - some random person whom I do not know has gone ahead and placed orders for himself but has chosen my address and contact by mistake (it was listed as one of the addresses on the app but I have now deleted it). This said person did not contact either me or my husband to apologise for the mistake and neither have they cancelled the orders in time before they were packed. This app is a real pain because all orders are shipped separately and you receive a security password via SMS that you have to give to the delivery agent even if you are returning the package. 
A little background about my situation - I work from home and have a baby who naps in the afternoons and I also have a dog… can you see where I’m going here? It’s a hassle every-time the door rings coz my dogs goes ballistic barking and the baby wakes up. The parcels for this app are almost exclusively delivered in the afternoons. In order to ensure my baby is not woken up, I have to ensure that when I know the delivery agent has entered my housing colony, i lock my dog up in a bedroom and wait by the door so he doesn’t ring the doorbell. I also often times have meetings during this time of day. I personally have stopped ordering from this site because of this issue.
I’m really miffed that the person who placed the order did not have the courtesy to give us a heads up about the mistake or to apologise. He has also gone ahead and raised requests for the packages to be picked up without requesting us! This would again incur the whole song and dance of me locking up my dog and waiting by the door during the work day which would total 6 times coz it’s 3 separate packages (2 of which have been delivered already and were due to be picked up) and one on the way. I hence went ahead and cancelled the return pickups. This will lead to the person not getting their amounts refunded. I have decided to refuse the third and final packGe for which he will get his money back.
 My husband says I’m an AH because his friend has now reached out to him saying it was his brother (from another town) who mistakenly placed the orders, and that I should not create such a fuss about the matter. Am I the AH here? 

An update - I figured why I don’t have the password - turns out neither does my husband. This has gone so way out of control that the friend (whose brother it was who ordered the packages to my address by mistake) is the one with the original login credentials! All he needed was my husband’s email address and has used his own mobile number to register. My husband doesn’t even have access to this app coz he’ll require a PIN that will be sent to his friend’s mobile number! 🙄 my husband is in the process of changing jobs and I’ve warned him against sharing such info with “friends” or anyone for that matter.

I texted Jimm after school about what exactly his intentions were.

While we had the same classes together or anything like lunch period and due to how the VP was we had to sit with our grade and class. Now this caused problems. My supposed best friend she likes to racially profile me and mock my race. It’s incredibly rude because of how she says stuff about it and she’s just a shitty person. 

So one day she just decided to start even more stuff and mock my racial identity. Saying that “ oh she’s white and this and this. Also she can’t even speak Spanish and her dad’s not in her life so how is she Mexican when she’s being raised by a white woman”fun fact I actually do speak Spanish.  

however very funny is, MY GREAT AUNT helped her parents actually get their green cards and visa. Her parents also love me. Now it would be a shame if I were to be so petty and tell her parents all what she says. Mocking me racially, talking about my awful family background, making comments about me. But no that day I had snapped at her and told her to fuck off when hers is just as bad,though not shown. AND THE WORST PART ABOUT THIS WHOLE SITUATION is one of our white friends backs her up like she’s said the wisest thing ever and that I shouldn’t be mad because she’s saying the truth. 

A) this girl is supposedly also one of my best friends and turns out they all have hated me a bit but they don’t know that I know. Then everyone at the table expects me to laugh it off like it’s a joke when they’d hate it if someone had made fun of their family and them racially. Funniest thing is it’s always the same with her, I’ve blocked her and all those people and they will remain blocked because they’re fake asf and I can’t take it. And out of that friend group there’s only one real friend and I love her, she’s the best. Just the other three are terrible and talk shit, they don’t know I know but soon they will. Planning on telling them at some point. Also to point it out my father is technically not in my life and hasn’t been since I was 5, sure he used to pop in every once in a while trying to fully be back but I always ignored it. ( there’s still a whole bunch more but I’m too tired to add it at the moment )

Alright so I'm a (22m) student in a big city that is notorious for stupidly high rent (think New York levels of stupid high rent) and I was being illegally kicked out of my home (long story) so I was searching for something new. 

Unfortunately the search was not going well, and my landlord was becoming more belligerent and abusive so I needed to get out ASAP, so I talked to my girlfriend (22F) and asked her to help me look. 

with things looking dire my girlfriend suggested that I move in with her grandparents, they have an entire 2 bedroom suite that they don't use that I could live in. obviously I took that offer and moved in. Her grandparents are retired and honestly extremely nice people and I'm very grateful that they allowed me to move in. Not only did they allow me to move in, but they charged me barely any rent (say 10% of what the place would actually be worth)

With this sweetheart deal in hand I asked my gf if maybe I could stay longer (conversations before hand implied that this was temporary) and she basically said that it was up to them, tho they really liked me cause I cooked for them a couple times lol. 

anyways, about 2 months into my stay I'm in the kitchen cooking (we share a kitchen) and grandma (lets call her G) asks:

G: ""so whats up for the week? got any assignments coming up?""

me: ""not really, though my parents are coming down for this weekend so I think I'll probably have dinner with them or something"" (my parents come down to see me and drop off home-baked goods and the like) 

G: ""oh that's terrific! where are they staying?"" 

me: ""not sure, some hotel downtown I think"" 

G: ""well, if they need a place to stay we have that bedroom in your suite they can use!"" 

me: ""wait really? they can stay here""

G: ""how long?""

me: ""just overnight, they have to be back home the next day""

G: ""oh absolutely! I'll make sure they have fresh towels for the shower"" 

me: ""wow, thank you!"" 

I remember this conversation so vividly because I have gone over it so so so many times in my head at this point. why? because 2 weeks later, well after my parents have left my girlfriend blows up on me, saying that I was taking advantage of her grandparents and not including her in decision making. 

to be clear, her grandparents are all there, sure they're not the physical apex of humanity but they've been playing tennis weekly for the last 20 years and her grandma helped me with college level math, so they are not these senile, bed ridden old people or anything like that. 

and she had over a week to voice her displeasure at the situation, when I asked her why she didn't say anything she pouted and said ""well you made the decision without me so I assumed I just wasn't considered"" and then was pissy after.

I'm just so confused because the visit was great, and they literally only used the place to sleep overnight and save on a (expensive) hotel, her grandparents loved my parents and everyone was super respectful of the space.

So now my gf has exploded and is saying that I need to get out ASAP, which I'm respecting and I'm looking at housing options.

I don't think I did anything wrong here, and frankly it hurts that she thinks I would take advantage of her grandparents like that.

65,1gtxoh1,AITA for not telling a girl that I knew her? ,"Hi. This isn’t the biggest of deals, but I’m kind of torn about it. I’m 20F, and this semester I decided to start going to college. In two of my classes, there is this girl “Iris”(20F) that has been on it for longer than I have. When we met, I didn’t recognize her, but after I saw her full name (her real name is uncommon in our language) I did. 

Iris went to the same school as me from when we were 13-16. Iris and her boyfriend were heavily bullied at the time because they were sort of considered weird. Won’t go into a lot of details but they had it pretty rough. I didn’t participate in it but I didn’t do anything about it either. Though I talked to her boyfriend a little bit sometimes and he helped me with some classes I struggled with from time to time, I kind of distanced myself from them specifically because I didn’t want to become a target. 

Anyway, I didn’t recognize her because she’s changed a lot. She’s grown up into an amazing human. When she realized that I was kind of a loner, she kind of tried to take me under her wing, which I appreciated. I’m awkward, so it was a bit odd, but it was cool to have someone to talk to in uni classes.

So I didn’t tell her I knew her, because I figured she wouldn’t like a reminder of those times and tbh I didn’t want to lose her as a friend. I am extremely average, have never talked much and don’t stand out in any way, so it wasn’t a wonder that  she didn’t remember me. 

Anyway. Iris is still with her boyfriend (20M) (the same one from school) and I guess she showed him a picture or something that had me and he remembered me. Last Thursday, she went to talk to me and asked if I remembered her and told me that she knew I went to the same school as her and I was upfront that yeah, I did. She got sad and said that that was an extremely traumatic period for her and that she would have appreciated me being honest about it straight away, since she didn’t know if she was comfortable having someone from that time in her life nowadays. I got upset, said that I wasn’t even involved in what happened to her and that I was enjoying being her friend. She apologized but said that she didn’t know if she could do it and that she needed to think. So she asked for us to not talk for a while. 

I don’t know how many people she told, but some of her friends are kind of giving me a mean look and I heard that people are calling me an asshole.

This isn’t the biggest of deals, but I’m kind of torn about it. I’m 20F, and this semester I decided to start going to college. In two of my classes, there is this girl “Iris”(20F) that has been on it for longer than I have. When we met, I didn’t recognize her, but after I saw her full name (her real name is uncommon in our language) I did. 

Iris went to the same school as me from when we were 13-16. Iris and her boyfriend were heavily bullied at the time because they were sort of considered weird. Won’t go into a lot of details but they had it pretty rough. I didn’t participate in it but I didn’t do anything about it either. Though I talked to her boyfriend a little bit sometimes and he helped me with some classes I struggled with from time to time, I kind of distanced myself from them specifically because I didn’t want to become a target. 

Anyway, I didn’t recognize her because she’s changed a lot. She’s grown up into an amazing human.

66,1gtxml1,WIBTA for telling my cousin I don’t like his girlfriend ,"
I am a female who is extremely close to my first cousins on my mom’s side. In about a month or so, we’re (me, a female cousin, her brother, brother’s girlfriend, and a mutuel friend of mine and my cousins) planing on going to a Mason Ramsey concert. I’ve just started listening to his music, so I’m not so invested in going to the concert for the music but rather the vibes. 

When I heard my cousin was asking his girlfriend if she wanted to come, my heart sank. It’s not that she’s a bad person, but she can be loud, obnoxious, and a know-it-all at times. I’m not the only one in my family who feels this way, my siblings and some of my other cousins feel the same way about her. However, because I feel this way I’ve been going over less frequently on the weekends (I used to be over there every Friday night and Saturday/was a really big part of my childhood) to the point where I haven’t seen my cousins in over a month (that’s why I want to go for the vibes) because she’s there as well and ruins the fun for me. I don’t want to make a scene during the weekends or during the concert but I don’t want to be miserable the whole night. What do I do? 

Also, we live in Illinois and the concert is in Wisconsin so we’d have the drive there, concert, and drive back together… yay.

Edit: 

It’s my first post, so thanks for the help. I saw a couple of comments saying I WBTA and I agree with you, I just also miss seeing my cousins. Like I said earlier, I don’t see them as often because she’s there ALL THE TIME, and since I don’t like her and am not in the mood to cause a scene I just don’t go. But hey, what’s one more night of not seeing my cousins? And to anyone who asks why I don’t make plans with them without his girlfriend, it’s because if I invite them to something, and he thinks his girlfriend would like it, she’s invited. This concert is an example of that, was just supposed to be the family, but when the girlfriend was invited so was the mutual friend.

I go to a private Catholic high school, and so we have a required religion credit every year. This year, it's known as CST, or, Catholic Social Teaching. Every morning at the beginning of class, we have a journal prompt on the board that we need to answer.

69,1gtx9rx,AITA for gaslighting the guy I liked into thinking that I was uninvolved in drama that I actually started?,"(18F) Two years ago in my sophomore year of HS I was interested in this guy, ‘Teddy’. I personally am very extroverted, so I often carry conversations. I was put in a group with 3 quiet guys including Teddy. I was interested only when he started to greet me first instead. Somehow I got his number while we worked on a partner project and this led to small talk and slowly to hanging out and texting. (This situationship had some red flags that I will briefly summarize: 1 - supposedly he has said racist things before (I took it with a grain of salt because it came from his ex-friends), 2 - he had nearly no personal interests, 3 - he seemed uninterested and was late to both ‘dates’ (he saw them as dates while I was unsure), 4 - he had weird excuses, he wasn't allowed to hang out in other people's houses or cars unless his mom met them (he said his family \[he is asian\] is stereotypical because they are strict)

More context: I am a gamer and I have lots of online friends. One of these friends, 'Dan' knew about Teddy because I often asked him for advice since I didn't have many in-person guy friends. (Warning: big regretful mistake incoming, I blame my naive teen self) I mentioned that Teddy plays Valorant to Dan. He asked for Teddy's number so they could play together and I thought it was cute at the time so I did it. This did not go over well because Dan lives outside the US and when Teddy received the random text, he thought it was a scam with the area code from outside the US. In response, he sent a racist meme to Dan, who is half-black, and although Teddy didn't know, the meme was blatantly racist regardless and it hit harder with context. Needless to say, I was shocked.

I am confrontational and I decided to ask about it directly which led to him questioning how I heard about it. This is where the lie unfolded...I told him I had heard from an acquaintance that he sent something racist. This led to more questions and I had to pretend that I didn’t know anything and that maybe someone was trolling him, but he kept asking. (Mistake #2 incoming) Previously, I had told Dan what Teddy's name was and he started asking me if he can say it to troll Teddy. I told him no because then Teddy would think Dan knows him personally, but Dan did it anyway.

Context: Teddy’s strict parents also monitored his online activity and saw the text messages. He came to me for info again to ease his parents. I brushed him off and told Dan to block Teddy, to calm everybody involved. This moved us past the conflict but distance grew between Teddy and I after that. Right before the start of junior year, the situationship fizzled out. I know that I dodged a bullet because of his actions but also things I had heard later. 

But I still felt guilty afterwards and considered telling him the truth about it because I didn’t mean to cause drama. AITA for never owning up to my mistakes?

EDIT: I agree with many perspectives here, I understand that I should move on and I have for the most part but I never really revealed this situation to friends before so it's important that I have some feedback. I think that what I did can constitute as gaslighting --- and maybe I downplayed it in the post but I convinced him over and over that I was uninvolved even though he was feeling highly anxious.",Everyone Sucks,2024-11-18,"AITA for gaslighting the guy I liked into thinking that I was uninvolved in drama that I actually started?

I sent my husband a text saying “hey fyi, Kepler wouldn’t go outside after dinner so if you let him out of his crate make sure he goes right out.” He does pee in the house if left unattended so we try to be really vigilant about making sure he gets out frequently. He didn’t see the text so I told him the same thing again in person when he got home with food a few minutes later and he said okay. 

My in-laws came over for dinner, we finished eating and were sitting at the table and one of the other dogs was whining. So I said to my husband, “should we let them out of their crates now that we’re done?” I meant exactly what I said and was asking his opinion, he could have said no or asked me to do it, but he interpreted it as me telling him to let them out. So he got up to go do it, and when he and 2/3 dogs came back into the dining room I said “where’s Kepler?

So I said “you should go close the crate door then” and he said “no it’s fine” and sat back down (he doesn’t remember this). He says that I could have gotten up and gone to close it if I was concerned about it, but I didn’t because I felt that it would be rude/passive aggressive in front of company to go do it myself when he said no to a thing I asked him to do (he disagrees it would have been rude), so we were just trying to keep an eye on Kepler from the table.

We finished dessert and his parents were about to leave and we wanted to give them a tour of the new house, so he and them went upstairs.

Tomorrow is my birthday but we went out to dinner tonight since tomorrow is Monday. We got home sat in the couch and he told me that he was thinking about leaving to go play music. He had not mentioned anything about it earlier but it was clearly a plan he had in his head.

Texted him “I can’t believe you just left while I was sleeping and didn’t say anything? What kind of thing is that to do? I just woke up and looked for you and you were gone? I can’t believe you would do that...” He called me to say he “didn’t know I was asleep” and he was stewing over if for 15 minutes after he came to bed so he left. He says he didn’t mean to sneak out. 

Let me also be clear, I do sometimes get irritated when he goes out at night like this for a couple of reasons. One, he goes out and will play music and have a few drinks and I do not trust he’s being safe about his choices as he has to drive there and back (no public transportation options in our area). Two, it’s a Sunday night and I have to be up in the morning and it messes up my sleep as I worry about him getting home safe. So this has been a point of contention before.

I can’t believe you would do that...” He called me to say he “didn’t know I was asleep” and he was stewing over if for 15 minutes after he came to bed so he left. He says he didn’t mean to sneak out. 

Let me also be clear, I do sometimes get irritated when he goes out at night like this for a couple of reasons. One, he goes out and will play music and have a few drinks and I do not trust he’s being safe about his choices as he has to drive there and back (no public transportation options in our area). Two, it’s a Sunday night and I have to be up in the morning and it messes up my sleep as I worry about him getting home safe. So this has been a point of contention before. 

In our day to day life he is amazing.

72,1gtwovv,AITA for trying to warn my best friend (now former best friend) before he committed why I considered a big mistake? ,"I have known this friend for a year.We had have specifically likely love lives. We spoke about it, asked advice and in general, supported each other.

Months ago, he met a new person and asked her out. She accepted, and went with him in at least four dates.  Short story, she sent him to fuck off by cutting any communication for s comment he made. He contacted her multiple times to apologize, but she never answered back. Eventually, he fell in a huge depression. I was with him all along, trying to convince him that it wasn't exactly his fault, and that her behavior (in my opinion) was pretty childish, because she didn't have the decency to even tell him ""go fuck yourself"" and instead she ghosted him.However, he went four months like that, very very badly. 

At University we knew a girl that studied the same as us, from higher semesters. Her, we discovered later, was best friends with this girl I mentioned before  and told him in his face that he was a red flag, making him cry from frustration and sorrow that same day (she didn't know). Short story, three days later he told me they have been talking, she had been flirting with him. Me, and other friends warned him about it, telling him to take things slowly.
 A week later him and this person were already a couple. I was stunned, and worried, but I kept silent because he seemed better than before, so I swallowed my comments and tried to be happy for him. A week later he did something disrespecting me in order to fulfill his girlfriend's wish at second.

Hours later I sent him a voicemail telling him about the disrespectful action, and I made a comment about that it wasn't okay to obey his girlfriend's orders immediately.
He took this very bad, saying I was disrespectful, making the mess far bigger than it was, adding a school work in team with me with many unpolite and disrespectful attitudes. I told him I didn't want to stay friends with him, that he was disrespectful, that he was settling the perfect environment for a far worse decline in his mental health than the last one (because he had been making this new girl his world, not seeing his friends anymore, spending money on her at ONE week after meeting her) he experienced with the other person and mentioning him that she wasn't exactly a good person, and that I considered that he was doing many mistakes (and that our friends agreed).He told me that I was jealous of his situation, that I wanted to drag him back to when he was bad, that I was disrespectful and envious.

75,1gtw8yi,AITA for making my lesbian daughter’s children blankets?,"Throw away account

Basically I (52F) have three daughters, Anne (30F), Carrie (26F) and Jane (20F). All fake names.

When all my girls turned 18, I made them a special blanket. I then made three swaddle blankets out of the same materials for their future children. Carrie told me not to because she didn't want kids. I found out later it was because she's a lesbian. I said okay, but made them just in case.

Earlier this year, Carrie married her lovely wife, Rory (28F). Her amazing daughter Diane (5F) is my third grandchild. I approached Rory and asked if I could give her one of the blankets I made for Carrie's kids, or if she wanted me to make one special for her out of the materials I used to make their wedding living room blanket. I always give these out on the day they're born, so for Diane I plan on giving it on her birthday and was explaining that to her. She told me to ask Diane. I did, and Carrie overheard.

I found out that she's pregnant because she was crying and yelling that I didn't respect her wishes so how can she trust me with her baby? I'm just so confused and hurt. I was trying to do something nice for all my girls, and then my sweet Diane. Instead of being happy I was cautious, Carrie is threatening to go low contact because I don't respect her and am obviously homophobic because how else would I have thought she'd get pregnant, which is very confusing. Rory is telling me it's hormones and that Carrie is emotional because of how hard it was to get pregnant (I didn't know they had been trying) and that she's afraid she's going to lose it.

AITA? I was trying to be kind. I wasn't being homophobic or trying to be disrespectful.

Edit: I don't know if it's relevant, but I still have material from the blankets for patching, so I was planning on adding to Diane's to make it big enough to use or I was going to let her have it fit her baby dolls. That's what my other two granddaughters do now that it's too small for them.

77,1gtw8rq,AITAH for not texting my friend reminding her of my birthday dinner?,"I (22F) just had my birthday on November 15. My friend group consists of five people: Friend A (24F), Friend B (24F), Friend C (22F), Friend D (26F), and me. I’ve known Friend A the longest—she was my best friend before I introduced her to the others. However, this past year, we've drifted apart, and while I’ve made efforts to reconnect (texting more, inviting her to hang out), she’s been distant, often replying dryly or ghosting me. Recently, I’ve been giving her space.

The Sunday before my birthday, I ran into Friend A at a local coffee shop. I told her I was planning a birthday dinner on Saturday and invited her, mentioning that my brothers and mom would be there and that the rest of the group was invited. She said “oh I don’t know. I’m probably busy this weekend but I’ll let you know.” I took that as disinterest because she didn’t seem enthusiastic and her tone was frankly very cold. So I didn’t follow up.

Saturday night, I had the dinner, which was really fun. Friend B, C, and D came over for drinks afterward, but Friend A never texted or showed up. About two hours into the hangout, B started acting distant—she was on her phone a lot and seemed quiet. Eventually, she snapped at me and left abruptly. Afterward, I walked out to her car to check if I had done something wrong. She told me she was upset because A had said I didn’t invite her to the party.
Confused, I texted A, asking if I had done something to upset her. She responded the next morning, saying she was ""confused why everyone was at my house"" and that she saw us on SnapMap. I asked her what she meant and why she hadn’t come if she had known we were all there. She said I never clarified that she was invited, which was news to me since I specifically told her she was invited.
I called A to explain the situation. I reminded her of our conversation at the coffee shop and how she said she was unsure if she’d come. She got defensive, saying I should have texted her again to confirm and made sure she came. She accused me of being a bad friend for not reminding her and said I was bitter. She also claimed this was why the group had been hanging out without me lately. She hung up on me after calling me a “bitch.”
I feel confused. I definitely invited her, and I didn’t think I needed to chase after her to confirm she would attend, especially since she said she would let me know. Now, I’m wondering if I should have followed up more, but I didn’t expect her to be upset by it.

80,1gtvuyn,WIBTA if I told an elderly man from my church I will not be shaking his hand?,"Hey, Internet.

If I'm TA here, I accept it. So, where I (26M) currently go to church, there's this elderly man, I'll call W (Probably in his 80s, or older). He sits in the foyer, because I think presumably, he finds it difficult to walk to the auditorium, and he has a clear view of the entrance door when he sits.

To cut to the chase, W is the kind to always call peoples' names excitedly and wants to shake hands, and he has a habit of grabbing one's hand with both of his when people do shake hands with him. And sometimes, he'll pull them in for a hug. He tends to call me ""Brother OP"" OP's Not my actual name, but I guess it's an elderly church thing among men to call ""Brother"".

He makes me uncomfortable, as I do not feel he respects my boundaries. I am not one to shake hands at all, and I usually wait for people to offer it to me, and meeting people does make me a bit uncomfortable, but no one else really pulls me in for a hug (except for him) unless I'm really good friends with the person. It just takes a long while for me to get used to a person.

In W's case, I've tried to just give fist bumps, but he insists I shake his hand. I've had to fake sickness and coughing just to avoid it, which he accepts (with visible disappointment). If I don't fake sickness he'll keep on insisting I shake his hand to the point of annoyance.

I did talk to my younger brother about it (since he also puts up with him and is also a bit uncomfortable with hugging or people like W), and he told me that I should just let it go because W is old, and he's probably lonely, etc. I always just thought that since I'm my own person, I have my own autonomy and it's my choice to hug or shake hands, etc. And no one has a right to me doing that, regardless of age.

I'm really close to saying, ""Well if you don't want a fist bump for me, then bye. Have a good day"". Then leaving. Or simply leaving and ignoring him. Or try to see if I can more firmly state, ""Fist Bump Only"" towards him.

Hello Internet. Thanks for commenting. I see that everyone has mixed ratings for me, both great and not great, and I accept everyone's ratings.   
Some other questions came up:  
1. What do I do with the ""Peace be with you"" handshake? - The Church I am talking about actually does not do that specific handshaking time. There are handshakes during before/after service times, but in that case, I often just fist my hand when others offer a handshake, and usually everyone else just fist-bumps me back, without thinking much of it.   
2. Why do I not want to shake hands, germaphobia?  - I am kind of a germophobe, yes. I am also a sweat-phobe both ways, meaning I am afraid of shaking hands and the other person's hand being sweaty, and I'm also afraid of shaking hands and my own being sweaty. I also have Halitophobia, which is why when I talk to people I tend to keep a distance, and don't really let anyone whisper in my ear. One of my biggest pet peeves is when I'm chilling with people, and they suddenly exhale through their mouth within close proximity of me. Luckily, I just have to hold my breath for three seconds, and then things dissipate. This presents the question, ""Do I exhale through my mouth around people?"" The answer, no. I exhale through my nose. Another thing that I can't exactly take is that people also tend to squeeze hands when they shake hands, and my hands can't really take much of it.  
3. Have I tried telling him I'm uncomfortable with physical contact? Well Yes. When it started a few months back, I tried telling him, I did fist-bumps, and then he kept repeating ""Oh, come on. Shake my hand!"" I repeated what I said, and he also kept repeating, but adding in, ""I don't bite"". I started resorting to faking sickness because I knew that he wouldn't listen to me if I told him I just did fist bumps. This wasn't just a problem that sprung up overnight, but something that happened over the course of a few months, and now, it's just gotten unbearable.   
4. Have I shaken hands before? - Well, in a few instances, yes. But everyone around me knows to just give fist bumps at this point.  
5. So much for caring - Let me just say this, we're all human, and all of us has a Rubbish Limit. I do go to church, yes, but I do not fit the stereotype that most people have about church goers. If W wanted to talk with me about his younger years, then I'd be all ears. I have had close friendships with people around his age. Most of them, I've had to mention, ""I don't like talking about myself if that's okay Tell me something about your first job"" or something else that's nostalgic. ",Not the A-hole,2024-11-18,"WIBTA if I told an elderly man from my church I will not be shaking his hand? Hey, Internet.

If I'm TA here, I accept it. So, where I (26M) currently go to church, there's this elderly man, I'll call W (Probably in his 80s, or older). He sits in the foyer, because I think presumably, he finds it difficult to walk to the auditorium, and he has a clear view of the entrance door when he sits.

To cut to the chase, W is the kind to always call peoples' names excitedly and wants to shake hands, and he has a habit of grabbing one's hand with both of his when people do shake hands with him. And sometimes, he'll pull them in for a hug. He tends to call me ""Brother OP"" OP's Not my actual name, but I guess it's an elderly church thing among men to call ""Brother"".

He makes me uncomfortable, as I do not feel he respects my boundaries. I am not one to shake hands at all, and I usually wait for people to offer it to me, and meeting people does make me a bit uncomfortable, but no one else really pulls me in for a hug (except for him) unless I'm really good friends with the person. It just takes a long while for me to get used to a person.

In W's case, I've tried to just give fist bumps, but he insists I shake his hand. I've had to fake sickness and coughing just to avoid it, which he accepts (with visible disappointment). If I don't fake sickness he'll keep on insisting I shake his hand to the point of annoyance.

81,1gtvg7l,WIBTA if I were to exclude my father from significant wedding activities,"I (29F) am engaged to be married to my fiancé (30M). Our families are from a traditionally conservative background, but we live in the US. My father is a gambling addict and has not been a significant part of my life for many years. My mom, although still legally married to my father, pretty much singlehandedly raised my brother (26M) and I alone. We both graduated from top universities, debt-free, and now work highly successful jobs in tech/biotech.

While I understand that my father is struggling with his mental health and I have received therapy/counseling to grieve the father I once knew and continue to work on forgiving him for his absence in my life, I have decided that he would not play the traditional role a father would at a daughter's wedding. For instance, he will not be walking me down the aisle, and I will not be participating in a father-daughter dance. Instead, I have asked my younger brother to walk me down the aisle (to which he has enthusiastically agreed), and fiancé and I will just do a first dance. I will still invite my father to my wedding, and I won't prevent him from being part of family photos or sitting at the family table. My fiancé is fully on board with this decision and has always supported the boundaries I have set with my father.

The issue is with my mom and aunt (father's sister). Both women insist that it wouldn't be right for my brother to walk me down the aisle because it would go against ""tradition"" and it would make my in-laws and other guests uncomfortable and question why my father wasn't walking me. There is a lot of ""shame"" in our culture associated with mental illness, and older generations generally don't acknowledge or share these things with anyone outside of family. I feel strongly about this, but I saw how much distress it gave my mom, and I'm starting to wonder since it's just a few seconds of walking, should I give in?

82,1gtv6yo,AITA for not apologizing because I feel like I didn't do anything wrong?,"Trying to make this as short as possible because a lot has happened.

My (32F) SIL (30F, spouse's sister) is getting married early next year and had a plans for a lot of events before that, like a bridal shower for just her, a wedding shower for her and her fiancé, a bachelorette party, and a trip to look at wedding dresses. A lot of these dates and times were TBA or tentative. I'll mention that I am not part of the bridal party, which I don't care about since I'm busy anyway, but it's important to mention. I did go on the wedding dress trip and ended up picking the dress she ultimately bought (and was super happy about).

I had let her know two months in advance that I wouldn't be able to make one of the pre-wedding events (which had a date confirmed but not a time) because it fell at the exact same time as another obligation. I honestly thought that I would be able to do both events in the same day, but as soon as the pre-wedding event time was announced, I immediately let her know. Again, I was not part of any event planning for this or part of the bridal party. She did not let me know this was an issue until two months later, but I had already known she was upset because she told other people who later told me that she wants me to apologize because I didn't say act sorry about missing. She sent me a text message where she tried to guilt trip me and act as if I have not been active anything wedding-related. I ultimately didn't answer because 1) she is the type of person that you can't reason with 2) I had nothing nice to say and 3) anything I said was just going to be twisted and used against me.

Since then, she has continued to send me messages telling me how terrible I am (not this nicely worded) and essentially just trying to continually guilt trip me. Again, I have not answered any of these messages because of the above reasons. I have since been uninvited to the wedding. 

While I still don't plan to reply, AITA for not apologizing, especially since it's causing stress in my spouse's family?

EDIT: Because there have been several questions, I’ll try to answer them. I tried not to include too much info just because I have friends and family on Reddit. 

The obligation was an opportunity that I had waited almost 10 years for, which is longer than I’ve known my spouse or my SIL, but never thought I’d have the chance to do. The obligation required six different dates at a specific time that I needed to be able to attend, including the date and time of the pre-wedding event. This obligation also required around a month of work prior to the above dates. 

The requested apology is for missing the pre-wedding event and not sounding sorry about it. That’s it. Nothing else. SIL and spouse were raised in a family where “you drop everything” for family events, even if you have something else important but not family related going on. 

Spouse is not attending the wedding in solidarity with me.

I included the bit about me going to the wedding dress shopping day because I’ve been accused of not being supportive. There have been other things I’ve done (offered to help plan [was never taken up on offer], gave advice on the wedding website, giving wedding checklists to help with planning, etc.), but this was the biggest example, especially since I drove over an hour to do this with SIL because it was important to her. 

EDIT 2: There was another comment that asked why I didn’t just reply. I did say above why I haven’t, but I’ll add more context for the sake of such. 

Spouse has reached out to SIL at the request of MIL. Even though spouse has done nothing wrong and should not have been included anyway, SIL has been increasingly aggressive towards spouse and has been insulting towards spouse, myself, and our home (where she has stayed multiple times). Each time, spouse has tried to deescalate the situation, but SIL continues to ramp up her texts, including texting out of the blue to guilt trip spouse.

87,1gtug56,AITA for not letting my “little sister” borrow my nintendo switch? ,"SOME CLARIFICATIONS

My brother and I already have a lawyer, we are already looking into changing the deeds of the house to our name. Of course I care about the money she took but in the bank my dad left 75% to me and 25% to her. When we talked, my stepmother returned what she owned after the bank gave us our parts. The thing is that because of her blocking the bank account I was left without money for 4 months while she had enough money to go to the doctor and pay her things. My dad was my sole provider, my mom can’t work due to her age so the first 4 months were hard for us. 

Our lawyer told us that, since we already have the will and have accepted being heirs to my dad’s estates, she cannot have any claim to either of the properties. 

The problem with the switch is just a minor thing but I tend to overthink a lot over these things because, in the span of 5 months, I didn’t just loose my father but I also lost the family he built and nurtured. 

To be clear, everything legal is either solved or on the way of being solved. My brother and I are covered and are supported by two wonderful lawyers. 

Hi, so I (23F) recently lost my dad (58M) a few months ago due to a heart attack. My parents got divorced a very long time ago and in 2017 my dad moved in with his girlfriend (42F), so every other weekend I would spend time with them and my stepmothers daughter (15F). Just to be clear I am using the age they have right now in 2024. So in June my dad passed away and I started having panic attacks because he was my sole economic provider, I am still studying and I do work but don’t make enough to support me and my mom. 

In the midst of the drama my brother and my aunts started helping me with finding my dad’s testament and getting his affairs in order. Long story short, my stepmother took out a large sum of money from my dad’s account three days after he died, she changed the passwords and everything. Here’s the thing, I don’t have a problem with her taking out the money but I’m upset because she never told me, I gave her chances to tell me and what she did made the process with the bank more complicated and she also did some other stuff that make me uncomfortable to talk but she has basically gone and told all of my dads friends that me and my brother are trying to kick her out of her house because it’s in my dads name and he left it to me and my brother. 

Now to the deal with my “sister”. So, for the 9 years my dad and his gf were together her daughter and I got along very well but then she became a teenager and she started ordering me to do things. Our last fight was because she wanted me to take her dog out for a walk and that day I didn’t feel well and said no and she got angry, I ended up apologising. 
Since my dad died I think I texted her once to ask her if she was ok and she was nice and we talked and it was fine, then I texted her a second time a while after for a code I needed and she was rude to me and I haven’t texted her back cause i’ve been busy and i’m dealing with a lot emotionally.

A few weeks ago she texted me saying she wanted to borrow the nintendo switch she had gifted me and I told her I didn’t have it. First because she didn’t even say hello and second day because i was using it, I lied and I felt horrible but I also didn’t want to say no because I was actually thinking of giving it to her. A couple of days later she texted me and asked again if she could have the nintendo, as I was about to respond she adds “because I gave it to you so you would leave it here in my house” and that’s when I made my mind up. 

Listen, I understand her mom’s actions should not affect her and I also understand she is a teenager but, honestly, she felt so entitled to ask me for a game she GIFTED me and, in any logical persons mind, I wouldn’t of have left the game at my dads house cause i don’t live there. I feel like i’m being petty but the game has also stayed at my house for the last year and I also understand that there is no harm in lending it to her but I feel like she isn’t going to return it and had she asked for it in a nicer way I wouldn’t have a problem.

So I agreed to recommend his work to some of my contacts, as soon as he prepares a portfolio that’s more fitting to the market’s demands.

He sent me some stuff he’s working on and I tried to give him some honest feedback. One of the things I said is that his work looks a bit derivative of Quentin Blake’s style (that’s the illustrator who worked in most of Roald Dahl’s book) and that he should keep practicing to showcase a more unique personality. 

Despite telling my bf that this is part of the process - even mentioning that Tim Burton’s early illustrations were declined by publishers who found it too derivative of Dr Seuss -, he took the feedback very personally and I could tell he was a bit hurt.

I told him he must get used to it if he wants to build a career in this business, and if he likes his work as it is he can try to get his foot in the door through other means and maybe receive other opinions, but I will not be using my own network to recommend a professional that I don’t think is quite there.

His entire family (I don't claim them as family) are all caught up in a giant web of manipulation and lies. When I was young he tried to convince me that my biological mom was bad. That she had cheated on him and that's why they divorced. That wasn't true, although I was young and he had convinced me adults only spoke truth so l believed him and in return resented my mom for a little.

He always gaslit me and acted as if my mom put that in my head. All I've ever mentioned was what I've seen, heard, and felt him do. Not what other people have told me he's done. I sent him a text.

90,1gtu29y,WIBTA if I call my sister out for being financially irresponsible ,"I 21 (F) have an older sister, 34 (F) who is a single parent to my nephew. My sister has a well paying job but she is horrible with her finances she’s always eating out, going to expensive concerts, going out to dance, and buying herself new stuff when she goes out. 9 years ago my sister bought a house and our mother gave her the money she needed for the downpayment with the caveat our mom would live with her. Our mother pays a good chunk of bills (house insurance, phone, gas, car insurance, groceries, pet food and supplies) but she does not pay rent. The mortgage is pretty reasonable for what my sister earns. She also gets so much help with my nephew (6 yrs old) as our mom washes their clothes, cleans and cooks for them, and buys groceries regularly for there to be food for my nephew to eat. My sister treats our mom like shit even though she has had help with everything and uses our mom as a free babysitter. Our mom does it out of love for my nephew but my sister does not appreciate it. 

…. 

3 weeks ago my sister told our mom that the house is in foreclosure and that she hasn’t paid the mortgage for months and that she is very in debt so she has to forfeit the house. She told our mom they have until February to move out and that she doesn’t know where my mom will go but her and my nephew will move to a 1 bedroom apartment. This makes me so angry with her of all the expenses, your house should be the 1st thing that gets paid especially when you are making more than enough money to cover it but she doesn’t want to give up or cut back on her lifestyle and budget it out.  She very recently spent at least 700+ for her to go to a concert for next year. What makes me even more upset is that my nephew has to suffer the consequences of the irresponsible choices my sister continues to make. I want to sit my sister down and ask her what is she doing, she isn’t 21 anymore she doesn’t come first anymore she need to make responsible choices for my nephew to be well taken care of. My sister has a very short temper and she HATES being wrong and called out but I feel that she needs a serious reality check, she can’t have everything she wants when there are necessities that she as a mother has to take care of. WIBTA? 

On another note my sister was in a long term relationship with a MUCH older man, and she desperately wanted to get married and buy a house with him. She ended up breaking up with him because, so she says, he would still hang around his ex wife and her family. But in my opinion it’s because the man was in his 60s, has grown kids and did not want to get married to her. I hate to think that she stopped paying it because she gave herself the illusion they’d eventually get married and she’d be taken care of.

91,1gttnba,AITA for refusing to help my father?,"
To preface, I (18M) and my brother (19M) are very well off. My parents owe $25,000 to my brother within the span of just one year. The moment my brother turned 18, my father packed up all of his stuff and threw a fit because he felt like he deserved a lot of his money. My brother, scared, gave my father $3000 to keep the peace. Since then, he is now owed roughly $25,000.

If i’m being honest, I don’t have any clue where the money went. We’ve had people that paid our rent for us almost our entire lives, so it’s not rent. I presume a lot of it went to food, though that isn’t important.

My brother was promised to be paid back, though it was never specified when exactly. So far, he hasn’t been. 

I told my parents that I would not allow them to do the same for me. That I wanted to help out because I felt kind, not scared. 

Recently, my father suffered an injury, but has healed, and decided to go back to work for the first time in YEARS. He wanted a way to pay back my brother. I thought this was amazing. Although I was skeptical, I bought my father everything he needed to go back to work. Expensive work boots, food, bus fares. I didn’t spoil him, but I bought exactly what he needed and didn’t tell him to pay me back for it.

The other day, my brother came home from a trip out with our father, afraid. Word for word, my brother told me, “We are fucked.”

My father cornered my brother essentially out in public and lectured him. He said that we are ‘cheap kids’ and that we never ‘help him out’. He said that we should never ask him for money ever in our lives because we are heartless. He said we should be lucky that he doesn’t kick us out because he ‘struggles so hard to pay the rent and his tickets’. Again, he doesn’t pay rent. Next month he will, but he isn’t now. He told my brother that if he ever told me or my mother, that he would be fucked.

A few years ago, my father got ticketed for a bunch of things. I forget what exactly, but it was along the lines of driving while high, without a license, without insurance, without a correct license plate, stuff like that. It came out as a $2,000 fine.

It started off as passing comments about how he needed this and that, then he started stealing my money. Not much, but he’d pocket my change here and there, and just yesterday he stole $5 claiming it was bus money.

And I feel like rightfully so, i’m allowed to get angry at that. He can call me cheap as much as he wants, but he’s throwing the same words at my brother, who has been more than generous.

I don’t feel like it’s my job to pay off my father’s mistakes, but he hates me now because of it. I don’t plan on doing anything to help him unless he’s seriously struggling. I plan to move out soon, I don’t plan on paying his rent. Am I wrong for just sitting back and watching this unfold?

I showed my future mother in law what color and style of dress I wanted her and my mother to wear a darker pink and the grandmothers as well. I told her she could pick her own style dress but that’s the color I would like for it to be. She was ok with it but then starts scrolling on line and shows me to the dress she wants which fits the pink I’m ok with it and I said sure no problem she keeps looking and finds an other dress which happens to be the pink and exact dress that I picked out for the bridesmaid. I politely tell her that’s the dress I picked out for the bridesmaids please pick something else.

Now I’m trying to scrambled since the wedding is 6 months away to find a new dress for the bridesmaids and color since she went and ordered the dress. I spoke to my mom and my bridesmaids, and tried to go back to the drawing board but just thinking about it makes me so upset. He spoke to his mom about it and she called me but the way she addressed it was like oh I already ordered it is there any way I can keep it since I don’t have much money to order an other dress kinda making me feel bad and guilty over it. But each time I look for an other dress it’s like I had my mind set up on that one for them and now I have to figure it out. I texted my fiancé today as he’s at work to vent to him how I’m struggling to find a new dress and how it’s upsetting that I have to even do this and he tells me why am I being so difficult and tells me it’s just a dress and is annoyed by me bringing it up and says in a annoyed tone I’ll tell her to not wear it then and buy her an other dress since your complaining about it, but I’m like I showed you what everybody was going to wear so we can match accordingly why would you even agree to it knowing that’s the dress I picked for them.

96,1gtsjgi,AITA for telling my sister’s roommate off without asking her?,"So, I (16F) have an older sister (18F) who is in college. She is rooming with her best friend from high school, who we’ll call Amanda. Amanda joined a sorority and loves to drink and party. My sister, on the other hand, is way more focused on her studies and her boyfriend. She doesn’t go out near as much as Amanda. Now, I don’t give a flying guck what Amanda does. Do I think she’s being stupid? Sure. Is she failing all her classes? Yes. It’s not my place to tell her what to do at college and I know that. So, let’s get into why I am not very fond of her at the moment:
- She and all her sorority friends are eating all my sister’s food. My family pays for my sister’s food, seeing as she is unable to get a job due to her extremely difficult major and lack of transportation. We are not in poverty, but we do not have a lot of money, which is why my sister does not have a car (yes, she did save for one as she worked all throughout high school, but unexpected emergencies pop up and we just haven’t been able to make it work yet). My mom, who has a job as a lunch lady and does deliveries for grocery stores and whatnot, sends my sister just enough money to get herself enough food and what she needs to make it through the week. Amanda and all her sorority friends, whom she brings back to their shared dorm without my sister permission, are devouring my sister’s food. We do not have the money to feed a whole sorority. I would feel some pity for them and their hunger, however, we live in a fairly wealthy area and Amanda and her friends are sent 400-500 dollars a week from their families. They are more than capable of getting their own food and have plenty of money to spare. My sister does not.
- Amanda keeps trying to bring guys back to their shared dorm, again, without my sister’s permission. Luckily, my sister has been able to keep this from succeeding as of now. Let me clarify that the dorm is one room that they share with a community bathroom. My sister, who needs time to study and relax, obviously does not want Amanda and some random guy-of-the-week fucking in the bed next to hers while she is trying to sleep.
- Amanda’s friends have barfed and pissed all over my sister’s dorm. First, the other night, Amanda’s drunk-as-shit friend barfed all i’ve their council and floor. Now, she was very apologetic, helped clean it up, and payed for all the damages, as she should. However, just last night, Amanda’s other friend, who we will call Nina, pissed all over my sister’s dorm. Some background on Nina: When they first got to college (they are freshman) Nina crashed in their couch for about a month because she “didn’t like her roommate,” despite the fact that there was nothing wrong with her roommate. Nina just had a problem with her. Although my sister was not very pleased about sharing such a small, cramped space with two other girls, she graciously let Nina stay until she got another dorm. So- back to last night- Nina is incredibly drunk. There had been a football game, so parties hadn’t started until around 1 in the morning. My sister, ever the old lady, stayed out for about an hour and a half and headed back to the dorm at 2:30, falling asleep at 4. Around 20 minutes after she falls asleep, Nina burst in the dorm and knocks over a whole table of food (my sister’s food). Then, because she is wasted, she decides that the fridge must be a toilet, and begins to pee everywhere. All. Over. The. Place. My sister, woken up by the clattering, sees this and attempts to push Nina out of the room towards the bathroom. Nina, however, does not want to listen, and almost starts a physical altercation with my sister. This is unacceptable. Finally, Nina is gone (the details of how I am unsure of) and the dorm is trashed. My sister and Amanda have to throw out their rug, their coffee pot, their water filter, and several other things. Nina, the day after, apologizes for her behavior to several people. Except for my sister. She does not say one word to my sister except for trying to show up later in the day to grab something she left, and my sister promptly shut the door in her face.
So- onto the real story now. I decided to message Amanda and give her a piece of my mind, respectfully as possible. I love my sister, but she is horrible at standing up for herself. I did not do this solely on impulse. I asked a few of my friends if it would be a bad idea, and they said no. Here is what I said to Amanda:
“hi amanda!!! you will not tell (my sister’s name) about this message because she doesn’t like me telling people off for her, but lord knows she’s not gonna do it. get. your shit. together. we are too damn poor for every one of your friends to eat my sisters food. we are too damn poor to replace all the shit they break and piss on. and that’s not your fault obviously!! you did not tell people to barf on yalls stuff or pee on it but good LORD. it is not the whole colleges dorm. it is yours and (my sister’s name)’s. do not try to bring guys back. do not try to bring drunk sorority girls back. if you want someone there, YOU ASK MY SISTER FIRST. it is so incredibly disrespectful of you to treat her like this when you are her best friend. i’m so disappointed in you. college, nevertheless pre-med shit, is hard enough for her and she doesn’t not need you or anyone else making it harder. if you want to party and have fun instead of focusing on college, that is your choice. i’m not gonna judge. but when all this shit is effecting my sister? it’s not okay. hope this gives you something to think about. (again, i’m not saying this is all your fault, but you are a part of it.)” To which she responds, “it is not any of ur business to talk to me in that way, me and (my sister’s name) will work r stuff out on r own, dont ever talk to me like that again” And so I respond, “(my sister’s name) is my sister. i will say whatever i feel is necessary to protect her well-being. if i got any of the details wrong, then yeah, that’s my fault and i apologize. but when something is effecting my family? it’s my business. and i do not apologize for that.”

97,1gtshtc,AITA for taking pictures with my guy friend at a school dance?,"So, I (F13) and my best friend (F14) are friends with this guy who’s also our good friend. He’s kind of the “new kid” at school since it’s his first year here. We’ve been friends with him way before he started dating his girlfriend.

Recently, we had a middle school dance, and all of us were there — me, my best friend, the guy, and his girlfriend (they didn’t come together though). Like most dances, there was a photo booth area. Me, my best friend, him, and a couple of other friends went to take pictures together. We took a few photos, nothing weird — just normal group pictures, and none of us were like hugging or being touchy. (In most of the pics we were doing pose 28 lol.)

Here’s where it gets messy. One of the popular girls (his girlfriend is also popular) came up to us, but she only spoke to my best friend for some reason. She said something along the lines of, “Why are you taking pictures with [his name], knowing he has a girlfriend?”

Now, I get that some people might feel jealous, but I don’t understand this situation at all. First off, it wasn’t even his girlfriend who said it, but maybe she told this girl to come talk to us?

98,1gtsd9i,AITA for telling off my mother for eating all my snacks? ,"I live at home, I rent a room (900 USD a month) and I help with groceries. I also pay the phone and internet bill.

I buy stuff to enjoy throughout the week and I can't even do that because she doesn't work and, in her words, ""there's nothing else to eat!"" so she just digs into my stash.

I've politely asked her MULTIPLE TIMES to stop eating up everything so quickly and her response is always to smugly tell me that she's ""showing me what it was like ;) (because I supposedly as a child ate up everything?)"".  Normally I roll my eyes and keep it moving, they're just snacks. It really sucks when I go to eat something and it isn't there because she's eaten it, but it's just food.

However today, I got very very angry as she basically inhaled a particularly expensive snack (honey combs from a local bee farm)  I'm only able to get once a month. I could snack on this thing for week, slowly, but she gobbled it all down in a day. I yelled. She yelled back. I've cooled off now and I'm wondering if I was in the wrong.

I'm especially angry about it though because growing up I was constantly, constantly yelled at and demeaned for eating the snacks she bought. But when she does it to me as an adult, it's okay.

Normally I roll my eyes and keep it moving, they're just snacks. It really sucks when I go to eat something and it isn't there because she's eaten it, but it's just food.

However today, I got very very angry as she basically inhaled a particularly expensive snack (honey combs from a local bee farm)  I'm only able to get once a month. I could snack on this thing for week, slowly, but she gobbled it all down in a day. I yelled. She yelled back. I've cooled off now and I'm wondering if I was in the wrong.

I'm especially angry about it though because growing up I was constantly, constantly yelled at and demeaned for eating the snacks she bought. But when she does it to me as an adult, it's okay.

  
**EDIT:** I can't name the snack, as it would effectively dox me. But it's made from specialty honey and is basically my super special treat :/ ",0.0,0.034208786,0,1
99,1gts2tw,AITA for going on my phone at the cinema,"I recently went to the cinema to watch the new Ridley Scott movie Gladiator 2, by myself. During the film I pulled out my phone a to text my mum about where to meet her afterwards. 

While I was texting her I felt something on my shoulder. As I turned I realised it was a women sitting 2 seats across from me, who had thrown her empty coffee cup at me. Before I had any time to process what had happened, she told me to get off my phone. I apologised and turned my phone off.

I had my phone on the lowest brightness possible and pulled my phone close to my chest to one side, so to limit the amount of light from my phone. I don’t have the best attention span and struggle to pay attention to long movies. With it being over 2 hours long, I checked my phone a couple of times to check the time and some of my messages.

I understand that some people find this annoying and as such I try to be as mindful as possible, however I don’t think the reaction was necessary at all. She could’ve went over to me and asked me, instead of chucking a coffee cup at me.
