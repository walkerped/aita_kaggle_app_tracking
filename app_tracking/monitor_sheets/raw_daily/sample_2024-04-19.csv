0,1c7obdr,AITA for refusing to uproot my life and move back in with my Parents?,"So I 31M moved out of my parents home when I was 19yr. I have lived on my own and with different roommates for the past 12-ish years. My current problem is that my Parents want me to move back home, they need my ""help"" both financially ""to which I've already been sending them money whenever I can"" and to help take care of them. They had me late in the game, they are both in their early 70's. I have four older siblings, but because I'm the only one of us five that don't have kids. They expect me to drop my life and move two states away so that I can move back in with them. On my own dime too.

I told them no, that I wouldn't do it. I don't have the best relationship with my mother. While my father is a basically a teddy bear, my mother spent most of my life telling me how much I ruined her plans. How I wasn't supposed to happen. Took a fit every time she had to spend money on me while at the same time never shying away from dropping $20's and $50's in the communion basket during church. Screaming at me for being to small to fit in my older brothers hand me downs when he was always tall for his age, while I've always been short. 

I told them no. My father seems to understand, but my mother's gone on a rampage. I've been getting calls from people in my old neighborhood that I haven't seen in years talking down to me about my decision. My siblings have also been badgering me about it.  

So Reddit, AITA for not wanting to uproot my life and move two states away on my own dime, just to move back in with my parents? ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,-0.013529546,0,1
1,1c7o7jn,AITA for telling my best friend’s parents about their DUI,"This friend would often drink to the point of passing out in the bathroom wherever we were. I would drive her home &  cover her tab to get us out of the embarrassment caused by bartenders finding her in the bathroom (since I couldn’t go & get her from the woman’s room). This caused me to pull away & we hung out less - eventually not at all. She got a DUI (she didn’t tell their parents about) & then during the time we stopped talking, she went into detox. They knew know about that though.

We reconnected but she still drinks. A month ago, she lost her apt key & went to the front desk - they weren’t helpful. She called me & I could tell she had been drinking. The cops were came. She got arrested for disorderly intoxication. Without money to bail her out, I called her parents. She lost her job because she no call no showed & she’s likely not going to be offered a renewal at her apt. 

She drinks & takes Ativan to try and stop. I told her how dangerous that combo is & she said via text: I am fully aware of the dangers and I in fact welcome them. I needed to tell her parents all of the truth. They didn’t know how long her issue had been going on. All they knew about was detox and her recent arrest. Although I’m sure they had suspicions I figured with this knowledge, they would be inclined to look at an involuntary assessment. 


I decided to tell them in the AM but she text me saying she decided to stop. I was relieved & figured I would let things play. 2 days later, she wanted to go to a park by & asked to park at my place to avoid fees. I dropped her off at the park & when I picked her up, she was so drunk she was speaking gibberish. She was in a rush to get home. She’d just started her own therapy practice & had clients to see. I told her, you aren’t good to drive/work. I stalled & told her, if you want to drive, blow into the breathalyzer I brought & if you’re good, good - if not, let’s just get you an Uber. She agreed. .16. She claimed it was broken but agreed to Uber if we could just get her apt keys from her glove box. She hops in & starts blowing her horn because I blocked her in. I called her mom & her mom called her. She told her mom she’d hang with me until she was okay but she got off the phone & started causing a scene. She was out of her car so I tried to park & talk to her but she hopped in & took off. 

I told her parents everything, knowing it would end our friendship. I was hopeful they’d try to get her help. She texted me telling me you’re horrible & did you tell them about your own drinking problems - there was no benefit of them knowing about her DUI etc. she said I hurt them & “fucked up two good people’s lives tonight” because I told them something from 2 years ago.

Everything about the situation sucks. The drunk driving, the mixing booze and pills, but also practicing as a therapist while often times intoxicated. I just want her to get help. So am I the asshole for telling her parents about the extent of her situation?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,0.033764128,0,1
2,1c7nt5e,AITA for attempting to refuse to leave my uncle's house when he was dying?,"A few years ago, my (bio) uncle was dying of dementia and I was slated to stay a few days with my aunt at their old house on what turned out to be the second to last week of his life.  It was 2021 and I was 21 at the time.  They lived two hours from me, and always took me in when things occasionally got rough at home since I was a teenager.  I'd visit in fair weather maybe 3-6 times a year, and when I needed a safe place to stay 0-2 times per year.  I also provided respite care before my uncle went to the nursing home on numerous occasions and was his tertiary power of his attorney.

My plan was to stay a few days, a couple of which would intersect with some cousins I'd never met, and then leave to go on a small vacation at the end of the week.  When my extended family got there, we hit it off, and I wanted to stay longer.  Our family is not very family-ey and it was something that felt really precious, to come together in hard times and be there for each other.

Besides, my aunt was trying to put too much on her plate—ferrying cousins to the nursing home two at a time (tail end of COVID), a vet appointment, a new puppy at home, and one of my cousins broke her phone and insisted on getting it fixed ASAP.  The night the family got there, my aunt started dropping hints about me leaving tomorrow and I didn't think much of it.  This was my second home, my family needed me, and she was probably just being humble.  I was gonna stay, and maybe even cancel my trip later in the week.  Maybe even stay until after everybody left so I could be there when my uncle passed.

But not budging from the notion that I'd be leaving, she put together a 6+ hour itinerary of how they could do everything without me.  It would have been five people and two animals in a hot van in the summer while somebody was dying.  I kept offering to take either the dog to the vet or the phone to the repair shop, along with two of the cousins to the nursing home.  The cousins were receptive, but my aunt insisted that they were all going with her without involving me.  Around noon, she corralled them all in her van and left.

I waited around in the house for about half an hour before the gravity of the situation sunk in and I started sobbing.  By two hours since they left, I packed up and went home.  I was still crying, all the time I doddled around the house trying to figure out what to do, then half the damn drive home.  I let my parents know what happened before leaving, which made things much worse as the whole extended family had blown up by the time I was home and there's still several mutual no contacts to this day.

I've tried to forgive my aunt several times over the past few years, but for a while trying to reassess the situation and my role in it made me MADDER, not closer to forgiveness.  I think that's finally changed.  I never accepted my aunt's apology from 2021, though I think I'm ready to now.  I just want to know, as I seek to make peace, was I also the asshole?

3,1c7niyk,AITA for refusing to pay money as a deceased estate executor for a demanded for funeral expense?,"AITA for the current situation: I am co executor of a deceased estate. The relative left no funeral instructions. My co executor and I met the funeral directors and they gave a quote. We literally had a sum of money pulled from the bank which funded the funeral. In my country, they are not cheap so we had $102 over. Unfortunately a relative started to argue a live music tribute. 

My co exec and I felt it wasn’t necessary as we had recorded music. I then got a phone call from my dad who said the live tribute was important to him so he’d pay out of his own pocket to ensure it happened. Given he agreed to pay, I felt we had no option so it proceeded. At no point did he say anything about being repaid. It was done, cash, no receipt.

 So I then get an email from the solicitor to say my father has approached them directly to seek payment for the live music. I directed the solicitor not to respond. I then got a text from my father asking me if he is a beneficiary because he wants a new car. I told him that I couldn’t discuss it because it was still pending court approval as a valid will. So once that process was completed, I had to have a very difficult conversation with him about not being a beneficiary. 

All though this, there was some very poor behaviour about it all. So my sister, fed up, gave him the $$$ and told him to drop it. Next thing, my dad gets wind of me asking the beneficiaries for their bank details. He sends me his! But he doesn’t know that I know he’s been paid the money. So I call it out! He denies any involvement but gives my sister back the $250 because “I’ll get it from the estate”. I have been incredibly disappointed by his behaviour, expectations and to be honest, lies. I don’t want to pay him $250 because he told me he wanted to cover it out of his own pocket, he never said he expected reimbursement. My co exec says let’s pay him to shut him up.

 Am I the asshole  for not wanting to pay him? The solicitor says I have a duty to the beneficiaries of which my father isn’t one but the $250 can be paid to him and the beneficiaries still get a reasonable amount of money. Am I the asshole people???",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,0.012592767,0,1
4,1c7nelw,WIBTA If my previous guardians get arrested?,"Hi, me again. So my previous post was a while back, and the guardians in question are the same from that one. Anyway, let's get into it.

So, I (f16) currently have a police investigation going on regarding an incident 2 years ago, and as a result of this investigation they're opening another one. 2 years ago I had a stillbirth, and my guardians at the time (f49 and m54) refused to take me to the hospital. Due to this, I almost died and its not on any of my records. I'm currently living in a Residential Children's Home, and they contacted the police about this. The first investigation is to me and my baby, and what happened there, and the second is on my previous guardians for suspicion of child abuse and neglect. 

WIBTA if they got done for it? I know that what they did was incredibly wrong, but I feel the need to protect them, and I know our family is going to have very strong opinions, and I will receive a lot of backlash from this despite the fact that I begged for this second investigation not to happen. Both investigations were opened on Monday and since then I haven't heard a word from any relatives aside from my bio mom (33f) and she spoke with my carers, who have refused to tell me what she said.

5,1c7nat6,AITA for my not stopping taking a shit for my grandma?,"Not sure if this qualifies as nsfw, but I do talk about medical history and bathroms and stuff so idk LOL

For context, my (F17) grandma (F62) has had some health problems in the past few years. She's   been diagnosed with diabetes, and last October just gotten a toe partially amputated because of it. Her recovery, however, has been great. She's back to the point where she can walk normally and regularly around the house, my grandpa has gotten her special shoes for walking, and by December she was able to travel outside, she seemed to be doing good.

Today, I came home from school and saw she was taking a nap on the couch. I went on the computer for a couple hours, then went to the bathroom to yk, shit. After like a minute I hear slamming on the door, my grandma saying ""LET ME IN."" I responded that I was using the bathroom and she yelled back she didnt care and to open the door. I said something like ""bruh one second"" the toilet is far from the door, so I finished shitting and opened the door before I washed my hands so she could go into the toilet/shower part of the bathroom (?) but she didnt come in. 

When I walked out she came storming out the bathroom down the hall saying she could've had an accident and she would made me clean it up, and that she knew I wasnt actually using the bathroom. Obviously I asked what she meant, and she went ""I heard you were humming, I know you were practicing for your stupid choir in there."" Atp I just laughed because thats ridiculous, and she stormed off. 

Later my Grandpa knocked on my door and started lecturing me about how she could've had an accident and how I should've been quicker. The time from the knocking to me opening the door must have been no more than 30 seconds, and I pointed that out and how there was a second bathroom 2 doors down. Then he said that this was my biggest problem, I lacked respect and should have jumped up to let her in due to her recent injury, checked on her before I went in, and most definitely not laughed at her lecture.

Now I feel like I should've done more for her? Was I the rude one here? She's seemed fine for months, and I stopped regularly caring for her because she's said she wants to be more self sufficient. Should I apologize? Or just leave it?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,0.012429365,0,1
6,1c7n4nf,AITA for giving my best friend’s cat creamy treats?,"My best friend asked me to look after his cat Mint for two weeks. He was in a hurry and forgot to pack Mint’s stuff. Before leaving on his business trip, he told me ‘No domestic brands, Whiskas or Meow Mix.’ I went to the pet store to buy food and toys for Mint, along with other supplies. I also decided to get her some nice treats.

During the two weeks, I let Mint have a total of three Toro creamy treat tubes. Made her happy enough to let me pet her.

When my friend returned from his trip, I handed him the toys and the remaining food. He asked how she’s been and I told her she’s been great. I mentioned that she liked the treats, in case he’d feel like getting her some.

He got upset about it. He said I should have asked him first ‘before feeding her something unnecessary’ especially since I knew his childhood cat had heath issues before his parents fed him too many treats. I did know of the diabetes and dental issues, having grown up with him, but I didn’t know that he doesn’t feed Mint treats.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,0.9847956,1,0
7,1c7md2v,AITA for stopping a friend from handing out valuables while he was inebriated?,"Context: Me and my friend (Jimmy) are both broke college-age students.

I have attended parties for a very long time, and am comfortable in them. In general, I try to be the big brother to people, always looking out for people close to me who may need guidance.

Jimmy on the other hand hasn't partied much, is sometimes awkward in social situations, and is subject to peer pressure.

Both me and Jimmy are good friends, with us commonly going out to eat, playing games, taking the same academic programs, etc.

I invited Jimmy for a night of partying, with him accompanying me to join my friend group for a pre-game, before later going to a large house party.

In the pregame, Jimmy got quite inebriated, with him consuming about 3-4 shots in 30 minutes. Jimmy seldom drinks and usually smokes weed. On the walk over, Jimmy also smoked a whole joint.

At this party Jimmy handed out his lighter to a random person, expecting to get this lighter back. The person started walking away with the lighter, and I turned to Jimmy and told him he was most definitely not going to get his lighter back as the person to whom he lent it was already gone.

I walked over to the guy before he got too far, got the lighter back from him, and gave it back to its rightful owner, Jimmy.

This upset Jimmy that I did this, however, at the time I didn't pick it up because he expressed it by just saying ""You're doing too much"". I was heavily inebriated at the time and will admit that I should've maybe caught onto the frustration.

As we began to round the troops up for the night and head home, me and Jimmy shared a cigarette. While we share this cigarette, a random woman walks up and begins flirting with Jimmy. Because Jimmy is inebriated and this girl is obviously trying to bum a cig off Jimmy, I tell him not to. Specifically, I say ""Don't just give your cigarettes to some random bitch, Jimmy. What are you doing"".

He gets mad in the moment and I reassure him that I was just trying to look out for him.

I didn't stop him because the goodies he was handing out were particularly expensive- however they are difficult to get and Jimmy does have limited money- but rather that Jimmy was possibly inebriated enough to the point his judgement was impaired, and I was making sure he wasn't doing anything he'd regret. This isn't something he'd do while sober.

A week later Jimmy sends me a long message stating that I was being an asshole for doing so.

8,1c7lof0,AITA for refusing to send my mom to his mom's?,"My 14yo son Caleb and I have grown very close over the last few years. That kid is my best bud. He has his moments but is such a selfless kid and doesn't mind dad giving him hugs. He actually asked for PetCo gift cards for his birthday so he could buy animal supplies and donate them to the local animal shelter.

His mom and I divorced when he was 7. We hate each other but I don't interact with her as much. She's a bitter ex who still complains about our failed marriage. My son recently told her to stop bad mouthing me because she's far from perfect herself. Plus it upset him. She agreed.

Well she badmouthed me on her social media by saying the happiest day of her life was when we divorced. Caleb saw the post and refused to go back to her house. She and I have 50/50 but Caleb comes and goes as he pleases. He has rarely seen her and refuses to talk to unless he has to talk to her (ie grades) for a month.

I do provide her with updates. Mostly that he's fine. She's asking me to send him back to her place so they can work things out. I refused. I owe her nothing. She's badmouthed me for years as this horrible person so screw her.

9,1c7ln7v,AITA: Respect between parent and child ,"AITA: I’m a 21 y/o male living with my Mom & her fiancée. I’m currently a full time student, unemployed currently, coming off a job of two years as a store manager, looking for a part time job. I came home today from school, and did homework for about three hours. When my mother came home, I was taking a break from homework, sitting on my bed, and playing some games. She came into my room, and flipped out, because I hadn’t done the dishes yet. I said I was sorry, and that I would’ve already had them done if she had asked me to do them. After she left my room, she started texting me saying (and I quote), “If you were smart you would have shut your game off and jumped up to do the dishes.  Your sense of entitlement is exactly why I have no sympathy for you and dont buy your bullshit. You have the balls to give me an attitude laying in your bed playing a game.  Im beyond frustrated with you “ I responded, “If you wanted to me to do the dishes you should have asked me to do them. I would have gladly done them for you.” I can see how this would be interpreted as sarcasm, so I understand her frustration, however, she responded: “are you fucking dumb? YOU CLEARLY DONT SPEAK ENGLISH “ Now, the rest of this argument goes on for too long but feel free to ask for details you want elaborated on.

This is an ongoing issue for us, it feels like I am not being treated with respect on the level of a normal person, and I express that, only to be told I am being entitled and disrespectful. It has been going on for so long I no longer know what to think. Is it entitled of me to ask to be spoken to politely?  Not in like a professional sense, but without raising of the voice or confrontational phrasing, and to be informed of tasks I need to do beforehand? Am I the asshole? 

I generally do the most chores around the house, often without being asked, and I’ve never had an issue with that because she doesn’t make me pay rent (I handle all of my other expenses.) I hate to act like this is anywhere near as important as other things going on in the world but I need answers at this point. Thank you for your time.

Edit: I didn’t see the dishes when I walked in. I guess I should’ve checked before starting my homework

Edit 2: I felt I should add additional context that I take for granted. Generally, I buy my own food, eat on my own and use disposable tableware. I mostly stay in my room as to not get in the way of my mother’s relationship.

11,1c7lc92,AITA for trying to fix an argument with a friend before Christmas?,"
So last December, I (M18) had a friend, L, (F17) who I got Secret Santa for. She would be very rude, unfriendly and make jokes towards my relationship with my gf (F19) but would play it off as playful jabbing. 

 So, for Christmas my gf helped, and I got L a plushie that she has been wanting for months. While I thought she liked it, she went to my gf behind my back and said that I did not care “enough” about her because I put it in a plastic Walmart bag. I did not have the money nor the time to get her a holiday bag - it took me enough of my paycheck to get this plushie. L is very much a ‘if you have a problem with me, come talk to me’ person so I was confused why she didn’t talk to ME. L got upset when I asked her to talk about it and said I need to learn how to keep our relationship and friendships with others separate. She ended up giving half of an apology. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole. L kept her distance from me, and refused to talk about me, and I didn’t want to have any issues within our friend group before Christmas so I thought it would be a good idea to try and talk to her about why it feels like she doesn’t like me. L got defensive immediately and started ranting about how she feels outcasted in our friendship, and all she wants is a friend group with no relationship to start drama. I was confused and explained to her how she was the one causing conflicts while my gf and I stay ed back and watched it happen and/or would take blame to make the situations less tense. L grew more angrier at me and blocked me but started texting my gf instead and told her how much we fucked up and that their friendship was only just a label. 

She also lied and said she would not bring in our other mutual friends, but I got several text messages and even kicked out of a group chat without any reason why. Recently, I’ve had a few of our mutual friends apologize for ghosting me and explain how it isn’t right what happened, which left me wondering if I’m truly in the wrong.

13,1c7l63c,AITA For Making My College-Aged Daughter Cover Her Own Entertainment & Off-Campus Food Budget?,"AITA for telling my 19 year old college student she needs to cover her own “extra” expenses like eating out off campus, clothing and toiletries?  I am a full-time single mom (raised her 100% on my own) and am paying her tuition, housing, campus dining plan, books and supplies, medical insurance, let her use my car, pay her car insurance, phone bill etc.  Unlike me, she will graduate with zero student debt.   She has a part time job and earns $300-$400 a month, which in my view is more than fine to cover “extras.”    

Yes, I can afford to cover those “extras.”  I just don’t want to.  I grew up broke and had to pay my own way through college and grad school and had student debt coming out my ears until i was 35.  My parents contributed exactly zero to college because they could barely support themselves.  Honestly, I’m grateful because it taught me to understand the value of a dollar and taught me to work my ass off. 

I think it’s important that she “owns” at least this part of her college experience.   I also think it’s important that she learns to budget and that she learns the difference between “wants” and “needs.”   You really only learn that when you are spending your own money.  Finally, I think it’s important that she learns what it’s like to “go without.”   Or to choose between going out to eat with friends vs buying a new pair of pants.  To want something and not be able to afford it so you either save up or live without.   

I was very successful professionally and also a smart investor (while also being very frugal and financially conservative my whole life) so she has always had every single thing she needed - she just wasn’t spoiled.  She has always been a hard worker and not entitled.   She has always done her part around the house while growing up without an attitude and without complaining, even as a teenager.   But I think she needs to start experiencing living the life she can afford - not the life her mom can afford after a successful 30+ year career.   

I think that’s good parenting.  She thinks I’m being an unreasonable cheapskate asshole.  AITA?

We live separately, have no kids/pets/property, all our stuff has been claimed by the rightful owner. The vintage record collection in question is the only point of contention.

Now, I’ll admit my family’s mistreatment of STBX and me being conflict avoidant and not advocating for her like I should have is one of the main factors behind our divorce. I’m definitely TA for that and I take full responsibility. I know she deserves better. That’s why we’re no longer together.

My late aunt left me her vintage record collection. STBX admired this collection even while my aunt (who was among one of her tormentors) was alive. STBX has asked me many times if I would be willing to part with a few pieces from the record collection to give to her, which I’m not.

15,1c7kuul,WIBTA for encouraging my brother not to give up after having a stroke and losing his job?,"I recently received a type written letter from my brother which hasn’t been sitting right with me.

The situation is as the title explains. Several years ago my brother suffered from a stroke, which was unexpected as he was extremely fit and still relatively young at 38 years old at the time. That in combination with an old head injury he’d suffered in the mid aughts was enough for him to be deemed unable to return to his work and he was ultimately let go from active duty.  

This was devastating to him. He loved his job. He was also suddenly unable to do a lot independently and needed rehabilitation therapy and psychological therapy. He’s doing much better now, even walking fairly well again. 

Thing is he’s been stagnant here for a while. I know how important feeling accomplished was for him and as a man I feel it gives a sense of purpose to provide, not simply survive on whatever is offered. He lives a different lifestyle than myself, but no man wants to be wholly financially dependent on another, and I know my brother would like to contribute fairly. I’ve always encouraged him to keep forging ahead, though it seems I’ve not been taken kindly.

Essentially he wrote to me because he wanted time to collect his thoughts and felt he needed to say what he needed without interruption. It is still a challenge for him to follow conversation or speak for long periods of time, so I understand. He felt that my encouragement was at times  demeaning to him and his situation. He said he’s happy with what he has contributed and with where he is at. He doesn’t feel the need to always push towards achieving more and it’s damaging to him when he’s pushing himself that way and it is better for him to take each day on at a time and celebrate his small accomplishments without high expectations. 

I worry he’s feeling he won’t get any better, and just fallen complacent. My wife doesn’t want me to bring this up with him, she feels it is not encouraging.

17,1c7kp8y,AITA for bugging my (24M) GF (26F) to find a job?,"We have been together since 2.5 years. We met in college but she graduated a year late as she had to repeat some classes. Ever since her graduation, she has only worked for 5 continuous months, part-time; where, she was eventually let go because of poor work performance. In the meantime, I have worked for about 2 years and I am currently pursuing grad school and will be out of here within the next year.  
  
That said, after she was laid off in January, she has made very limited efforts in finding a new job. To be specific, she applies to, on average 10 jobs/week, and does not do any form of interview preparation or skill training. Furthermore, her efforts have progressively reduced in the last 3 weeks.  
  
I have been conscious about her lack of efforts and periodically involved myself in her business to get things moving. For example, I asked her for LinkedIn account details and did networking on her behalf for about 3-5 days, in the hopes that she would pick it up after I hand it back to her. Another example, I, on her request, created an excel practice sheet (really good - lmk if someone needs one and I can share it) so that she could start to learn excel for her job interviews. After multiple promises from her to get it done within a couple of days, she failed to act on her promise and it's been 3 weeks since.  
  
In terms of our living situation, she lived in my very little studio in the city where I used to work before grad school. Currently, we both share an apartment and she is funding her living through parental support.  
  
The worst part is that I am losing my patience and a little bit of respect for her. We are both non-citizens in the US on student visa and thus, if nothing works out soon, she would need to head back to our home country at least for a year i.e., until she can get into a grad school. I have asked her, multiple times, to apply for grad schools (as it is in her future plans) but she refuses to do so because she has a undergrad GPA slightly above 3. My rebuttal has always been that people who get low or very low GPAs don't end up doing nothing and that, there is always a path forward.  
  
Here's my conflict - I am someone who cares about quality effort more than the result. I don't care if she gets a job or not but, I do care about the effort she puts in. I voiced it out to her today (and have done so about 3-4 times in 2024) during a fight and she blatantly lied to me about her efforts of finding a job. All said and done, I am not sure on what to do? I am being controlling, I know, but I want her to achieve what she says she wants to achieve in life.  
  
TLDR: Am I the A\*\*hole for pestering her with this? How long should I bear with her stuff, eventhough I genuinely love her but have a feeling that the 'love' symbol has question marks all around it.",Asshole,2024-04-19,1.0,1.0211169,1,1
18,1c7klc7,AITA My mother cancelled my birthday for a girls trip.,"I know from the title that it doesn't sound very bad... However, I 17 female asked my mother for a birthday party, as I hadn't had one in 9 years. For some context, I have two younger siblings, and every year they have huge sleepover parties with their friends (12–20 people each time). I do not have very many friends, as my mother has control over a lot of who I can and cannot talk to, so I was only wanting to invite four people to this party. 

I talked with my mum, and she said I could have one, but I noticed she had already invited her friends to my own party (which isn't a big deal), except when I went to invite my four people, she blew up on me, telling me I should've talked to her first about the party (which I had already done the day prior). She then told me that she had booked my birthday to go out of town with her girl friends just an hour ago, and I could no longer have a party. 

I was devastated and tried to talk to her about how upset this made me and my past experiences with my birthday (no one showing up) and how she's essentially doing the same thing. She then told me that I was gaslighting and abusing her, that I would definitely not get a birthday anymore, and that I wasn't going to get a gift anyways because she had booked flights to Fiji with my stepdad and couldn't afford something for me if she wanted to have her trip. 

My boyfriend said I could have my party at his house, and I turned it down because I thought this year would be different, but I'm beginning to see otherwise and regret turning his offer down. I just wanted to have a birthday where I wasn't making my own cake.  
I can't seem to understand where I went wrong here for my mother to be throwing around such terms...

She tried to get a puppy on her own but she was almost scammed out of her money, luckily for her my Mom and her brother stepped in and found out that it was a scam. My Aunt fell into a deeper depression after that and told my Mom that she didn't want a dog when my mom said that she could get my aunt one. But even after being told no, my mom and my uncle still got my aunt an 8 week old Micro doodle puppy. I used to have a hard time smiling but the moment I saw the Puppy, I felt my heart melt immediately. I held the puppy in my arms the whole entire time and when we got to my aunt's house.I felt my heart breaking when I realized that I had to leave her. We stayed for the night and left in the afternoon. But on the road I kept feeling like I was about to cry for the puppy that wasn't mine. However a week later I was in my room on my phone, when I learned that my mom was going to go pick the puppy up from my Aunt. I felt myself melt with joy but also concern for the puppy. My mom brought the pup to my room and told me that she was my responsibility. You ever get the feeling that if we're a child and your parents had just given you a present that you loved to death? Yeah that's how I felt about seeing the puppy being handed to me for my care. And through the week I took care of the puppy, played, took her out to use the bathroom, fed and even when as far as to plan our future together with her being my baby forever but unfortunately, my Aunt decided that she wanted my puppy again. However I didn't want to since I was just starting to settle in with her as mine and felt myself started to cry when my mom told me that my aunt wanted her back.i told my mom that I didn't want to get rid of the puppy and that it was unfair to just give me something that finally made me feel complete but then take it away a week later. My Mom said that she won't force me to give the puppy (Her Name is Lily) back. Another week goes by and my aunt calls me today when I was outside with Lily. She was sobbing and telling me that she wanted Lily back and how lonely she was which made me feel guilty about my emotions and caused me to start crying. I told her that I would talk to my parents about it and hung up. When I told my dad what she did. He got upset at my aunt and texted my mom about what she did. My mom Texted my Dad back telling him that she wanted me to block my aunt since I had her number saved.

I wouldn't say we're close, like we go months without talking and have only hung out maybe 5-6 times in 4 years but i trust them enough or I did.

Anyway I sensed issues with me and another friend (Lucy) developed issues and after a refusal to talk about it I distanced myself. Immediately weird things started happening and I suspected it to be Lucy but every time I told Jane she would defend Lucy no matter how convincing the evidence, basically making it seem as if I was crazy for accusing her. At one point she even stated ""Honestly Lucy doesn't care about you enough to do this"". Soon after she stated that I found out it was in fact Lucy and still she's trying to make excuses and 'wrap her head around it'. I showed her everything and she looked into it trying to find a reason it couldn't be Lucy and we she couldn't she said she didn't want to get involved.

21,1c7k4s7,AITA for calling my work-teammate unprofessional because of her puppy?,"I (M27) am working towards getting my PhD, so in addition to the other roles I have at the university, I'm leading several projects with a core team of 7 members. Back in late January, one of the ladies on the team went on maternity leave, and then another left for maternity leave as well in early March. 

Because of this, our team has been stretched pretty thin. I understand this, so I've been setting less ambitious objectives for our team so the remaining 5 of us are not overwhelmed. In late February, the newest member of the lab, Chole (F27), took in a 5-week-old puppy (Bean). 

Chole joined the lab back in December (she needs to research for her master's degree). Before she joined, I'd known her for almost 4 years. Here's where the problem is. Since getting Bean, Chole has been consistently coming late to meetings, missing her deadlines, and leaving early. I've been having to take extra time after hours to ensure that she's in the loop. Chole says all this is because of Bean and how much work he requires, since according to her, ""he's a baby."" 

Chole seems to have taken offense with the fact that the two ladies have been given maternity leave while she didn't get time off for her dog. It's a whole thing with her that since she's childfree and all, but I won't get into it. About 2 weeks ago, Chole asked me if it was ok for her to bring Bean to the office since according to her, ""he gets upset and fussy when he's alone."" 

Since the school doesn't have a policy forbidding this and nobody else on the team objected, I allowed it. The dog has been ridiculous here. It constantly barks and whines, has made a mess on the floor more than once, but the worst thing is that it starts peeing when it sees me (or other people) and tries to run over to them while peeing. It has a crate, but whenever it whines constantly in it if it isn't sleeping. 

Once he's out of the crate, he acts like he's in the Olympics or something. Running around in all directions trying to take the shoes off my feet, etc. Chole has been doing less work as she spends so much time feeding, cleaning, or trying to persuade Bean to sleep. One of the professors noticed this as well, and he told me to give her a warning before the situation got out of hand. 

I did (on Tuesday). I told her that keeping Bean in the office was untenable and that she'd need to find some alternative. She protested, but I insisted, and she seemed very upset with this. Wednesday, Chole didn't come in since she didn't want to leave Bean alone. 

Today she only showed up for a bit and then headed out. I didn't bother speaking with her, and just a few hours ago, after work, she called me and said I was being an asshole for not advocating for her and Bean. I've decided not to escalate this since she is clearly under a lot of stress, but I did tell her that she was being unprofessional and needed to pull up her socks before her supervisor got involved.

23,1c7jw76,AITA for not giving my Dasher $200 to get his car back?,"About a week ago, I (28M) ordered Taco Bell via DoorDash around midnight and when my Dasher got to my complex, he couldn’t find my apartment. DoorDash sent me an automated message saying that he couldn’t find my apartment and I should try calling or texting him. I didn’t see that message for five minutes, but when I did, I called and texted him to no response.
So I walked out and heard some commotion in the hallway. I found the Dasher looking confused talking to some of my neighbors who had just got home. I asked him (the Dasher) if he was looking for me and gave him my apartment number. He gave me my order. I thanked him and started walking towards my apartment when my neighbor said “His car got totaled!” (I later found out she meant towed) In shock, I said “Like, just now?” She said “Yeah. While he was looking for you!” I went back into my apartment, dropped off my food, grabbed my shoes and went outside to see if there was anything I could do to help. 
The Dasher then told me that when he got there, he parked in the fire lane and someone had towed his vehicle. I felt kinda bad and I offered to drive him to finish his deliveries (he had one more and it was close to where I lived) and drive him to the tow truck company. He got mad because he wanted me to give him $200 to get his car out. I told him I couldn’t do that and that it’s not my fault for what happened to him. I again offered to drive him to where he needed to go and he declined my help saying he didn’t need transportation, he needed money as he is a broke college student trying to get money by doing DoorDash at late hours to pay his bills. He ended up calling an Uber. 
Two days later, he came to my apartment and again asked for money. I told him that, if he comes to my apartment again, I will call the police because this is harassment. 
Am I in the wrong here? I talked to my family and friends about this and some of them said that I should’ve went to an ATM to get him $200 in cash and me offering to give him a ride was actually insulting and not helpful at all.

24,1c7jr01,AITA for saying no to adding a third roommate ?,"I (21F) share a tiny 2 bedroom apartment with a friend (23F). We are both college students, and she is moving to another state with her partner (we will call “Partner”) at the end of the lease. 

She recently texted me asking if it was okay for Partner to stay with us for the rest of the lease, (4 months). I was not comfortable with this so I politely said no, stating that I wasn’t comfortable adding a 3rd roommate to the apartment, and also the lease agreement specifically states that no guest can stay for longer than 2 weeks. 

For context, since she is graduating and I have one more year to go, I tried asking the landlord if I could stay in this apartment, but with a new roommate. It did not go well. The whole situation turned into a nightmare, and the landlord was verbally abusive toward me, and I just got really scared of having to interact with them again. I feel like they are now looking for any reason to keep our security deposit. I managed to secure a new apartment for next year, but I just want to finish out this lease with no issues.

My roommate replied that she was surprised I said no, and brought up the fact that I have had my own boyfriend stay over many times in the past. However, the longest he ever stayed over was 19 days, which only happened once. Most of the time, he only stayed over around 3 days and this was with weeks of a gap in between. Whenever he visited me, he always had another place to live, so if my roommate had ever been concerned about him staying with me (which she did not), it would have been no issue to have him leave. But if Partner stays with us, they would have no other place to go and I would be stuck with them here full time for 4 months. 

We went back and forth, and I made it clear that I was not okay with breaking the rules or having Partner here for that much time. However, my roommate said she would have Partner here for 2 weeks at a time with a day in between, arguing that this would fix the problem of breaking the rules. I said that even if that fixed the problem (it is still breaking rules), I am not comfortable with Partner being here for so long. I told her that not consulting me in such a big decision about our shared space was hurtful. I pay half of the rent, so I have the right to say no to taking on an extra roommate I did not consent to. My roommate has the right to do the same, and I would have no choice but to respect her wishes. My roommate said that she would never tell me that I can’t have someone over and can’t say for how long, especially if it is a romantic partner. However, I feel that it does not matter who it is, if your roommate is uncomfortable with having a 3rd person live here (for free btw), you have to respect their wishes. She is putting her foot down, saying she will have Partner stay here whether I am okay with it or not.
I will also note that this entire conversation took place over text, I asked to speak on the phone but she refused.

We don't have ""retire now"" money by any means, but we are very secure.

My brother, however, has very little. He's certainly not without fault for this, but he does also have mental health issues. I could get into more detail here, but the long and short of it is he is consistently paycheck-to-paycheck and relies on the people around him a staggering amount when it comes to money (IE: He asked a friend of his if he could have some of their airline points).

A few weeks back, maybe a day or two after we had a very good conversation about how he was doing (I was really impressed with things he was saying specifically about how he's treating his mental health), he sent me a text saying that he was embarrassed to do this, but that his phone was shut off and he needs about $150 to get it turned back on, that he'd quickly pay me back, etc. I sent him the money immediately, though I did feel conflicted about doing so.

A few days after that, I'd texted him a funny thing that was sort of an inside joke to the two of us when growing up. I got nothing back. He's since texted, but no mention of the money of course. I really and truly do not expect nor need him to pay that money back, but I can't lie and say that I'm not bothered by the radio silence on his end. At the same time, I can understand he might be embarrassed or feel weird because he 'owes' me money.

Anyway, here's where I feel like the AH: I feel like I can no longer help him financially at all. I really don't think bailing him out is helping him at all. I struggle with this decision, but at the same time- I feel like an asshole for having thoughts creep into my head about how truthful he's being about why he needs the money, etc. At the same time, it's $50 bucks here or $150 there - it's never been a huge ask (over the past 6-8 months, I've probably sent him \~$500 total - some of which he did not ask for).

I feel like it's a bit of damned if you do, damned if you don't situation here - but my plan as of now for the next time he asks is to ask him what he's doing with his money before sending him anything else, and letting him know that whatever he's asking for, I'd send him some extra and say it's a all a gift - but that I cannot do so anymore after that. Unfortunately, this also makes me feel like a bit of an asshole (why do I need to know about his finances?).

29,1c7jav9,AITA for getting pissed at my friends for calling me Autistic? ,"I (NB17) have been diagnosed with ADHD since I was around 8 years old. It's noticeably internally effected my life in the later years since my understanding of ADHD grew. This really helped me, because there's a lot of habits I have that I realise ""Ah, I do this because of my ADHD"" which can put my mind to rest often. 

Practically every single friend of mine knows I have ADHD, and personally I don't mind talking about my experiences, I love when people genuinely ask about ADHD rather than assuming things. 

From what I'm aware of, but feel free to correct me, ADHD can have (but not always) similar symptoms to Autism, people I talk to question whether I'm Autistic , which I don't mind, I simply tell them ""I'm not sure, I'm yet to be tested"" since that's the truth. 

I don't like self diagnosing (for myself) because personally I'd much rather have the perspective of a professional, but I don't invalidate anyone who has a self diagnosis, I understand how hard it is to get a diagnosis since I've been on the waiting list for around 7 years now. 

However, recently I've found that a lot of people in my social circles throw around the phrase ""Are you Autistic? / You're autistic"" in a more joking way. But, my friends use those terms on me a lot because of my behaviour / habits. 

One time I can remember is once I was in a call with friends and I was stimming by flapping my arms, and one of my friends said ""OP is acting Autistic again"" and I do NOT stay quiet about it, I usually say stuff like ""ADHD people can stim too?"" and they'd respond with ""I wouldn't be surprised if you're Autistic though"" or something along those lines. Or if I say ""I'm not autistic"" they'd say ""Yeah I'm sure / Whatever you say"" in a sarcastic way. 

At first, it was all fun and games, I didn't really care, but eventually I felt invalidated, and maybe I'm just being sensitive for that, but I didn't feel seen for my ADHD it's just ""Oh that's Autism"" 

At one point I had a conversation with my friend where I said ""I'm not Autistic"" in a serious way, and my friend responds ""You are though"" whether they were joking or not it made my blood boil, I'm very short tempered so anything can set me off. 

There have been times I've made conversations awkward by not just sucking up the joke like a sponge, I'd say ""I'm not autistic, I have adhd"" in quite a stern and frustrated voice. 

After putting up with it for months, I'm just sick of hearing it, I have ADHD, I'm not Autistic, I've expressed many times that my actions are most likely part of my ADHD, but they simply keep calling me Autistic. 

My social anxiety? Autism. Getting excited over a hyperfixation? Autism. Stimming? Autism.

I'm not saying getting called autistic is a bad thing, it's just very frustrating when I'm not autistic, and I've clearly expressed how I don't like to be called autistic. 

At the same time, I have a very short temper so I may be over reacting, and I could be getting uneccisarily angry over a joke

I am a cardiology resident. My schedule is tricky to say the least. So I could only arrange to get time off for a few days after the Ava's mom's NSTEMI. I told Ava I couldn't come right away but I should be able to make it after a few days. 

Not to mention I haven't seen ANYONE from her family in person. And even the idea of meeting her republican conservative family with 3 brothets freaks me out. (They know Ava likes women and accept her but still, I am so scared) Depite that, I arranged to go.

Ava is overly pissed and said I am not making the effort to be beside her in these horrible days. I made it to Texas yesterday, and she is still being cold towards me, not talking to me at all, and ignoring me. AITA?

31,1c7ibwg,AITA for asking my neighbour to stop horking up his spit outside?,"I just moved into my boyfriends place and have noticed immediately that the new renter next door sits outside almost all day and night. Mostly at night until like 1am then out again at 5am, then periodically all throughout the day. He smokes and that’s fine but he’s literally horks up and I mean HORKS up mucus constantly. It makes me feel physically sick to my stomach. It’s not just once or twice, it will be like 15 times in 5 minutes and he literally sounds like he is gagging to vomit then spits it out on the ground.

I really want to say something respectfully but he is not approachable and has not been friendly in our attempts to say hi. I just don’t want to make it worse lol.

AITA for leaving him a note asking to respectfully not do that right outside my bedroom window and also right next to our deck and hot tub. 

I was going to leave a note with a little doobie or something (in Canada) as I know they smoke it up. Lol but not sure if it’ll just piss me off more if he doesn’t at least cut down on it lol.

32,1c7i8t7,AITA For passing out missing person flyers?,"Sorry for any typos.

My neighbor, (fake name) Jackson, (14M) recently went missing in early March.  My mom made some flyers for his parents, who are genuinely nice people. I (14F) wanted to help by passing out some of the flyers up at my school.

So my mom  was supposed to print some of the flyers for me to take to school, which had been approved by the police department. It was a basic flyer, with his photo and info. Including the departments number. She had forgotten to print them and sent me it digitally, I take a photography class so I decided I would just ask him to print a few out for me.

So, my school does A and B days and that day I didn't have photography so I went to him during advisory passing period to ask if I could come by during lunch to have something printed, he agreed so I came back during lunch. When he saw what it was he didnt refuse and just asked questions. He ended up printing 10, I kept all 10 copies. 

I wanted to go to my counselor to ask him to help me pass them out, or if I was even allowed to. He wasn't there so I asked another counselor who said he was out sick. So I gave her 1 of the flyers then went to the attendance lady and gave her one before doing my own thing. 

Around 10-20 minutes later my school's security guard came up to me and brought me to the attendance office. He said I wasn't allowed to do that. He said that 1, they couldn't prove the flyers were real because there was no way to tell the police department had approved it, 2, they couldn't prove that Jackson was even apart of the school district, and 3, that staff weren't allowed to print anything that wasn't school related. Which is a rule I had NEVER heard about before. He said the my photography teacher wouldn't get in trouble but would if it happened again.

I told my mom the story today and she's pissed about it, she said that doing that wasn't his right.  She plans on emailing my counselor about it and taking it up with him. My dad says I did everything right, and that I shouldn't have been scolded.

33,1c7hmrk,AITA for telling my friend her ADHD sensitivity is not real?,"I invited my friend to go with me to see an art exhibition. After several weeks of trying to organise a day and time, we finally found a weekend when we were both free. I told her to advise me by Friday when she wanted to go and confirm the details with me (this part is important).

I never heard back from her and I assumed she changed her mind but on the Sunday morning she messaged me with two hours notice and I couldn't go because I was unwell and didn't even see the message until later.
She began to send passive aggressive messages about how I had no regard for her feelings and the least I could have done was respond to her immediately. I wasn't in the mood for her BS so I didn't respond.
She then proceeded to record a video and uploaded it to social media basically calling me a lousy friend who ""disrespects"" her and followed it up with a written post. I should add, she said I used my medical condition as an excuse not to respond. This was not the case.

I waited a few days before contacting her and basically said ""You cannot make plans at the last minute and expect people to be available. Also, you humiliated me on social media and tried to minimise my medical condition which is very real. I have tolerated your excessive tardiness, constant cancelling, excessive emotional outbursts and never complained to all our friends.""

Her response was ""I have ADHD sensitivity so I react differently to you and your reaction proves you are not a supportive friend"". That is when I told her that her ADHD sensitivity was not real but an excuse for her bad behaviour. I should also mention that she is a grown ass woman who self diagnosed and managed to convince doctors she has ADHD but refuses to take medication.

34,1c7hfzk,WIBTA if I tricked my friend to figure out why she did not join our plans?,"Okay, so for reference, my friend and I (teenagers F) are making plans for this week. We want to do something afterschool, and we invited the entire friend group with 4 other people. 3 people immediately replied that they could not come, while one did not reply. After a day, we messaged the friend who did not yet reply, we will call her ""Steph"", asking if they were coming. She told us, that yes, she was free that afternoon. And so with that, we messaged everyone who was coming to inform them of the details of what we were planning on doing. ""Steph"" then told us that she wasn't sure if she could come yet and that they had to ask their parent. After 2 days, Steph had not told us whether or not she was planning on coming. After asking again, she told us that she couldn't come. One of my friends privately asked why, and Steph replied with a vague excuse about how they needed to catch up on other work. It was something that they had a long time to do, and she did not have a real commitment or excuse.

Next, for some context, Steph is really close with ""Charlie."" They are constantly together, and they often branch away from the group, and you cannot talk to one without the other one there. We respect that they are close, but it sometimes gets annoying when you can't spend time with one of them alone. They either both go to events together, or neither one comes

Charlie is one of the ones who immediately replied that they couldn't come. And after hearing that Steph decided not to come (not couldn't come), our first thought for why was because Charlie wasn't coming. I didn't want to directly ask Steph for the reason why she wasn't coming, as we have brought up this issue before, and they got defensive. However, we still wanted to know if Steph wasn't coming because of Charlie.

Here is where we might be the A-holes: We have not done it yet, but my 2 friends and I wanted to talk in front of Steph about how 4 of us would be going to hangout, and imply that the 4th was Charlie (the only 3 going are my 2 friends and I. The outcome of this would be to see if Steph would try to change her plans, or to ask us about Charlie to confirm if she was coming.

Would this be toxic/manipulative? We have addressed the clinginess between the 2 friends to them before, but the problem has not gotten better, it might have even worsened.

  
Edit: After reading all the comments, we do agree with what everyone is saying. We have no problem with them being close with each other at all but the issue is that, when they’re together with us in a group setting, they ignore everyone but each other. We have brought this up with them but they still do not see any issue with it. ",Asshole,2024-04-18,1.0,1.0673456,1,1
35,1c7hftr,AITAH for being ungrateful for $180 Passover dinner,"I apologize if there is little to no grammar in this message, I am using voice to text because I am very angry and aggravated by the situation. Me and my dad live 10 hours away from each other because I decided to move to Ohio with my mom when I was 18 during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Since then I do back-and-forth trips three times a year to go visit my dad and other side of the family. When I’m not doing those back-and-forth trips, my dad likes to send me food. Since I could remember, my dad has always been an extreme conservative Republican. He has always been trying to push his political beliefs onto me since I was a little kid and I always went with it because I didn’t know any better, but now I want to be able to make my own choices. Ever since the thing in Israel started happening my dad put up in Israel flag in front of his house,bought a yarmulke, and is trying to convince everybody that he is Jewish. A little bit of information he has never practiced Jewish teachings and is baptized Catholic. Today my dad texted me and asked me what my address was so I told him with my address was assuming that he wanted it to send me food so I told him Dad me and my family just got back from a restaurant we don’t want food right now. My dad ended up sending me $180 worth of food from a New York deli for Pass over on Monday. That $180 meal consisted of pounds of brisket, gefilte fish, matzoh, ball, soup, gravy, mashed potatoes, and other things. And now here is where I feel like the asshole. Because I live with my mom it is being sent to my mothers house and although it is all pre-cooked, my mom hast to go to work she does not have time to cook pounds and pounds of food all day. We do not actively practice religion. I my dad sent me a $180 Jewish meal full of food that I have never had in my life that I have never plan to have,because all of it seems rather disgusting. I’m not insulting anybody who’s Jewish or likes any of the foods I just listed but I personally don’t. So I told my dad many times in the nicest way possible basically explain to him how we don’t have time to cook this meal. We don’t have any place to put it. We don’t have the people to eat it because it feeds from 6 to 9 people and we are a house of four and I basically told him that nobody in this house is Jewish we don’t celebrate Jewish holidays we don’t have that day off. We don’t have time to cook it and I told him to just cancel the order. He was really difficult basically saying that he can’t cancel the order and to just give it to a needy family or throw it in the garbage, and then he made me feel bad saying that he thought I was better than this and that it doesn’t matter if I’m not Jewish I should eat it because it is Jewish and because it’s a good food from a really nice and very expensive deli.

36,1c7h0ix,AITA for not mowing my neighbors yard??,"Context- I’ve lived next to these neighbors for years and we’ve never really had issues besides a few times they’ve parked in our driveway (we live on opposite sides of an entire street so it was completely uncalled for). These are ultra clean freaks, though. I’ve seen him on multiple occasions scrubbing individual rocks of his driveway with a toothbrush, pressure wash his outdoor trash bin, trim bushes with scissors, etc. like super weird people. 

Last week they decided to go on a vacation and called us to let us know and ask to watch over their house. We agreed. We didn’t see anything unusual and even made sure their packages were out of the rain. They have 4 outdoor cameras so it’s not like they couldn’t see what was up anyways. Over the past week we’ve had a lot of rain where we’re located so the grass grew a lot. They moved the day they left and it grew to about 5 inches. 

Anyway, they got home yesterday and called us to let us know. We thought nothing of it and asked how their trip was. We were friendly and chatted for a while about their vacation yada yada. Then they say “wouldve been nice if we came home to a nice yard, but I see you didn’t care to do anything nice for us.” Excuse me?? There were branches in their yard which we gladly moved when we moved the ones that fell in ours, but mowing your grass…? We told them it wasn’t really a priority for us as we work full time, they’re retired and it’s not even our house? 

It’s important to mention, our property line doesn’t cross, we literally have a road between our houses. So it’s not like it’s just running the mower over ours and just connecting theirs. We would actually have to walk the mower across the street and mow it. They’ve mowed for us twice when we were sick. Other times they’ve literally called the city on us to get us fined for having “too long of grass” yet they want us to mow theirs??? Right… AITA??",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,0.06258546,0,1
37,1c7gv5u,AITA for not apologizing to my (28M) friend (45F) about a behaviour I did not engage in?,"We had plans for next month, but my cousin had to change his wedding day (drama with the location) and he is getting married on the same day. I wrote to her ""bad news, my cousin's wedding is on X day"" and a crying face. She responded: ""I saw it coming. Enjoy"" and a kiss face. I asked what she meant. She goes on a long rant about how she just felt that I was going to be making plans to watch the music festival with someone else. I told her I had plans with her. I was not understanding where all of this was coming from, she was saying I must have misunderstood what she meant... So she said it was better to talk in person once i was back and this what she said:

In October I said something rude to her and starting walking without her. When we where in the gym, I climbed the stairs two steps at a time leaving her behind. I told her that I always do that. (It's my stupid ritual thing in the gym, I always climb the stairs two steps at once). 

Now. After that she told me I was supportive After a while apparently I went again to act annoyed with her and ""mistreating her"".I was shocked, i felt so bad. I asked about what I said, or the when I was rude, but she could not really point it out. Apparently I behaved like this for a while. But yet again, not one example where I said something, only how I made her feel.

In our trip, she tells me I was angry. I dont remember being angry or annoyed, I actually was pretty calm and had a good time. She told me that this has been going on for a long time I then asked for specifics. I was given one exemple where i got the food out of a five guys bag in a rude way. At some point during the trip she was doing something slowly and I angry yelled at her. No details as to what was she doing, or where were we (underground or hotel). 

She is not just not the kind to make this up out of nowhere, but I also know I did not behave that way. I don't ""angrily"" snap at people. She started crying again and i went ""Is just I am not really sure what how to continue, sorry."" to which she responded by ""well, not gaslighting me"". And that really angered me. I mean, we were only having that conversation because I am the one who asked what is going on. I did asked her as to why she did not mention this before and it was because we had the trip and did not want us to fight before that (7 months, since october)

A couple of weeks before the trip, she asked me to go costume shopping with her, we had manicures, lunch... We see each other every saturday. The last thing she said, crying was ""I thought you were going to tell me that you were going through something and apologize"". She is expecting an apology, but I don't see my wrongdoing here. Am I the asshole for not apologizing?

PS: She did admit that her text was not based on anything true, she was just annoyed with me and was her way of expressing it. Even though on the phone she defended that position saying thay she meant I was going to make plans with other people.

Our son was being particularly difficult tonight (throwing tantrums during diner, before bed etc.), and we took turns to attend to him. 

Once he was in bed, I was gonna do the cleaning after diner and start a washing machine. My wife told me she was gonna need a break and wanted to watch the TV. I said sure, but before that I had to ask her something.

I told her I knew that maybe the time wasn't exactly right, but anyway my two buddy asked me as of today if I was willing to join them hiking for one day this weekend. (We had no prior plans)

My sentence wasn't even finished that she answered a hard no, saying that it was definitely not the time discussing it, that I was being selfish asking her that, and even thinking of leaving her a day alone with the kid, all that. 

I understand her needing a break and some rest, and that the time wasn't right, but I am baffled by her reaction about it (I would have accepted a no, or a demand yo discuss it some other time, but I found the way she answered me just unrespecful).

I love here and I tell her everything. She is undoubtedly my closest friend and i have stuck by her through so many hard times. My other friend (F16), we'll call her Isabelle, were friends for two years. My best friend became acquainted with Isabelle through me and I heard that they had a healthy friendship.

 During the beginning of the school year I noticed Isabelle was being more distant towards me and talking to her other friends and blowing me off a lot more. I was hanging out with her brother one day when I brought this up to him and he immediately looked uncomfortable. I pressed and hes a very blunt person so he just simply said ""Isabelle doesn't like you anymore."" I was hurt but not surprised. I asked him why and he just said that ""I talk too much""

I was even morw hurt by this. It was my next class by then and I'm quite ashamed of this but I just started sobbing. I always push myself to be a good friend and making friendships was something I struggled with for years. To hear that I had lost a friendship was extremely hard for me. Later on, I got a very long email from Isabelle, her brother had told her about how I reacted. The email was essentially a long list of everything wrong with me and why she didn't like me anymore. It was long and harsh, and talked about multiple things about myself that I couldn't change.The email had no purpose and was cruel. I struggle with mental health and insecurity, a fact that she knew about me. The email hurt me deeply and I was in a depressive episode for months and it deeply damaged my self esteem.

41,1c7fqo0,AITA for snapping and cussing at an HOA board member for not leaving us alone? ,"AITA? 

I posted this in r/amIoverreacting because I'm really not sure. This happened about a week ago and I'm on the fence. 

A month ago my husband found a largish lump on our 9 year old Russell Terrier's face. We took her to the vet who told us that there was nothing that could be done for her. I was not content with that so we got a second opinion that ended up reflecting the first. 

That vet told us that no matter how early we detected it, there was nothing we could have done short of jaw removal. She said that our pup had days maybe weeks, as it was a very aggressive cancer. She gave us a couple of prescriptions for pain and inflammation, which perked our dog up and made her playful again. When it seemed like the medicine was no longer working, we decided it was time. 

The HOA had hired a contractor to do siding replacement and painting but our back patio was a disaster so a couple days before they were going to get to our unit the HOA told my husband he needed to clean up the back patio. He spent the entirety of the day cleaning up the patio but we had made the appointment with the vet for 4:00 so he had to take a break. His plan was to finish up the little bit that still needed doing that evening. Fwiw, it took him less than 15 min to finish up that night. 

As my husband, our 10 year old, and I were all walking to the car with our dog, a woman I didn't recognize approached us. She had a smallish dog with her so I thought she was wanting to introduce our dogs to each other, which I thought was sweet. 

The first thing out of her mouth was something along the lines of her being on the board and noticing our back patio wasn't done ( which she couldn't possibly have known unless she opened our privacy fence gate). I stepped in front of my husband (who had very clearly been crying and my 10 year old who was actively crying) and told her that now was not a good time as we we're on our way to the vet to have our dog put to sleep.

I honestly can't remember how she responded exactly (the adrenaline head kicked in) but it was something along the lines of ""well the Workmen will be here tomorrow"" 

My husband said he would be finishing it and I repeated that now is really not a good time. 

She said ""well I'll have to contact someone"" and I cut her off and said ""I don't give a damn, like I said now is not a good time. We have to take our dog to go DIE, BACK OFF"" 

I sidestepped her to get to our van and said very loudly ""Jesus Christ woman, read the fucking room for fucks sake"" and we promptly left. 

I texted another HOA member who said to put the details into an email but now I'm wondering if it's worth it. I feel kind of like my language sort of relinquishes my moral high ground (I regret nothing!). Also, I can't see what recourse there would be since being a decent human being isn't a prerequisite having a board position.

42,1c7evfb,AITA for posting a photo of my neighbor's kids in a private neighborhood Facebook group?,"I live in a densely populated suburban HOA-run thing. I have like 40 houses within a 5-minute walk from mine. There is one large Facebook group for the entire community with around 4k members, and a smaller one for my part with about 180. They are both private and require proof of residence for admission. I only mention this because it is relevant to the situation.

For like a year now, there have been a group of kids using my property as their personal hangout since I am at a corner spot of 3 roads with a large area of grass and steps. While those bits are the HOA's property, everyone signs an agreement with the HOA to maintain their adjoined common area. If it was just the hangouts, I would be fine. Kids are kids and all that. However, they dump their trash, leave their toys, turn over paving stones, damage plants to the point of needing replacement, all on both my lawn and the HOA's lawn I am responsible for.

I have not said anything to anyone about about it because of the nasty attitudes towards complaints I see in those FB groups, and I do not vibe with my neighbors here enough to know most of them (whole other story.) I reached a snapping point, though, when two of the younger kids I sort of recognize from this group smashed a glass ornament on my front porch, then ding-dong-ditched. I could care less about the latter, but that glass ornament was something sentimental I'd saved from my mother's house. I tried to run out and talk to them, but they ran for the woods, so I didn't see what house they belonged to and I don't personally know their parents.

I posted a photo of them from my doorbell cam to the smaller of the FB groups, with their faces partially blurred. All I said was that I didn't expect a reply, but this has been going on for a while, and could whoever please talk to these kids and maybe inform the parents of the other kids who these two hang out with? 30 seconds later in rapid succession, I got a reply, a DM, and a knock at my door. The mother of the boys yelled at me for having posted their photo ""to the entire internet"" and went on for about 10 minutes straight without letting me get a word in edgewise. I took down the photo as asked, but I never got a chance to explain the rest of what I was hoping to achieve. She said something about how if I wanted recourse then I needed to ""be a neighbor"" and magically know who to talk to, I guess. Also she weirdly kept pushing offers to pay for what they broke, which was pointless and I refused money.

Of what I did manage to say to her, I told her that I understood her privacy concerns, but that's why I blurred their faces and kept it to that smaller group, but she still claimed it was public to the whole internet (it's not.) The other was mentioning that her own FB profile was public with photos AND names of her kids - seen from her DM.

43,1c7evak,AITA for telling my friends i regret hanging out with them,"This is a long story so i will give only an overview. I (18 f) was best friends w 4 girls from highschool. All of them studied in my hometown except me. I come back home once or twice a year. After school i noticed we were getting distant. Most plans to hangout had to be initiated and/or planned by me.

So this time i did not initiate any plans. They planned everything and it was chaotic due to some issues with getting parent's permission but was otherwise alright. But one of them ""I"" ( 17 f) was going through some issues with a boy and did not tell any of us except another friend ""MA"" (18 F). She, because she was sad and the others ignored me the whole day and continuously interrupted me. They also didn't leave any dessert for me during lunch saying they forgot to keep my share. I felt left out and horrible.

In one month of me being at my hometown we could meet only for 2 days and i was treated badly even during this time. Additionally my dad who works abroad was leaving the day after I met my friends and my grandfather was also very ill. My neighbour and close friend also had a family ememergency and i was not there for him. I sacrificed spending time with my family to be with my friends since they were not free any other day. It also hurt that during the break when i was home, 4 of them met up without telling me once and I only knew from their instagram stories.

I got interrupted and talked over too much and i pointed it out to them many times and yet they didn't stop. i got sad and told them i regreted making so many sacrifices and prioritising them over other people only for them to treat me like this and that my other friends treated me much better.

They still didn't stop. We were in ""I""'s house and she video called her other friends instead of spending time with me and i felt even worse. This was during new years eve and my entire family came to my house to celebrate as my grandfather got discharged from the hospital. I felt so sad that i left her house and went home for the night. They begged me to come back so i went back before midnight despite putting my parents through a lot of trouble. But I walked in only to find them fully drunk and spent new years taking care of them.

Later through several calls after i came back to college, they apologized and i forgave them. But they demanded that I also apologize for saying that i regretted hanging out with them. They said that just because they hurt my feelings i don't get to hurt theirs. I said that i just pointed out their mistake and if that hurt them it was their problem.

44,1c7eu3c,AITA for calling my (male) best friend’s girlfriend stupid,"Ok so I 15 (f) have been friends with Justin 15 (m) sense 8th grade, so over 2 year. That year was my first in public school so I was very nervous, but he was really nice and talked to me and brought me into his friend group.

We had lots of class together and were always with each other. Because of that dating rumors started and people were always telling us that we did not have to hide that we were “dating” we were not. I have to add he is straight and I am very openly queer. 

He and I were very uncomfortable with all that people were saying so we stopped hanging out as much for the rest of the school year. This school year we started hanging out again because it was a different school now we are in high school. We both get to school 30 minutes before it starts and the friendgroup all hangs out in the library. 

We dont have many classes together so we will meet up at free periods or in-between classes. We often bring each other snacks and stuff. At the middle of the year when justin and I were always with each other I met this girl Tina, we became friends and I introduced her to Justin.

She did think we were dating but was confused because we never held hands or hugged or kissed, so when she asked if I was dating justin I made it very clear we weren’t, and where very platonic. After like a week Justin told me he liked Tina, and she also told me she liked him.

 I convinced him to ask her out and he did. After a month of them dating. Me and justin stopped hanging out as much, but I was ok with that he was busy being with his GF. But when ever I was around him and her, she seemed to be annoyed, when he gave me some of his food Tina would glare. When we would be talking and had our feet up (He liked to annoy me by putting his feet on mine) she would start trying to get his attention on her.

 So when Justin told me that Tin was uncomfortable about how we acted with each other I stopped doing that as much. It felt weird because with my other friend group we were so much more “touchy” its a queer friend group so I thought that straight people saw things less platonic which I get. (I do stuff with my other queer friends what I would never with justin. With one of them, Sha, we are like always dancing and very flirty, as a joke because Sha is aroace and I dont like men like that.) 

But i tried to respect her boundaries, but it seemed to never be enough, one day Tina yelled at me (infront of Justin and some other friends) to stop trying to “Steal her man” I laughed at her and asked if she was stupid, that I was the one who introduced them, and helped them get together. 

Tina got really mad and now her and Justin are on a break. He is on myside that she was being rude and controlling, but some people think shes right to not want him to have any female friends. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,1.045389,1,0
45,1c7er0m,"AITA: best friend with hypochondria diagnosing me, am i an asshole for asking her to stop?","hi, i need some advice on a situation.

my best friend is a hypochondriac (constantly self-diagnosing, panicking about health, in tears about potential illnesses, almost every day says she has food poisoning or a parasite, etc).  i don't think she has awareness of her hypochondria either, and when i've tried to shed some perspective i get trampled so i stay in my own lane.  i recognize her hypochondria is likely from childhood trauma and extreme anxiety, so i give nonjudgmental support and compassion.

recently however she's turning her hypochondria towards me. i can brush this off when it's physical stuff, but lately she's convinced that I have OCD (I don't).  if i bring up anything that's bothering me she insists ""you're hyper fixating /  it's because of your OCD / you're ruminating / you have bad OCD"" etc. and it's been getting on my nerves. I've told her emphatically that my doctors have outright said I don't have this condition, no psych has ever been willing to entertain that I do, that I'm open and honest with my docs and would have no problem being diagnosed with it, but I don't meet the criteria over and over. it's annoying to have to defend myself to my best friend, honestly, wtf. but i try to move along and not let it get to me, recognizing that she's a hypochondriac and not to give it too much air time.

well, two weeks ago i told her i was feeling guilty about an incident at work that week where i'd gotten into trouble for breaking a rule (first time i told her about it) and she immediately fires back with ""you're obsessing and hyper ruminating, it's because of your OCD etc etc""... I realize she isn't even listening to me or what I'm saying and is just going off again with this response.

So at this point I kindly to please stop calling me OCD, I don't have that condition, my psych team has never thought so even when I directly asked about this specific condition, and let's please leave that kind of decision-making to doctors, you and I aren't doctors, etc.  

  
Well my friend hasn't spoken to me since i asked her to stop diagnosing me.  it's been 10 days and i haven't heard anything from her, she stopped texting me (we text daily usually) sending me funny things on instagram, literally vanished.  i feel like i'm being punished for standing up for myself with a healthy boundary, and it hurts.  i didn't even think it was that big of a deal.

  
am i an asshole for asking her not to pathologize me?  honestly it feels kinda like she's the asshole for taking so much offense to a simple boundary... idk. i miss my friend and feel bit in the ass by her hypochondria that i tolerate so patiently... don't think she has any clue how hard it is to be around.

TLDR; best friend with hypochondria diagnosing me with things i don't have, stopped talking to me when i asked her to stop, and now i feel like the asshole for asserting a healthy boundary

46,1c7elrh,AITA for avoiding confrontation with my best friends during an internship,"Hello, people of Reddit, I need some perspective on a situation with my friends, Sarah, Ashe, and Ruth. We've been close since college started, but recently, things have gotten tense.

We're interning at a hotel, and one day, while waiting for the bus with Sarah and Ashe (Ruth was out sick), they seemed distant, avoiding me. They even chose seats far away on the bus, which was odd since we always sat together.

As the internship continued, tensions grew. Sarah and Ashe kept me at a distance, even inviting someone else to sit with them, excluding me. I felt hurt and confused. The next day, Ruth returned, and I confided in her. I told her how I felt excluded and uncomfortable, but told her I didn't want to confront Sarah and Ashe directly during the internship.

Later, I discovered Ruth talked to Sarah and Ashe without my consent. Things seemed to improve, but then Sarah and Ashe accused me of talking behind their backs, making derogatory remarks about Ashe's financial situation. When I tried to talk to Sarah, she brushed me off and insulted me.

After hearing all of this I was lost, I never said anything about Ashes financial problems to anyone, there's no reason to even talk about it. Ruth denies saying anything regarding so and said she just wanted to clear up misunderstandings because I asked her to. But she later called me an A-hole for ""lying"" and causing a rift between her and the others.

TLDR: I confided in Ruth about feeling excluded by Sarah and Ashe during our internship instead of addressing it directly with them. Ruth intervened without my consent, leading to accusations of me talking behind their backs. Could my indirect approach and Ruth's involvement make me the ""asshole"" in this situation?

48,1c7e9is,AITA for telling my friend I didn't have a good time at a party she threw for me?,"

About a week and a half ago, Perry put a small group chat together with her, Jake(her bf) and a mutual friend jerri. We decided to go to a Karaoke bar I frequent as I'm leaving for the army soon and she wanted to celebrate my leaving. Of course I abliged, I love Karaoke and wanted to have one more good time together before I left and there weren't many people so the social anxiety wouldn't act up. It was all planned out since Monday last week, just us 4 and me as the DD 

Come Friday, Perry said she double booked Saturday and changed it to Friday. This was very last minute but we agreed. Then Perry decided to bring 2 more of her friends along with her brother Trevor and had her friends drive instead of me. Jerri said the ""more the merrier"" and jack said ""sure, I don't see why not."" I was clearly out numbered in the opinion so I just went with it.

Fast forward to when I was picked up (cause the decided as I was leaving to pick them up that I wasn't DDing.) As soon as I got in the car I could tell Perry was already drunk and high along with her friend she asked to come last minute. I met Jack for the first time. Then the entire ride, I spoke to her brother who only came out to hang out with me. The entire ride, Perry and her friends were talking to themselves and not even looking at me.

We get to the place 2 hours late and get a table that's too small. I told them there were 8 people so we should move to a table with more room. I was ignored and moved out of the way. Trevor and I move to the area I said we should move to. We sat there all night with people coming over to talk to us a couple times for only a couple minutes. The rest of the time I was there Perry and them were crammed in a corner talking away and having a blast while I was in an empty room with Trevor. By the end of the night they had all moved over to my table and forced me and Trevor out because Perry had invited even more people to sit with them so they couldn't fit. 

Finally we get to the big issue. After that long and stressful night, I expressed in the group chat calmly that I didn't really have a good time and it was way more stressful than fun. I explained that they barely spoke to me at my own party and that I barely knew anyone that was there, and the people I knew the least were the ones actually talking to me other than Trevor, and even then, the conversations were only a couple minutes long. I was then messaged by Jerri and her husband and told that my feelings were valid and that I'm still young and learning, but I should have tried a little harder to include myself. I told them they were right, but I did do that at the beginning explaining that I told them we couldn't all fit at the table they picked and we should have moved. Perry then decided to blow up on me calling me a selfish asshole and said no one should cater to me as I'm an adult and should socialize myself.

49,1c7e700,"AITA for not wanting to care for my elderly, Alzheimer’s diagnosed parent?","My mother (63) was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and has moved in with me (35), my husband (40), and our daughter (4). 

My mom and I have not had the closest relationship throughout my life, I was closer to my dad (who passed when I was a teen) and my younger sister (who now lives overseas) was always closer to my mom. When my sister was born, and continuing on even now in adult life, my mom has been wrapped around my sisters finger. My whole family has acknowledged it, even when we were kids. My mom has always babied her and been closer to her than with me. There have been specific instances I always remember in my life where my mom flat out cast me aside in favor of my sister (even on the day I got engaged). 

I’ve had resentment towards her this whole time, always keeping my distance so I don’t get hurt again. Now that she was diagnosed and could not live alone, her only option outside of a living facility was to live with me. At first I thought it harmless but as time goes on, it has been increasingly affecting my mental health. She is mostly clear headed but has moments where she isn’t and it’s hard to tell if the way she is behaving is part of her past patterns or because of the disease. It drives me insane and brings up feelings from past trauma all the time. 

My anger and resentment has only continued to grow and I’m at the point where I don’t want to care for her anymore. My husband and I were going to try for another baby right before we had to take my mom in, and now the stress is so high, I cannot imagine having another baby while also caring for my mom. 

 I feel like I got the crap end of the stick because my sister lives overseas living out her dreams and I am the only family to care for mom, putting my life on hold to do so. 

I feel like an asshole because, typically, if you are able, you take care of your parents in old age, and I absolutely do not want to anymore.

On surface level, I could definitely be an asshole, but with our rocky relationship that stems from childhood, I’m not sure that I am. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,0.0059546847,0,1

51,1c7e297,AITA smoking weed after mates wedding reception,"I was the best man at my mate's wedding. We've been best friends since school, and I was stoked to support him however I could. I flew from overseas 10 days early, helping with decorations, venue setup, flower runs, etc. It was a full-on week, but I was proud to be there for him.

The wedding day was perfect. By the end of the night it was just me (23), my gf (24) his sister(22) and her friend (24) left chatting at a table. We all headed back to our room at 1.30am to hang out and my gf said she was going out to smoke a joint if anyone wanted to join.

The sister said she had smoked before and wanted to come out with us. I took a small hit to unwind after being up from 7am and from worrying about my speech all morning lol (it went well actually). Anyways the sister took about 6 hits. I didn't think much of it, assuming she knew what she was doing, but when we went back to the room she started panicking a bit from being too high, so we calmed her down, gave her water/snacks and made sure she was okay until she was good to go to bed. I've been there before and it wasn't a big deal once I sobered up so I didn't really worry about it.

But after the honeymoon (which I payed for as a wedding present and was super excited to hear all about) my mate calls, absolutely furious, claiming I ruined his wedding. His sister had 'confessed' to the whole family about getting high (remeber she's 6mo younger than me), and he (/the whole fam?) blamed me for it. He was upset we broke the law (he's smoked with me before?). I live in Canada in an area where it's very normalised (and legal) so I worry I've become too desensitised to the cultural difference with the UK since I've been here for 5ish yrs now, but to my knowledge a lot of young people smoke in the UK too?

  
He accused me of not wanting to be present (i.e because I was high) for the most important day of his life. I said that was a bit of mischaracterisation given that I had spent 10 days on call ready to help with everything, and was 100% sober until 1.30am when all the guests were gone and then only had 1 hit. Apparently he'd also given the hotel my number for emergencies and hadn't told me. If I knew I wouldn't have smoked at all, but as it was I still didn't have any alcohol and not enough weed to feel impaired on the off chance something needed my attention.

52,1c7dqhn,WIBTA If I (26F) don't have my sister (21F) be a bridesmaid?,"My sister is getting married in May. We always talked about having each other as MOH since we are each other's only sister (we have an older brother). When she got engaged, she did not have me as her MOH, instead having my SIL. I'm not going to lie, it really hurt my feelings and I tried to accept it. She changed her mind a month later due to my parents throwing a fit and now we are co-MOH's.

Then I had to plan the bachelorette. I was planning it based off of what she was texting me she wanted; however, my SIL and sister's future SILs fought me on every choice i made, claiming that she wanted the polar opposite and when we all tried talking to her about it, she got mad we couldn't resolve it on our own.

Then the bachelorette. I flew across the country to attend. Everyone completely ignored me at the bachelorette, none of the decor I purchased was used and the SILs took credit for the things I had done for the trip. The first night, I went to tell my sis and other girls in the hot tub to turn the volume down to avoid a $500 noise violation fine from the Airbnb and my sister says ""Ignore her, she's a b\*\*\*\*."" which hurt a lot because I put a lot of effort into the trip. The next day, I offered to do a coffee run while they were at the first bar because I didn't feel like drinking yet and needed a coffee. In the 10 minutes I was gone, they took the one and only group picture from the trip without me.

I also found out that day that it was my sister who told my parents I was bisexual last year without my permission. I never wanted them to know since they don't agree with homosexuality. When I said how upset I was, she went ""You probably snitched on me for something and deserved it"".

After the bachelorette, I was incredibly upset and when I tried talking to her about it, she only apologized by saying ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" and tried to defend her actions but never actually said she was sorry for hurting me. I have barely heard from her since. I also found out recently all the bridesmaids are getting their nails done together for the wedding and I was not told. When I talked to my sis about it she went ""Well I didn't know when you are flying back"" which she very easily could have texted me to ask.

Now for the part where I'm debating if I will be an asshole. I know I'm getting engaged in the very near future (next month I think!). Now, I don't even want her in the bridal party at all. She has been mean to our entire family in her wedding planning process, and she has not made an effort to contribute to a relationship with me in the last few years. She doesn't even know what state I live in even though I've lived here for years. Would I be the asshole if I don't have her be a bridesmaid in my bridal party once I get engaged?

For a little backstory, there was a boy I liked for maybe a year, it was just a crush and I never actually talked to him. I decided like 2 months ago that I’d just try to get over the crush I had on him because not having a chance with him was seriously affecting me

Recently I found something out relating to the boy that made me think “Maybe he actually did like me at SOME POINT” so of course I go and I tell my best friend who would then agree that he could have maybe liked me at one point.

Take back to 3 weeks ago, I’m at lunch and my best friend tells the group we sit with at lunch about what I told her. This causes them all to start laughing at me and saying things like “he doesn’t like you” or “you scare him” or “he thinks you’re weird just leave him alone.” Usually, I don’t mind jokes and even laugh but this time I really felt like they were making fun of me and trying to embarrass me so I told them, “I’m not talking to y’all anymore.” I then would hear my friend say I’m upset because he didn’t like me and because they were telling the truth, but I was already done with the crush before bringing up what I found.

So now it’s been 2-3 weeks and I still haven’t talked to any of them. My friend even blocked me. My friend asked me why I was upset but she said it in a joking type of way that didn’t feel genuine so I didn’t tell her. EDIT: To add I’ve always had trouble communicating my feelings in the right way so that probably added onto why I didn’t respond.

He drinks everyday around 8-10 beers and if there’s no beers left, he’ll drink whatever is available. Most nights he’s so drunk and can’t even speak clearly.
I drop subtle hints that I think he doesn’t need another but he doesn’t get the hint unless I flat out say stop drinking.
This always leads to an argument about how he and everyone else (ie me) are having fun and I always have to ruin it. I tell him it’s never fun for me to be around someone who’s always drunk. He ends up ignoring me for the rest of the night but I hear him mutter under his breath that I ruin all his fun and just say things to start an argument.
So I’m wondering, AITA for telling him to stop drinking all the time?


Edit:
Just to clarify, he hasn’t been an alcoholic all 4 years. It started last year and we did nearly split up when it all started. He took it too far one night and the next morning was on the phone to his doctors and the AA. Unfortunately, and probably sums up the NHS at the moment, they told him he didn’t have a problem and he could probably sort it out on his own. To him this meant he was fine so nothings changed.
His mom and myself have sat him down while sober to talk about it and he just gets defensive and walks away. I try talking to him the morning after and I get a sorry but nothing changes. The reason for me asking him to stop drinking on the night, is because he ends up keeping me up all night and on a work night, it’s annoying.
This is why I question if I’m the A-hole because I’m wanting a night of sobriety for my benefit and his health but am I ruining his fun.

2nd edit:
Lots of people are asking about what may be the reason for him to start drinking so much. I’m sure there’s more to it but the increase in alcohol came when he tried to quit smoking. He compensated and since then he’s back to smoking but hasn’t eased up on the alcohol. 
He has a job as a tradesman where the standard is stopping at the pub before coming home.
We don’t have kids and I own the house we live in. I could kick him out but I think it would send him on a bigger spiral. I know people may say it’s not my responsibility, however I can’t help but feel it would be my fault if it got any worse because I sent him packing.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,1.0222645,1,0

They offered me a job working as a cashier and doing to go order for $11 an hour. When I first started I told them that there was one day a week I couldn’t work because of club meetings. everything was going well till they started scheduling me that specific day every week and begging me to come in. After a while I simply would just say no and not reply to their begs. 

There’s specific days I have asked to take off due to test. They would constantly text me begging me to come in on my off days. Normally I would not have a problem if the reason was not because their own daughter needed someone to cover for her. Mind you I live half an hour and only get scheduled for 5 hours shifts so I’m paying more for gas than I am making.

My mom recently got surgery and hasn’t been able to drive. this particular Saturday I had to take her to her doctors appointment. I work Monday-friday but just in case I told them that I was not available. Early Monday I told them and then everyday after that they would text me if I could come in. And on Wednesday they came to talk to me during work asking me again. I told them no because I had to drive my mom. At the end of the week I told my mom they kept harassing me and she confessed that it was because their daughter that normally works on Saturday’s had a party to go to and they wanted me to cover for her. 

I had lunch scheduled the next day with their daughter. I told her how I was going to quit because I just didn’t have time to be available every time they wanted. Also that leaving me alone to run the restaurant when the servers don’t want to do their job isn’t fair to me because in the end I don’t get the tip. She said I was a Asshole if I went through with it after her parents gave me a job even with no prior experience. Also that I couldn’t just ignore her parents text when I didn’t want to work because in the end they were my bosses. she is right it was my first job and I understand why I’m not entitled to a bigger pay. It’s also not bad in terms of money so now I just feel like a asshole for ghosting them. Also this could potentially ruin their friendship with my parents.

58,1c7cyx1,WIBTA if i leave my friend's wedding early to go to a music festival?,"A long time friend of mine has invited me to attend a wedding in a very nice European location (we live in the U.S.). 

Since the wedding festivities will span only a few days (an excursion the day prior, the  day of the wedding, then a farewell brunch the last day), I am extending the trip and having other friends join me after to make the most of such an expensive flight to Europe.

It turns out, on the day of wedding, one of my all time favorite artists will be playing in a nearby city. It is my absolute dream to see them play in this city, I have been thinking about it for years wondering how and when such an opportunity might come up. Somehow, it magically came up and I will be a 2 hour train ride away!

WIBTA if I leave the wedding early (I would be able to stay for the ceremony and pre-reception drinks, but I'd miss the party after) if I took off and joined my other friends for the show?

If it matters: we have been friends for close to 15 years. We don't live in the same city or share a hometown, so its very rare we see one another but over the years we have managed to catch each other every couple of years, save for 2020-21. We speak once a year aside from some texting, and i historically make the effort for the calls (have made less effort recently, which means less communication). That said, I would still consider her one of my oldest and closest friends, and I'd say she does too. We have the type of relationship that picks right back up wherever we left off. Because of this, I figured the best thing to do is to just be at the wedding because I do care about sustaining this friendship long term. I don't want to hurt her, either.

Then the other part of me thinks - wait. I am spending $1.5K+ to be at the bachelorette, then $2K+ just to attend her wedding. I am forgoing a trip to see my family and a few other things to be at these events, both in terms of my finances and how much time I can take off work. Some part of me feels entitled to do what I want with my time. Her investment in our friendship is light, but at this point I think I have made it so my investment is equal. 

I haven't talked to her about it - I'm afraid just bringing it up will be offensive. What do yall think, WIBTA?",Asshole,2024-04-18,1.0,1.0365645,1,1

The last few months or so I have started realising I'm not happy in the relationship, a lot of the effort seems one sided.  
  
Whenever I have tried to talk to my partner about it she gets defensive instead of actually listening to what I am trying to say or will just dismiss what I've said and act like there's nothing wrong. I have tried multiple times over the last few months to talk about how I'm feeling and concerns I have and have been shut down every time.  
  
After being dismissed yet again I told her we needed to talk. I told her I wasn't happy in the relationship and that I think it's best if we break up. She asked what had brought it on and I pointed out the repeated dismissals of my concerns and she denied it happened but I told her it's best if we end things.  
  
I do still love her and wish her the best and everything but I don't want to be in a relationship with her. The issue came when we started discussing living arrangements. I have no family or friends nearby that I could stay with and we have 8 months left on the lease.  
  
We both transfer half of the rent to our landlord each month. All the bills are in my name. The cost to end the lease early is 6 months rent or the remainder of the lease, whichever is smaller but we wouldn't have that much money to just pay in a lump sum.  
  
I told my gf I was happy to take the couch for now and then look at getting a little bed for the spare room since the apartment is both of our homes. She said she'd probably just move back home with her parents but then said she would not be paying the rent and bills when she moves out.  
  
I told her while she might not be living here she's still on the lease so she still has to pay her half of the rent until we can find a roommate to move in after she's moved out.  
  
I said I'd pay all of the utilities but I can't afford the full place on my own. She said she's not going to be paying for somewhere she doesn't live but I tried explaining that she's still on the lease for the apartment so until we find a roommate for the spare room she should be paying her half.

60,1c7bz8h,AITA For refusing to continue caring for my friends kittens after she told me they weren't fixed?,"So I (19M) Recently moved into a farmhouse with my roommate (19M) but before I originally moved in, I got a text from one of my best friends (21F) asking me if I could take in her kitten, because one of her roommates was acting strange about her. She was a small kitten barely making it to her teens and she had little thumbs on her front paws. I had met the kitten before and agreed, not wanting anything bad to happen to my friend or her kitten.
The day before I was planning on picking the kitten up, my BFF texted me if I could actually take BOTH her cats (another girl cat but a little older) I was hesitant but felt pressured to agree since she told me if I couldn't take them shed have to re-home them, and I knew how attached she was to the cats. A couple weeks in me and my roommate noticed that the two were a troublesome pair, neither were well trained but we expected this, they were kittens after all. What we didn't expect is that even though they were kittens they didn't have a lot of proper training for one teen cat and one preteen. The little one would poop in the litter box but would pee wherever she liked, the bigger one went specifically for my roommates paint water instead of just her regular water. While it didn't bother me as much it bothered my roommate quite a bit, and he asked if I could get an update on when the cats would be returned. I asked her and she told me she would come take at least one car within the month, we were satisfied.
Then we noticed the older cat acting strange, I had seen cats in heat before and noticed her behavior matched the signs of early heat. I asked my BFF if she had them fixed, she said no. Keep in mind I live in a farmhouse on farmland, and some of the farmers will come in(they're family friends I've known most my life) to use our toilet or eat lunch. If one of these unfixed cats were to go out into the wild, they'd likely meet the big population of wild tomcats in the area, not to mention we agreed to take in kittens (really one kitten) not two unfixed cats. I apologized but said that I really couldn't in good conscience make my roommate suffer or risk these cats getting pregnant, and that I didn't sign up for a cat in heat. She got really angry about it, she didn't yell or scream but she made sure I knew she was not happy, I tried to find a solution that would help us both, like her taking one of the cats and we take the other, or maybe her taking the cat to get it fixed and we'd keep homing them, but she was adamant that she come get the cats after this little fight, I said fine, and she got her cats back.
Now something I haven't mentioned before, is that their previous home life wasn't great, they lived in a basement in the middle of the city with a lot of roommates and a lot of other cats. I had had these cats for a month and their personalities changed a lot once they got comfortable, so after a week I texted my friend on Snapchat to see how they were doing.

61,1c7bxr8,AITA for getting mad at my friend for not taking care of the apartment he rents from my family,"Reposting because I didnt include why I have any stake in the apartment not being taken care of. Some parts are edited to fit the word limit.

I’ve recently had a blow out with my best friend of around 10 years. There has been a lot of stuff building up, but it was the last straw when he told me it wasn’t my place to tell him how to live since I’m not his landlord after I’d given him shit a couple of times when it was so messy there wasn’t even a place to sit down. This isn’t true since I help manage the property by cleaning the apartments after tenants move out and doing the odd maintenance jobs here and there. The building is owned by my mom and her siblings and we got it from my grandpa after he died.

Even though it’s not the nicest place, his rent is heavily reduced(as a favor for a friend). He’s been living there around 3 years and only in the last 2 or so months has the place been semi-clean, and only because his girlfriend told him to clean it. Before she moved in, the house was comparable to a semi-clean frat house(sticky floors, mold in the showers and under the sink, smoking inside, etc.).

I never once complained for the first 2 years since he should be able to live how he wants. The only time I asked him to do something was when his friend crashed drunk into the garage causing minor damage that could be relatively fixed with a little paint. I asked him repeatedly and told him why it was important to me, but it still took over a year to fix it. It is especially frustrating since for 2-3 months of that year he wasn’t working AT ALL.

I’ve brought up multiple times how much the apartment means to me since I grew up fixing the place with my grandfather, who was the closest I’ve had to a father figure, but it did not make a difference.

Now that the house is cleaner, he is angry that I am still upset. He believes that since the place is semi-clean I should “get over it.” While I appreciate that the place is cleaner, he then brought in his girlfriend’s dog, who is not house trained. Before moving the dog in, he never asked permission from my mom or anyone else. 

Also, he ended up letting so much mold build up under the sink that we had to sand it down since my immediate family are the property managers and do a lot of the work ourselves.

I feel obliged to mention that over the past 2 years I’ve been colder and incredibly snippy(almost insulting) about most things he says, which has caused him to also not want to hang out with me(which I understand completely). While I could have been more direct, I wasn’t sure how to bring it up without getting angry since I the place means so much to me.

Also, his dad helped me get my first job after college, but the work environment is incredibly hostile and I’m essentially his dad’s whipping boy(meaning I run errands for him that are completely unrelated to my job).

Also, I don’t treat any of the other tenants this way since he is paying half of what we usually charge and was a close friend.",Asshole,2024-04-18,1.0,0.9864399,1,1

The bus lady doesn’t always let me on early mostly because it’s illegal but I had no idea it was until she told me today if that sounds unbelievable I’m sorry but it’s just what happened maybe I’m just stupid but I digress, for whatever reason she left the bus on for some reason. So I was just standing at the door breathing in the gas fumes, when she opened the door I asked her if she could please not leave the bus on while I was waiting outside. I have no idea what prompted what she said next maybe I said it in a nasty way because I was in a bad mood and I sometimes have tonal problems, but she grabbed my arm and told me she wasn’t going to be nice anymore if i was going to be a smart alack, and she also told me she couldn’t let me on early because it’s illegal. I tried to explain to her that I had no idea, and that the school let me out early because of my sensory issues and she simply said “well that’s the school’s issue not mine!” And she also said “well you didn’t have to stand so close to the bus!

63,1c7bcw1,AITA for wanting to get rid of my curfew as a 20 year old student?,"I(20f)live at home as I am getting my bachelor’s degree and teaching license(my parents and I splitting the cost). I work at a preschool as much as it’s open and pay for my food, gas, fees, etc. My dad has always been strict about my curfews and as of right now I am allowed to have my boyfriend(20)of almost 3 years, over until midnight Sun-Thurs and 1 am Fri-Saturday. By curfew, I mean both when I have to be home and when my boyfriend needs to leave our house. I have always been an honor roll student, never snuck out or snuck anyone in, always follow curfews even though they’re bullshit- because what other option do I have? Current curfews reflect that of a high schooler(should’ve seen my high school curfew)and I don’t know what else I could do to convince him that this is unreasonable, as I’m doing everything right that I possibly could at my age. People are getting married, pregnant, partying at my age and after a long night of doing homework I have to roll over and tell my boyfriend goodbye. My dads reasoning is that he wants the house “shut down” and has literally said that he just wants to be able to walk around his own house with his shirt off. I don’t find this to be a reason to draw lines over my life. We are not loud, going in and out, or disrespectful- we quite literally do homework or watch tv. My parents were engaged after 5 months of knowing each other- and I am expected to send my bf home like a middle schooler when spending genuine time with him is what allows me to keep going each day. There is no reason to push your children away for such a selfish reason, especially in this economy, so if I end up moving out and coming back asking for money like his other kids, that’ll be on him.

This is the text I got last night after an extremely long day and I mistakenly asked for more time- “This is turning in to a regular occurrence. Don't ask again for a long while. This has nothing to do with how old you are or with ____ personally. It has everything to do with just wanting our house to US after a certain decent hour. I don't find that unreasonable or anything I need to keep explaining. It's not that complex. We can talk about a later time on weekends.”

I am so frustrated because I work extremely hard and still can’t get what I ask for. At 20 years old in downtown Columbus, my dad would have thrown a fucking fit if anyone even insinuated forcing this rule onto him. We are both very opinionated and I don’t think I have any shot at getting through to him so I need y’all to be honest.

EDIT: This is my DADS RULE, not my moms. My moms career majorly pays for everything in my household, so I don’t feel that his rules are the ones I should have to abide by. Multiple people have also asked if I can go to my boyfriends house, but that’s not allowed either. The point is that it’s not about “my house my rules”, its about controlling me. My brother is YOUNGER(16) and is constantly let slip(dad has even joked TO US about my brother’s girlfriend being over past their curfew).",Asshole,2024-04-18,1.0,0.9886858,1,1

I’m going to uni in September as a mature student and met a group of 4 other mature students (EDIT: mature student is the UK term for students over 22 🫡) also looking for housing. 3 of them seem really chill and we really get on, but 1 of the girls hasn’t really put any effort in.. hasn’t looked at houses, barely replies to messages unless it’s a “hey please reply to this what’s everybody’s budget” kind of thing. 

When I sent houses through she just said she needs to have a garden and didn’t give any more details. 

The whole thing just throws me off and my intuition says she’ll run just before we move in and leave us in a situ where we can’t afford her portion of rent, or that she’ll be difficult to live with. 

At least 1 of the others feels the same and I haven’t spoken to the other 2 about it.

66,1c7b8mk,AITA for not responding to my ex-best friends after they attempted to reach out?,"I (21F) became best friends with two people during my freshman year of college and we were instantly close. We ended up moving in together during our sophomore year. All seemed to be going well, at least to me! We made it through sophomore year and then moved into together again during Junior year. Once again, I thought things were going well. As the final quarter started to come up, I kept bringing up housing. I brought it up twice specifically that I remember, saying “So we are just gonna live together again next year, right?” To no response and shrugs. I didn’t think much of it at that point because if there was some issue I needed to know about, that would have been the time to bring it up.   
Fast forward to my first day of classes. I got dressed up and came home after 8 hours of class. I took my outfit off, changed into my pajamas, took an edible and curled up on the couch under a blanket. My friend came up to me and had a very strange energy. And they said “We decided that we are gonna live together, without you next year.” This took me WILDLY by surprise. Not once had they brought up anything within our living situation that bothered them. They had continued talking but I couldn’t hear it and I was so focused on not bursting into tears, that I just kept saying, yup, mmhmm. I ran to my room, threw my shoes on and ran outside while bawling. IT was so out of left field.   
Fast forward, I’m in class ranting outwardly about what they had done and a girl I wasn’t friends with on the other side of the room said, “You are roommates with Tina, right?” (Tina is not her name, FYI). She goes on to tell me that TIna had been talking shit about me since FRESHMAN YEAR and that she used to tell her (since we were in the same major) to avoid me at all costs. I have always had a very hard time making friends so knowing that one of the people I trusted the most was actively working against me, I couldn’t fathom it. There are many other instances that I can elaborate on, but for sake of brevity, I won’t here.   
I moved out of that house, separated from them, and moved in with a close family friend and my life instantly turned around. After a couple months, I couldn’t imagine going back to the way I was living before.

  
Maybe a week or so ago, Tina texted me. She said that she missed me and that she and my other ex-friend would love to go out with me sometime to catch up. This was, again, wildly out of left field. We chatted back and forth extremely briefly, but I never ended up responding to the message asking to hang. Part of me really doesn’t care, like at all. You fucked me over, were immature, and actively tried to make my life worse. But another much more mature part of me knows that I should extend an olive branch and be an adult and give them the benefit of the doubt. 

  
Am I the asshole if I just never respond? Do I owe them a response?

We had around a month to do it which is 40% our OVERALL grade ( mind you this project is based on PROJECT MANAGEMENT ) . It’s supposed to be a group of 5 , 3 pp going no contact 

So two weeks ago Michael and I bought this to the professors attention explaining our situation. He asked us to send a few more message into our teams chat to confirm there has been no contact . 

28th March : Michael and I got started on making a project plan for what each of us has to do. However we made our own deadlines , mine was to finish all my section by the 12th ( I’m getting surgery and would like to leave a few days for recovery ) and Michael the 15 ( he has a presentation to do in Dubai ) 


10th April : Leo decided to join after our last warning email about he will be getting 0 for no participation or communication. Since I was nearly done mine and Michael his , we gave him an extra part and asked him to put all the files ( ~10) into one pdf document to submit . Since he’s the only one available after we’re gone ( it includes excel and words so it would take some time to put it together nicely + commentary ) 

16th April 18:00: 4th member Thomas texted in he can get rest if the tasks done. We already have everything done apart from putting it all together , so I just ignored him 

17th : I texted into the group reminding them that it’s due tomorrow, if they could please start putting it together.  Also that I’m sorry but I’m still in recovery and is in a lot of pain.
Was a bit worried since there was no reply to this , but thought surely they would have some decency.

18th 10:30 : I’m panicking and having a massive breakdown because it is not done and still in 10 different files . Tried texting in group, even tried ringing them . No answer.

Had to take all my painkillers to kill the pain, however codeine hits me really hard and I struggle to stay awake . I basically just had to screenshot diagrams and do minimum commentary . Eventually submitted at 12:50 ( due at 1pm)

Along that time I texted in the group asking for signatures and student numbers blah blah which only got one 

15:00 Thomas decided to send in his student number and signatures ( ignored )

And now Leo is complaining about how we should resubmit because he didn’t add in any commentaries or how I’m missing some graphs from his work . That since it’s only been a few hours there shouldn’t be much penalties. 


I emailed the professor about this situation ( I am not happy to resubmit ) and has gotten no reply yet . 

I feel like maybe I should’ve kept my temper under check and communicated properly , but I was just so so mad and upset I couldn’t . I feel bad I didn’t even check with them on the final draft and missed out some graphs but we all had our own tasks.

73,1c79dnr,AITA For Not Wanting My Friend to Ride With Me?,"I have a friend-Show Friend (SF)- who puts on ticketed events every few months in the evening, and a friend I go to market with-Market Friend (MF)-weekly in the morning. They're in opposite directions with me in the middle. I invited MF to one of SF's events, we met at the venue, and MF and I bought tickets to the next one, which is this weekend. It's the same day I meet up with MF in the mornings, and I told MF when we bought tickets that my plan was to see them at market, come home and take a good long nap before SF's event, and meet them at the venue like last time. It wasn't until today that MF said they wanted to drive only as far as my house, get ready and pregame there, and go for food before SF's event, with me driving from my house. 

I don't *want* to spend the whole day with MF, which is what their plan would amount to considering drive times, and need time to myself between activities, as well as not be responsible for additional activities/driving responsibilities they planned without my input, which I explained in much more diplomatic terms. They also left earlier than I did last time, and as I don't get as much time with SF, I like to linger and hang out a bit after the show. MF then complained that they had farther to drive home after, and didn't like doing so in the rain last time (weather's clear this weekend) and I should be willing as a friend to do at least part of the driving since we're going to the same place anyway. I reminded MF that I was already doing extra driving to see them in the morning, and they knew how far away the event was and what my plans for it were when we bought tickets. 

We haven't spoken since, and I still plan on going to the morning activity because I enjoy it. But I know that if I give in to MF's whining about the distance and let them ride with me from my place, I'm going to be tired, cranky and resentful all night, so I refuse.

74,1c798pc,WIBTA For Not Letting My Ex-Friend Use My Things,"Hi so my friend, we’ll call him David (now no longer friends) and I recently got into a small argument, and he sent me a bunch of messages mentioning all of my faults and no longer wanting to be friends. I told him I would like to fix this as we were such close friends for a while with no avail; it was odd that he wanted to end the relationship over something so small. I respectfully responded and wished him good luck in the future. 

Now, since we are dorming in the same college suite, things have become complicated. He gave me pots and pans as a gift a while ago that we have both used since we were friends, but now that we aren’t, I don’t want to let him use them. I also put my tv on top of two large bins that are mine, where he puts his clothes into. 

All of the people living in our college suite are friends, so I wouldn’t want to disrupt or cause any tensions. But at the same time, I really would dislike having him using my belongings.

TLDR: WIBTA if I told my ex-friend that I didn’t feel comfortable with him using my things and putting his clothes in my bins? Even though he had given me those pots and pans, but they are technically mine. And although I don’t use the contents within the bins as they are solely as a stand to hold the TV, would it be wrong of me to tell him I didn’t want him to put his clothes inside? I’m afraid I would be petty, but I am not sure. Anything would be appreciated. Thank you.",Asshole,2024-04-18,1.0,0.0043491954,0,0
75,1c794yr,AITA for getting angry at my friend for not taking care of his apartment?,"I’ve[25M] recently had a blow out with my best friend[25M] of around 10 years. There has been a lot of stuff building up, but it was the last straw when he told me it wasn’t my place to tell him how to live since I’m not his landlord. Even though it’s not the nicest place, his rent is heavily reduced and is mainly paid for by his dad. He’s been living there around 3 years now and only in the last 2 or so months has the place been semi-clean, and this is only because his girlfriend moved in and told him to clean it. Before she moved in, the house was comparable to a semi-clean frat house(sticky floors, mold in the showers and under the sink, smoking inside, etc.).

I never once complained for the first 2 years since we are in our 20s, and he should be able to live how he wants. The only time I asked him to do something was when his friend crashed into the garage causing very minor damage that could be fixed with a little paint. I asked him repeatedly and told him why it was important to me, but it still took over a year to fix it. It is especially frustrating since for 2-3 months of that year he wasn’t working AT ALL, and we live in a city where you could drive 10 minutes or less to pick some up.

I’ve brought up multiple times how much the apartment means to me since I grew up cleaning and fixing the place with my grandfather, who was the closest I’ve had to a father figure, but it did not make a difference. Rather than get angry about it, I decided to just give him shit about not keeping the place clean since that’s what some of my other friends were doing.
 
Now that the house is cleaner, he is angry that I am still upset. He believes that since the place is now semi-clean and I am not the landlord that I should “get over it.” While I appreciate that the place is cleaner, he also brought in his girlfriend’s dog, who is a stray and not house trained. Before moving the dog in, he never asked permission from my mom or anything. Also, he ended up letting so much mold build up under the sink that my stepdad had to sand it down since him and my mom are essentially the property managers and do a lot of the work themselves. Other than the sink he hasn’t caused any significant damage.

I feel obliged to mention that over the past 2 years I’ve become a lot colder and incredibly snippy(almost insulting) about most things he says, which has caused him to also not want to hang out with me(which I understand completely). While I could have been more direct, I wasn’t sure how to bring it up without getting angry since I have already sat him down and told him how much the place means to me.

Also, his dad got me a job working as a legal assistant, but the work place is incredibly hostile and I get paid about 7 dollars over minimum wage for the city I live in.

It's the sequence to my absolute favorite game and I've been really looking forward to it. Now, I realize that 100GB is a great deal of data. I realize that it'll consume a lot of space and bandwidth and internet data, so before downloading it, I talked to my mom about it. I offered to buy an additional 100GB internet package with my own money specifically for the game. She told me not to do that, and told me to wait until the last day of the month (we renew our internet data on the 19th of every month, so the ""last day"" would be the 18th of the month) and download it. I agreed with her that I'd download it after she's done working since she works from home online. After she was done working, I told her that I'll start downloading it and she told me to wait until night (it was already 7pm at that point), and when I told her I didn't want to do that since the internet subscription is going to end at exactly 12 am and the game is likely going to take days to download as is, she started arguing with me and telling me ""it's not fair for me to consume all the data"" and ""everyone else deserves to enjoy the internet too"" and ""she won't be able to work tomorrow like that"". I understand that it's not fair for one person out of a 4 member family to consume 100GB of data, but that's exactly why I offered to buy my own data. I also have absolutely no problem pausing the download while she's working, of course I'm not going to slow down her work when she's working hard to make money for the family. My issue is that this is what we agreed to, and I've been waiting for this day for a month now and literally counting the days until I can download the game. I told her upfront how much data the game was going to consume and was completely transparent with her, and we agreed that I would download it once she's done working, and now she turns around and implies that I'm being selfish for wanting to follow through with our agreement? She could've said no, or agreed to my offer to buy my own additional data, but she told me to wait until the end of the month (which I wouldn't have had to do if I bought my own data) and now she's lashing out on me.

77,1c78qcv,AITA for yelling at my ex gf during her depressive episode?,"A few days ago my ex and I got into a pretty big argument, we tried to stay friends after breaking up a few months ago but things got rocky when some of the girls I hooked up with after we broke up just so happened to become friends with my ex. 

I didn’t expect them to get so close but I guess I should’ve expected it since they had similar friends, for context we are in college with me being M19 and my ex being F19. 

After I ended things with the last girl I hooked up with, I received an angry text from my ex over insta to which I couldn’t respond too because she blocked me immediately after. I was extremely upset, I truly do have deep feelings for her and care so much for her but didn’t realize how close she was to the girl I hooked up with.

I was pissed because I thought the other girl was talking shit, which in turn made my ex dislike me, I’ll admit I was a bit petty on my insta notes and I forgot many of my exes friends still followed me, and didn’t realize they all sent my notes to her, but eitherway I tried my best to move on.

I went on one date with another girl, she seemed sweet and kind but a few days after our first date she reached out to me, concerned because apparently someone told her that I was talking to my last hookup at the same time as my ex? that I was leading people on? and that I was just generally creepy and obsessive?

I was under the assumption that my ex was now talking shit and spreading things that weren’t true, I was angry. Within the next few days my ex reached out to me over text sending me screenshots of my insta notes, I got pissed telling her to leave me alone and to stay out of my business.

I’ll admit I was pretty aggressive in my texts I told her to stop victimizing herself, I called her a childish adult who does nothing but spread rumors. She kept telling me that she didn’t spread anything, that people must’ve gotten things mixed up and that she didn’t appreciate the way I was acting.

She seemed extremely depressed and I know she has depressive episodes but for some reason instead of consoling her I got really angry she said some concerning things about how she doesn’t care about anything anymore and she doesn’t wanna make it to twenty, but I told her to fuck off.

I ended it with telling her that I don’t ever want to talk to her again, and that I hope I never see her on the other side. Two days later I got a text from her mom telling me that my ex was in the hospital after an attempt. Apparently it’s pretty bad and she’s been in a coma for the past few days, I feel like absolute shit but all my friends say it’s not my fault.

I can’t even be on campus anymore because all her friends fucking hate me, everyone loves her and I feel like I really fucked things up and I just feel like an all around shitty guy.

I'm not the type of person to have a bias against anyone religious, and honestly, I'm past caring. But my mother is the type of person to force someone to sit down and pray, attend church and read the bible, even when I've told her many times I don't want to.

I was born into a catholic Christian household. While my dad is not particularly religious, my mother and my grandmother are. As of late, my mother has been extremely overwhelming. She gets angry when I don't want to sit down for evening prayers, which is ridiculous; I'm an adult. I'm nineteen. I know whether or not I want to be religious, and as of now, I don't. Going to church is fine, I can sneak off somewhere during the service. But if I don't sit down for prayers, she often cusses me out and goes on a tirade about how I don't love her or that I'm going to go to hell for not asking for forgiveness.

It's ridiculous. I know it is, but I've tried explaining to her that I don't feel a connection with any higher power, and I find all this overwhelming.

In her will, as she had no daughter, she asked her eldest son, my uncle Jim (51m), to take care of the jewelry. I have only seen pictures of the set growing up.

Uncle Jim’s been married for 8 years to uncle Bob (45m). He adopted uncle Bob’s daughter Lara (19f) a few years after. Lara and I got along OK as the only girls in our generation thought we have our own interests.

A week before, my family heard that uncle Jim had a fight with uncle Bob and went to stay with his friend and last we knew he took a spontaneous vacation overseas. A few days later Lara and uncle Bob asked to meet me.

Apparently, the reason they fought was because uncle Jim decided to leave the jewelry set to me in his will. He argued with uncle Bob that my grandma would have wanted me, her biological grandchild, to have the jewelry. Uncle Bob and Lara argued that since he adopted Lara, Lara is now the oldest girl in this generation and deserves the jewelry set. Uncle Jim stood his grounds, they fought, and he left.

They asked me to convince uncle Jim to give Lara the jewelry set, saying it would be the right thing to do.

My sister Jane needed to find a place to live and was one of the reasons my mom became homeless trying to help keep Jane afloat into adulthood. Jane has 4 children but has custody of two. These children are not well behaved and has been in and out of the foster system and has behavior issues.

Jane comes over to our house in the middle of the day. Something not allowed. She has her two kids with her on a school day. I and my family sees this on a ring cam. My mother knows we have one.

I call my mom. No answer. So my wife calls 911. Calls it a burglary. The police show up and arrest Jane and while my wife was on the phone my mother as well. My mom just started giving our stuff away to Jane.

82,1c786lj,AITA for breaking the rules that my mom and sister made for me after I promised them I wouldn't?,"I (20F) am a uni student. I had social difficulties growing up. I got bullied a lot for being ""too fat, weird, crazy, ugly and too much of a crybaby."" This bullying was especially bad when I was in grade 4. During that time, my teacher favored the bullies and my parents were getting divorced. 

In an attempt to fit in, I started listening to a few bands, A, B & C, as I had a feeling that they would all become popular among my peers. I gained an ecyclopedic amount of information about them, and ended up genuinely falling in love with all of them. A remains very popular while B & C have had their popularity be diminished, sadly. 

Admittedly, I sometimes have the tendency to harp on things for too long. People (a couple of friends, my mom and my sister) have told me that I monologue too much sometimes and I talk about the bands too much sometimes. I've been told that my monologing behavior when it comes to the bands sounds like a ""special interest"". I've been evaluated by a psychologist, and although my mom and some teachers suspected autism, the psychologist didn't diagnose me with autism. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety. 

Recently, 2 girls from school, Janet & Carmen, were gossiping about me at the store while following my mom around it (I was doing an exam at the time that they were at the store, so I only found out about what happened afterwards). Mom & sis decided I must change. They told me that at uni, I can only talk about A as they are mainstream and popular. They said only talking about mainstream & popular will help me to fit in & be better understood by my peers. I nodded my head to convince them that I agreed, but I secretly did not. One of my life mottos is that sometimes rules are just meant to be broken.

My sister went to the same uni I did, so she came with me on the train to & from uni to try and help me find my classes. While heading back home, I ran into my classmate, Sadie. Sadie greeted me, then asked how my Christmas break was. I said it was good. There was a storm, so we didn't really go anywhere. I got a hot chocolate machine with some packets that I was excited to try. Sadie then asked ""Did anything new happen with C? What about the exposing page about \[youngest member of C\] that is on Twitter?"" My sister started glaring with looks that could kill a man.

Sadie then changed the subject to talking about what courses we were taking this semester and what we are doing in them. She got off at her stop eventually. Then, sis sarcastically & passive-aggressively said ""That was nice"".

At dinner, it was just sis & I. I kept quiet while sis continued glaring. She then said ""I'm going to ask you a question I know you will be offended by. Why do kids in your classes know about the exposing page?"" I then retorted ""Why do you care?""

83,1c77kr9,AITA For buying a new gift for my BIL's wife instead of what my husband bought for her,"This coming weekend we are getting together with my husband's family at his mom's house.  My husband, my BIL, and BIL's wife all had birthdays in March so this is kind of a get-together to celebrate them all at once.  Last week I asked my husband if he had bought gifts for BIL and his wife and my husband said no.  He said we're all in our 30s, we don't need to buy gifts for birthdays anymore.  I told him that if we show up and they have gifts for him then it's going to look bad if we didn't get anything for them, too.  He said ""fine"" and told me he would look for something for them.  

The next day he told me he put some things in our Amazon cart for them and noticed that I had some things saved in there and asked if he should just get everything at once.  I told him to wait because there were other things I wanted to get first.  When I looked at what he bought, I didn't think the gift he got for BIL's wife was very good.

It was a desk calendar with silly daily affirmation quotes.  I didn't feel like he put much thought into it and it wasn't something she would really use.  So, I canceled that gift and got her some skin care items instead.  I left the gift he got for BIL alone, though.

The package arrived yesterday and when he opened it he mentioned to me that his gift for BIL's wife didn't ship yet so he would wrap BIL's gift and wait for the other to come.  I looked at what was in the box and told him that the skin care items were for BIL's wife.  

He said he thought I bought those for myself because he already got BIL's wife a gift.  I told him that I got her something different because I wanted to get her something she would actually use.  He got kind of upset and asked me why I even asked him to get her a gift if I was just going to pick something for her myself. I told him that his gift was OK, but I didn't think she would use it and I didn't think it was a big deal.

It kind of turned into an argument with him being upset that this is another example of me making him feel like my ideas are better than his.  He brought up a few times in the past when he had an idea and instead of me just going with it, I either changed it or came up with something else.  He told me that sometimes he wants me to just say ""that sounds good"" instead of me needing to have things ""my way.""  

I apologized and told him that we can order his original gift idea and I'll use the skin care stuff and he told me not to bother.  He said I already made him feel like crap and he doesn't want my pity.  He told me I should just do things myself if I don't trust him to do things so that he doesn't waste energy on things I'm just going to change anyway.  

I told him I didn't think it was a big deal and it's just a birthday gift.  He said if it's just a birthday gift, then why did I feel like I needed to supersede his idea.  I told him his gift for his brother was a good one and he said ""Oh, gee, thanks"" really sarcastically.   ",Asshole,2024-04-18,1.0,0.9931726,1,1

so basically he just told me that his goal is to meet up with them. which initially wouldn’t be a problem at all. the thing that makes it a problem tho is that he wants to fly across the continent alone to meet up with them, especially with this one girl. he and her are really close apparently. we’ve had multiple fights throughout our relationship that were mostly about her. things like them calling for hours without my knowledge or her talking about inappropriate things with him created big fights. i just learned that shes considering moving to his country too which gives me even more big feelings.

i have tried to talk about these things with him and i get shut down immediately. how dare i step into his life knowing those things and wanting to change them (he told me of their friendship after we started dating). ive tried finding solutions that would work for both of us like us using it as a holiday and them just getting to meet up once or twice while we are there but apparently nothings enough. he wants to be with her for more than that and without me. he’s probably even sleep at her place since he currently has no job and no money to afford a hotel or literally anything.

85,1c77bqr,AITA for telling my husband's cousin she shouldn't have thrown a gender reveal party?,"Both me (29F) and my husband's cousin Lena (fake name; 27F) are pregnant. I'm due in late May, while she's due in August. My baby will be my second child (I have a three year old son), and hers is her first.

Lena and I aren't particularly close (and to be honest, I'm not fond of her), but since we're both pregnant, we've been talking more often than usual. It was during those conversations that she expressed wanting a baby girl. She specifically said she couldn't see herself raising a boy.

Last month, Lena hosted a gender reveal party, and found out she's having a son.

She was visibly disappointed after finding out the sex of her baby. She threw on a fake smile during the actual reveal, but didn't keep it up for long. For the rest of the party, Lena remained frustrated, and was cold and short with everyone who tried to congratulate her.

I don't know if Lena told anyone else that she wanted a girl, but her disappointment has gotten pretty obvious. Since her party, she's been less excited about her pregnancy. We've been speaking less, because she doesn't even want to talk about her baby anymore. Her sadness has earned her some sympathy and support from my in-laws.

My baby shower will take place this weekend. I'm having a girl, but my husband and I decided to wait until birth to reveal that. As such, none of my in-laws have been informed.

A couple days ago, Lena called to ask about my baby's gender. She said that if I'm expecting a girl, she won't come to the baby shower. When I asked why, she said she's still ""mourning her daughter"", and doesn't want to be reminded that she's not having a girl. She also said that since she'd shared her reveal with the family, it was only fair I told her.

I reminded her we weren't telling anyone until birth, but told her she was welcome to avoid the shower if she wasn't comfortable attending. Lena continued to pressure me to tell her, but I stood my ground. After some back and forth, she told me I was being inconsiderate, as I knew how devastated she'd been. She said she deserved to know if I was about to ""rub my happiness in her face.""

That's when I ran out of patience. I told Lena that if having a boy was that awful to her, she shouldn't have thrown herself a gender reveal in the first place. I said that she could stop celebrating her pregnancy if she wanted to, but she can't dictate what I do about mine.

Lena is furious. She told my in-laws that I was kicking her out of my baby shower. I told everyone the truth, but many are still on her side. They're saying that it's rude of me to dismiss Lena's pain, and that I should be more graceful towards her.

86,1c775pf,AITA for not seeing my dad on Father’s Day because I’m moving,"I’m having trouble making the time to see my dad on Father’s Day and he’s really upset. My wife got accepted into grad school several states away from where we currently live. We’re moving at the beginning of June to our new place. 

Then 3 weeks later, I will be starting a new job and will be required to train in person several states away from where I’m moving to. My wife and son will be traveling with me to where I’m training, and we’ll all come back just in time for her to begin school. The goal is to get moved into my new place in the 3 weeks I’ll be there i June, and come back from training to a house that’s fully settled in.

My dad wants to see me on Father’s Day. He originally wanted me to come to his house, which again, is several states away from where I’m moving to, but that’s not going to work. He got really upset and we talked about maybe having him travel to see us. Weeks have passed since we talked about this and my wife and I have come to the conclusion that we are kind of overwhelmed by all the moving parts and are in no capacity to host anyone at our apartment right after we move in, and right before we have to move again for my training.

I mentioned this to my dad and he said this is completely fucked and that I should always make time to see my dad on Father’s Day. 

TL;DR: I am moving twice in one month and could see my dad on Father’s Day but will be too overwhelmed from the moves to make it work.

It’s very frustrating that I have to deal with this everyday. They don’t even help out in basic chores at all.

89,1c76hkv,AITA For getting angry when my bf went on a stag,"Hello I want to know if I’m over reacting or not. So my bf of 1year and a half recently went on a stag abroad with his friends. A classic stag has activities such as strip clubs and having one “last night of freedom”. I personally think these ideas are out dated. 

I said to him before he went that if everyone wanted to go to a strip club then obviously I wouldn’t be upset as I didn’t want him to be left out. I did say that if it’s only two or three people maybe he could give it a miss as it makes me uncomfortable. (There were 12 of them going) 

I actually felt pretty good the whole weekend and trusted him to respect what I had said. However, when he returned and confessed they went to a strip club which turned out to be a brothel. I was filled with so many emotions - angry that he hadn’t thought about my feelings and a surge of sadness that he admitted it not even realising it would upset me. 

Now he said he didn’t do anything -just walked around through the club before sitting in the smoking area. His friends did buy some services which he told me about in great detail. 

I told him how it upset me that he didn’t think to leave since there were 10 of them who were just “sitting around”. Perhaps they could have gone when he realised. He said that he didn’t realise that it would upset me so much and he thought I’d find it funny. 

I now don’t know what to do as I’m in two minds. Am I the arsehole for being upset with him ?",Asshole,2024-04-18,1.0,1.0521892,1,1
90,1c768bk,AITA for my dog stealing a tennis ball?,"For context, my dog is well generally well behaved. His only weakness is he has an incredibly strong drive for balls and specifically loves to steal balls away from other dogs at the park. I am actively working on training this out of him. Normally I make sure we are away from other dogs playing fetch in the park, and typically just skip the park if there are lots of dogs. We haven’t had a ball stealing incident for months until this morning.

Before you ask, no he does not drop the ball for treats or food. Believe me, I’ve tried. 

This morning I went to the park and it was empty. It’s a BIG park. 

A man arrives with his dog. I have known this guy for four years and he knows that my dog will steal balls. He usually asks if it’s okay to throw a ball if I’m close by. When he asks me, I typically I ask him to wait  so I can get my dog and move to another area, or I just opt to leave so he can have the space.

There have been a couple times in the past where my dog has gotten this guy’s ball, and he has always been understanding and tells us to keep it for the day. I would always come back the next day and return the ball to him.

Today, he decides to throw the ball straight towards my dog without asking. Of course my dog steals it immediately. I let him know, “hey, I’m gonna try and get your ball back, but you know how my dog is. I need to head out for work in about 15 minutes as well.” He said “oh it’s really no problem at all. It’s just a ball.”

After a while of trying to get my dog on leash, I realize I’m running late for work. The guy is at the other side of the park. I see him everyday and always return his ball, I figure I’ll just leave and return it tomorrow. 

Halfway home, I hear the guy yelling at me. He wants his ball back. I stopped walking and wrestled the ball out of my dog’s mouth. I typically try to avoid doing this because it reinforces protective behavior. Finally got the ball out and returned it to the him.  He said “that was not cool, you were just trying to steal my ball.”  I gave the ball back and I didn’t explain myself because I was late for work, and just wanted to go home. I told him “I’m so sorry for the mix up, that wasn’t my intention.” And continued on home.

91,1c767km,AITA For Yelling At Someone At A Craft Market,"So. I, F25, am a crafter, I crochet and do some other things and have just started selling them at markets. I have made some commissioned work but it has mostly been for friends and family. I have full time job and only craft to relieve stress. I started selling at markets for the sole fact that I have an excess amount of stuff and didn't want to just give it away as it does take time and money to make. 

 I sell my items for cheaper than most people.

At my first market this past weekend I was approached by another crocheter, I had seen their name on the list but hadn't had a chance to look at any of their items. Though some customers had told me that my prices were much cheaper, and we were selling some pretty different looking things.  when they walked up they introduced themselves, I'll call them Mary for sake of simplicity.  Mary looked around and immediately was bumping customers out of the way to pick things up and was making comments about how much I was undercharging. Mary then began to very loudly talk about how much they charger for their stuff for and how I needed to raise prices. I just smiled and said ""yah know maybe I will after this first market"" and they continued to pick things up and comment of everything saying I was cheapening myself. . I started to ignore them as I had someone asking a question about another thing. Mary walked off yelling about wanting to talk more and that they'd be back by. I just brushed it off. 

ABout 15 minutes later Mary returned to my table and again began talking about how if I wanted to make money I needed to charge more. This time bringing a blanket with them. This blanket was very similar to one I had made - I found the pattern on Pinterest so not surprising. Talking about how they charged a little over $300 for it and I was only charging $85. I explained that I used a nice brand of yarn but it didn't take me long to finish. They kept saying how they charged $16 and hour for labor and then adde materials and etc to the cost. I replied that If that works for them then that's what works, but I didn't think I needed to sell my stuff for that much. 

I turned to accept payment from someone else. Mary then cam around the table to beside this customer and continued saying I needed to do better and that I brought crochet a bad name because I made everyone else's work look cheap. I told them we can talk about it later or They can bring it to the market boards attention and they can tell me to raise the price. They then grabbed the debt card from my customer and told me I needed to charge them more. I was fed up. I screamed for them to go back to their booth and please leave me alone. That my prices were not their concern and they should be worried about their work. 

I was contacted by the board and told that due to me actions I was more than likely not going to be welcome back at this market. Am I the Asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,0.0042178407,0,1

I’m going over to my ex’s place to get the rest of my things. I am SEVERELY tempted to pick up an item that is technically his. 

Backstory:
I’m a huuuge Halloween fan. He is also a fan of Halloween. We were going to a party together this past Halloween and he thought it would be fun to do matching outfits. I make costumes, so this of course, fell to me. I was nearly done with his outfit when I made a mention of “couples costume” and taking cute pictures together at the party to post online. 

“Well I don’t care if you post us online, but we’re not a couple, I’m just your partner.”

One, how tf does that even make sense, and two, fucking screeching halt on doing anything for him. Obviously we had a big fight and I got my things and left. Then we talked about it, he apologized (saying he was just having a hard time with the titles but yes I was his girlfriend and it’s just his avoidant attachment style and he’s working on it), we made up and he asked me if we could still go to the party together. I agreed because I’d already put in all the work and id forgiven him at this point (dumb move on my end I know). So I finish the costumes, we go to the party, have a great time, looking fine af. About two weeks later, the same issue pops back up. “We’re not a couple and we never have been.” TF YOU MEAN WE ARENT A COUPLE WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THIS YOU LITERALLY CALLED ME YOUR GIRLFRIEND JFC. 

We’ve been off/on ever since because I struggle learning lessons apparently, BUT I’ve finally passed with flying colors. I’m picking up my stuff for the last time, and I want to take the costume with me.


I spent hours, and I mean HOURS, making this for him. The cost in time, materials, and labor makes it quite a pricey piece. I want it back and I also don’t want to show up to the mutual halloween parties and run into him and we happen to match. That would just be weird. 

So I’m guessing I would probably be the AH if I actually took it back. I leave it in the hands of the internet to tell me what to do.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,1.0513674,1,0
95,1c75oic,AITA for not walking my parents dog,"Hey so a bit of background I 20M live at home with both my parents 49M and 46F (cost of living in the UK is making it impossible to rent a place alone on minimum wage). I pay rent to live with them and I help out around the house with domestic tasks and take turns cooking dinner with them. My parents have a dog which I do love dearly however he isn’t really trained and hasn’t been taught many commands. Now this isn’t usually as issue for me as my dad is the one who walks him everyday but my dad has to go away a lot for work at the moment and my mother works long hours. 

So my parents have asked me to walk him while they’re away. I did walk him for three days in a row but he pulls on the lead, barks at any other dogs and doesn’t follow any commands outside of the house. It’s way too stressful for me and I get so frustrated especially as he’s not my dog and I’m more of a cat person. 

I talked to my mother and said I didn’t want to walk him anymore, her response was we feed your cat if your not in. However I always feed their dog and let him out when they’re not home it’s just the walking him that I can’t deal with. Also something further to point out my cat is an indoor cat but I take him on the garden on a harness for a few hours a day, which my parents don’t do if I’m not home. When I pointed this out to my mother her response was a cat doesn’t need to go out but the dog does need to walked everyday or he’s a nightmare with too much energy. My response was well that’s your issue I didn’t choose to get a dog they did so therefore it’s my mothers responsibility to walk him if my dads away. 

She says I’m an arsehole for leaving her with this task knowing she has a stressful job, and when I spoke to my friends they said I should just do it as it’s not a massive job and I’m being a twat about it. So I just wanted to know am I the arsehole for not walking a dog that isn’t mine? 

Just to add in an edit every dog we’ve had before this one was untrained and as a child it was left to me to walk them even though I have never wanted a dog. The only reason they started walking this dog was because I refused to do it and he didn’t get walked for a month. I’m scared if I walk him while my dads away this responsibility will end up being pushed onto me again.

96,1c75obz,AITA for calling my MIL and FIL naive?,"Ever since I (29f) got married four months ago my ILs (60s) have brought up the fact I didn't invite anyone from my biological family to the wedding and have asked me why I don't at least make an attempt to reconnect with my half siblings. I explained to them that I did not feel it would be worth my time. My ILs argued that it has been more than a decade since I last saw or spoke to any of them and a lot of things could have changed in that time. They told me they see how longingly I look at my husband and siblings sometimes when they're being typical siblings or how I stare off in the distance at times when we're all together and I experience being part of a happy family with them. They say they know I long for that with my own biological family.

I admitted to them that I wish it had been possible but I know in my heart of hearts that it's not possible and I found acceptance in that a long time ago.

I feel I should touch on some background here. My father was a married man when he met and had an affair with my mother of which I am the result. His family found out about me when I was a baby or a toddler and his marriage ended as a result. His other children were in their teens at the time and they hated me for being born. I have a number of scattered memories of them. I never lived with them. But I saw them on occasion when I was with my father. They were hateful, they were cruel, and they made it very clear to me at a very young age that they did not want anything to do with me. My father would whine for them to be nicer. But he never really stood up for me and he never tried protecting me either. My mother grew to resent me for the ending of the affair/her relationship with my father. She treated me terribly from middle school onward until I cut off all contact when I was 19. I was 17 the last time I saw or heard from any of my half siblings. I was the same age the last time I heard from my father or saw him.

I explained my background in more detail with my ILs. They knew I was an ""affair baby"" (a term I hate because I did not choose to be born to a married man and another woman) but not how much the distain expressed in my childhood. My ILs asked if I had tried reaching out to my father's ex wife because surely she would want her kids and me to have a better relationship. But if I couldn't reach her, they said they bet my half siblings have been waiting for me to make contact for years and would love to know me today because family.

I was actually startled by how naive they sounded saying all this. I told them there was no way the ex wife would help because she hadn't wanted me anywhere near her kids. I also told them my half siblings were all older than I am now when I last saw them and they still hated me so I held no hope for change. They told me I didn't know and I told them I could not afford to be as naive as them. They were hurt I called them that. My husband told them it was naive to think the way they did.

My dad has two associates (colleagues? don’t even know tbh) who are father and son. This concerns the son Randy (26M). I’ve met him a few times. 

My dad has mentioned two things about Randy to me before. He mentioned that Randy thought i was pretty (he assumed I was older because other people in my job role are in their 20s) and that when all of that was cleared up, he said he didn’t think that i should get things handed to me just because i was ‘sad’, meaning my job. I’ve always brushed it aside because he doesn’t know me, and I want to be professional. Additionally, Randy is currently working in the type of role I hope to progress to in the future so I’ve been secretly hoping that we can get along so I can learn a thing or two from him. 

I had a bit of a relapse in my mental health and spent a lot of time last week too anxious to leave my bedroom. My dad rang me last night and told me to get ready as he wanted to take me to dinner with Randy and his father. It was semi-business related but it was supposed to be informal. 

As soon as we got there, Randy shook my hand and squeezed it pretty hard. Randy is a very tall guy who works out so this hurt a lot. I said ‘ouch’ pretty loudly and pulled my hand from his grip. My dad asked me what happened, and the tears came pouring. I was so embarrassed and I’m not usually like this but I was already feel so anxious and nervous and I couldn’t handle anything.

102,1c74ta9,AITA for asking for permission to break a promise?,"I'm trying to emigrate to Germany to be an apprentice in a trade, and I've got a few friends in the country. Most of them live in 1 town, and a single friend lives in another town along the same regional train line, so you can get between the 2 towns in a couple hours.

To make a long story incredibly incredibly short: I suggested moving to the town of my one friend over a month ago, and she asked me not to because it's a PTSD trigger. I agreed. I've got PTSD too, I know the feeling.

After I started looking for jobs, over 100 applications in the city of most of my friends, and I came up with nothing. And because it takes a few months to process a visa, I was running short on time. If I don't have an offer in hand by May, this whole plan falls apart because it takes 2 - 3 months for the Visa, and the apprenticeships all start in August.

Out of desperation I applied to a bunch of other places. Other, less attractive, trades in the target city, other cities relatively train accessible to my friends. I sent out dozens in a flurry everywhere I could think of.

But I also sent a handful to the city I promised not to move to, as an absolute last resort.

And those handful of jobs replied almost immediately, and one gave me an offer just as fast, because the interview process for apprentices is quite short. I've been working towards an apprenticeship in this field and learning German so I can move there for a long while, and suddenly I could have it if I just said yes.

So I asked her if I could break my promise as a last resort. And I said if the answer is still no, I'll give up the job offer and cancel all interviews in that city, and keep looking. I was continuing to look anyway, hoping I'd hear back from anyone at all in my target city. I was asking so I didn't hit the time limit on my offer and have to choose without giving her a chance to weigh in.

She didn't reply immediately, and the next day I got like, 4 other interview requests, so I asked again a couple days later, adding that it was no longer a choice between ""move to Germany this year instead of waiting and trying again next year"", so she could absolutely say no and things would probably still turn out okay, it wouldn't cost me my dream.

She said no, and I rejected the offer and cancelled the interview.

But she also blocked me, because she remembered me promising to never even suggest it. She's probably right. Me forgetting a detail of what I promised has happened before. She doesn't know I rejected the offer and cancelled the interview.

It's definitely not her fault. PTSD is no joke, you can't control your triggers, and if I'm unintentionally making her life worse, this is for the best, as much as it kills me to say goodbye on such bad terms. And it doesn't matter what I thought the letter of my promise was, the spirit was definitely already broken by asking.

103,1c74mna,AITA for asking my MIL to stop rehashing my miscarriage?,"I (33 F) have 2 kids (3F and 3 month M). Before I got pregnant with my oldest, I had a miscarriage at just around 5 months. This was almost 5 years ago. It was very sad—we already had a name picked out (James), and we had told everyone I was pregnant.

In the past years, I have moved on from what happened. While it makes me generally sad to think about the baby I never had, I don’t feel the way I feel about my dad or my cousin, who have both passed away. I don’t really consider myself a mother to three children. Just the two who I have gotten to know in the world. I feel like I am at peace.

My MIL does not feel the same way. She’s very sweet, but she talks a lot about the miscarriage and it makes me uncomfortable. When my youngest was born, she kept making comments like “James is with us today!” And “your third little one, how exciting!” On that day, I politely asked her if we could focus on my new baby instead, and she seemed to get it the day of.

But in the past few months, she has continued to talk about James and how he must be watching over his new little brother. She bought a little angel decoration for my youngest’s room which is meant to symbolize James. The other day, she referred to me as a mom of three. I snapped at her and asked if she could stop talking about the baby I never had. I asked her to keep those thoughts to herself when she has them and to refer to me as a mom of two in the future (which I have asked her to do before). 

She got very sad after that, started crying, and left. I reached out to her later and apologized for snapping and yelling, and she was very gracious but she said she didn’t think she was in the wrong because she was just “honoring a lost life.” She didn’t call me an asshole, but I sort of felt like one because she sort of accused me of “dishonoring” a life.

104,1c74k2l,AITA for grounding my son for how he acted towards my ex’s nephew?,"My ex-wife (31F) and I (31M) have one kid together, our son, Edison (12M), we divorced 2 years ago, when Edison was 10.

We have joint custody over Edison and sometimes I’ll be at my ex’s family events that Edison wants to go to (like birthday parties). Edison has a cousin, Ayrton (11M) who turns 12 next month, and his family had the birthday party yesterday as they’re going on a trip in May.

Ayrton and Edison go to the same school, Ayrton is in 6th and Edison is in 7th. They go to a Catholic middle school despite our family being atheist. The best schools in our area are private Catholic schools, many students who attend them are atheist or Jewish and that’s where I met my ex, despite us both coming from atheist families. Ayrton was also raised atheist but now identifies as Catholic.

Ayrton being the one out of the nieces and nephews to become religious makes a lot of sense, he’s always believed in good luck charms (like a keychain a friend gave him) and maneki-neko cats (Japanese cat figurines that allegedly bring good luck) and genuinely believes they’re good luck. We’ve had issues with Edison in the past mocking Ayrton for his belief in the maneki-neko cats and told him to respect his cousin. Edison is into science like me, I’m a high school chemistry teacher. I’ve told Edison to respect others beliefs even if they’re not rooted in science.

We ate dinner and had cake at Ayrton’s parent’s house and Ayrton started to open up presents, he got this vintage basketball jersey he wanted and took off the shirt he was wearing to put it on. This revealed the rosary he was wearing under his shirt, it was a cute little necklace with basketballs as the rosary beads.

Edison almost immediately made a joke about Ayrton being a “f\*g” for wearing the necklace, he asked Ayrton if he was “becoming a girl”. He kept doing this until we left.

Edison has a very, very extensive history of bullying that includes being expelled from multiple preschools and elementary schools. He is constantly in detention or getting suspended now that he’s in middle school. This behavior started long before our divorce, but my ex blames the divorce and doesn’t really believe in psychology, so he only sees a therapist twice a month, during my weeks. My insurance from work covers this and Edison will always complain about going, but I feel it’s important for him.

Edison’s most recent bad behavior has included using slurs and other concerning behavior, which I’ve mentioned to his therapist.

On the car ride home, I told Edison he was grounded and told him he’d give me the phone once we got home. He started to text my ex and when I got home, she was calling me.

I answer the phone and she said I had no right to ground him for this because it could hurt his relationship with Ayrton and Ayrton isn’t my nephew. She said that I have “no right” to ruin the relationship between Edison and her family members. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,1.0222005,1,0
105,1c742y5,WIBTA if I (29m) didn't let my friend (28f) pay me back with diving lessons she got for free?,"My friend was really stupid and was driving drunk and totalled a car she was renting monthly. She had to pay $3500 and I lent her the money because she didn't want to ask her parents. We were dating at the time and this happened when I went to visit her for 2 weeks on a Caribbean island where she was doing an internship. 

Fast forward, she is on a different caribbean island and got a job there. I am visiting her in a week, now as my ex-girlfriend. She offered to ""pay for my advanced open water diving course"" to help pay off her debt, which to me doesn't make sense because then she would spend the same amount of money and doesn't help her pay me off. I also don't want to do it on this island because it is way more expensive than in other places.

When I visited her on the other island she knew someone and said she could get me PADI-certified for free, and they did it. But then later she held it over me and expected me to pay for everything, when I thought she was doing it as a nice gesture and not to get things out of me. And she didn't pay this person to give me the lessons, it was a favor to her as a friend. 

Now, it seems again she must have connections and can get someone to do the lessons for cheap or free, and this way she doesn't have to pay me back as much money. After offering to ""pay"" my advanced diving course she said, ""I mean you are already staying with me for free."" That really rubbed me the wrong way. I am spending over $1000 to visit you, she is the one that was begging me to visit... We have a complicated relationship and we had a big fight about the money situation last time, because it felt to me she was very transactional, ""oh I got you diving lessons so now you owe me"", instead of ""oh I got you diving lessons because I love you and want to do nice things for you and dive with you.""

So now I don't want to accept the diving lesson offer because I said I didn't want to do the lessons there because it was so expensive, and she seemed offput. WIBTA if I said no?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,0.041503847,0,1
106,1c741rd,AITA for not agreeing to give my mom $5k from my back pay?,"To preface this, I (30f) have always had a rocky relationship with my mom (52f). I feel like there has been a lack of support from my mom even well before I turned 18. TW: History of abuse and neglect due to the men she has been in relationships with. 

I started working when I was 16 and aside from housing, I worked for everything I wanted/ needed for myself. I started paying rent to live with her as soon as I turned 18 and moved out when I was 20. I had been completely independent since then.

However, I moved back in with my mom after my divorce (a little over 3 years ago). About a year later I was hit with a lot of health issues and I’ve been unable to work since. 

These past two years have been hell for me. I have seen several specialists and had to deal with a lot of doctors who didn’t believe me or thought I was exaggerating. 

Turns out I have rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and they also found I had a super rare brain tumor (even the neurosurgeon had never seen in person) that I had removed in September of 2022. I deal with chronic pain and fatigue daily. The tumor has also left me with some cognitive difficulties. I had neuropsychological testing done and my memory, processing speed, and fine motor skills are all well below average range. 

For these past two years I have been fighting to get approved for disability as well; which has also been a struggle due to the fact that the last thing they want to do is approve a 30 year old. Went through 2 denials and had my hearing this past January. I found out last week that I’ve finally been approved! 

My mom knows that buying my own car is my top priority. She bought a car for me before I moved back and all was good while I was making the payments (a little over a year.) I’ve offered to give her the remaining $10k that she paid, but she has decided she wants to keep the car instead. 

A few hours after I told her I was approved she wanted to talk about money and what I would be giving her for letting me stay here. The plan she came up with was for me to buy a car for $10k, keep $5k and give her $5k. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate her providing me a place to stay while I’ve been unable to work, but I do think asking for a quarter of my back pay is unfair. 

I also believe she has a double standard involving money. Her deciding to keep the car she bought for me means I am completely out the $4k I did pay into it (which she thinks is fair), but was upset I wasn’t comfortable with the amount she asked for because “it’s not fair for me to have all that money” and to “not take care of her when I get something good.”

Her reasoning on it is what really didn’t sit right with me. It is definitely a huge relief to have finally been approved, but I don’t see it as “getting something good.” I got approved for disability, It’s not like I won the lottery or something. 

In the end we compromised on $3k, which I feel more comfortable with giving than $5k. I thought that would be the end of it, but there’s been a lot of tension in the house since. I’m wondering if I was in the wrong here?

107,1c73owe,AITA for not wanting to take care of my grandma anymore?,"I’m 27 and I moved into my grandmas house with my fiancé and two kids to help care for her. She had 6 months to live 6 months ago and signed herself off hospice so now I have no help at all. One thing I can’t stand is her fireplace is on no matter how hot it is outside. It’s so hot that we have a hard time sleeping at night. And no one wants to visit. She does everything she can to get to her cigarettes but acts like she can’t throw her wrappers in the trash or rinse out her milk cups. She has also refused to shower since hospice left. I do all the cooking and cleaning and I do everything she asks. 
Mind you, to move in here we had to clean 3 bedrooms and a living room upstairs and spent our money replacing flooring. I had no help physically or financially from my dad or my grandma. Since January we have paid about 3k fixing a house that’s not mine. 
Her house was built for her and paid off already. The house is in my dad’s name. He told me if I stayed to care for her I can live here when she passes away and only have to pay the insurance and taxes yearly (along with my utilities etc.) and he is apparently in charge of repairs and mowing the yard. 
He hasn’t fixed anything or mowed the yard since we got here. This house is trashed. It was built in the 80s and has no upgrades. My uncle who is a meth addict lived here for years and tore up the yard and the house pretty badly. 90% of the damages and trash are from him. 
My dad and I got into an argument a couple days ago because I asked if he or my grandma can replace 30 year old washed out gravel that has a plastic liner exposed. My dog keeps tearing it up and chewing on it. The gravel has been washed out for about 10 years now. 
I was told my dog dug up the gravel (she did not and if she did I would pay for it) and that I had to pay for it. I told him I’m not paying for anything else right now in a house that’s not mine and may never be mine. I don’t have any money and I already spent money to move into this house and take care of his mom. I am providing her a service she obviously can’t afford- I did not come here to take care of her and pay for everything. Washed out gravel is basic maintenance and upkeep on a yard that has to be replaced every so often. 
He told me I was ungrateful and that I should move out and never come back. I’m confused how I’m ungrateful for moving in here to take care of HIS MOM. I feel like I’m being taken advantage of. And with my dad acting like his is now with not mowing the yard or replacing things he’s not going to do anything once she passes away. He is acting like a slumlord. This house is trashed already and if he doesn’t want to help me fix it (it’s his house) why should I live here and pay his taxes and insurance?? 

Am I the asshole for really wanting to move out and not come back? I want to save up money and get another place and not even tell anyone just move and not come back. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,-0.005970427,0,1

ok so Im (21F) and the two friends who this post is about are ""Rita"" (20F) and ""Nia"" (22F). Rita and Nia have been best friends for the past 3 years and I became friends with Rita almost 1 year ago and we just hangout as a trio even tho I'm not that close to Nia. 

We are in university studying medicine and our exams are coming up in a few weeks so me and Rita decided to group study whenever we can and Nia was against it because she is exceptionally smart, it she studies for one day she can pass with flying colours so she didn't want to start studying weeks in advance but me and Rita do so we told her that we will still do it and she is free to come along with us and study if shed like so she begrudgingly agreed too. 

Nia constantly tries to make us stop studying by trying to talk about random stuff and tries to convince us to do something else, Rita frquently gives in to her demands which annoys me and they always say that ""it'll just be a 15min break"" but they always end up taking 1-2 hours so I've stopped taking ""breaks"" with them and just keep studying.

Anyways so I was gonna skip my class yesterday because I was feeling a little under the weather and just didn't feel like leaving my room. Rita asked me if I'd come and we could study together and I told her that I don't really feel like it but she insisted and I said fine but I'll only come if she didn't leave with Nia today, when I'm only coming per her request and she promised she wouldn't. 

So we met up and surprise suprise Nia tried to get us to do anything but study with her and Rita ended up agreeing and I was like wtf? you promised you wouldn't do this and Nia said that they're only getting coffee and they'll come straight back, I didn't believe them but I said whatever, they weren't back for an hour so I just went back home and they called and texted me asking where I was 2 hours after that, meaning they were gone for 3+ hours.

I didn't reply to them and was upset/cold to them today and they gave me half assed apologies and said they got distracted and ""hey atleast you were productive"" and just shit that kept annoying me even more. They never owned up to anything and because I wouldn't stop being cold they snapped and told me I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill and overreacting over something so minor.

111,1c72m2l,AITA for getting upset that he is trying to dictate where my funds go? ,"I get a little over $600 a month from disability. It's very little but it's more than enough to cover my personal bills and to cover diapers and wipes for my kids. 

Next month I calculated the funds to allow me to purchase a new cheap Office chair for my desk. The chair I'm currently using is hurting my back and hips very badly to the point I can barely get out of bed the next day. It's not an office chair but one of those novelty type chairs, I've just been using in the meantime until I get a better chair. It's VERY uncomfortable especially for longer periods of time. 

My fiancé woke me up this morning to tell me that I was stupid to even consider buying a new chair when I already have one I've been using. He went on to tell me about past purchases and how I was stupid to spend the money on those (such as a bookbag when I don't go to school anymore. I bought it to keep my self study books in. A gaming console I don't use often apparently. I use it nearly weekly, I just don't have the time to spend every single day playing games. A desk that broke in a year. I needed a desk, I went out of my way to try to find a very cheap within budget desk. It worked while I had it. Etc) 

Because of all this that he is STILL going on and on about I got upset. When he asked why I'm upset I told him 'because you literally woke me up early this morning just to b!tch at me about how I spend my money. You're acting like my sister.' (My sister treats me like a small child basically. She's never once acted like I'm an adult despite me being almost 30) 

Now he's angry at me and telling me I have no right to be upset. 

I could maybe understand his view point but I carefully calculated this chair into my check. I won't buy it until after all other bills are paid and diapers and wipes are bought. Nothing is being put aside for this purchase. My kids needs will be met next month. I'll still have extra money left over after the chair too for emergencies, just $100 less than if I didn't buy the chair.

They had been together for 10 years, married for 2 and he died in a car accident when mom was 7 months pregnant with me. She met my (adoptive) dad when I was 9 months old and they got married and he adopted me before I was 2. I had minimal contact with my biological extended family as a kid. Mom didn't give them much access to me. But she did allow some. She never talked about my biological dad though. We had no photos of him at all. I had a pretty happy childhood. I did sometimes wish I had a photo of dad. But it wasn't until a few months ago that I had some more feelings about this.

One of my friends and his girlfriend had a baby. It was a big deal because he's 19 and his parents hadn't wanted him to be such a young dad. I'm 19 too so it was surreal for me as well. But seeing him so excited to be a dad and getting ready for the baby and even afterward made me think of my biological dad. It made me think about how excited he was to be a dad and then he died so he was basically erased from the picture and never talked about to the kid he loved and wanted by the wife he loved so much. It made me kind of mad and sad. I sat with it for a few days and then one day I went to see my mom while my dad was at work. I asked her if she would tell me more about my biological dad and she refused to. She told me we didn't need to talk about that and imagine how my dad would feel if he walked in.

Jerry brings the Switch to camp every day and I allow him to, and he has taken the Switch plenty of times before, so I am not worried.

  
Jerry is a bit of a screw-up: Does not remember things he needs to do, procrastinates.  
Jerry bought all extra Joy-Cons and an extra pro controller for the Switch because he also plays it a lot, probably more than me.

  
Come 9:00 today, and I wake to a text from Jerry(6:00): ""Forgot to leave it, didn't bother to move"" and I was enraged. Jerry had betrayed my trust, hurt my feelings, and couldn't be bothered to care about his brother for 5 minutes? I told him immediately to not take the Switch outside the house anymore.  
10 minutes later, Jerry responds with a threat of not allowing me to use any controllers (minus the 2 that came with the console) and a consolidation attempt of telling me to use his PC and mine to play a shared game(fun but not as good as the Nintendo Switch).

  
I told Jerry that what really annoyed me he couldn't care about me for 5 seconds and in response, Jerry said that he woke up, read my text, and went to sleep.  
After Jerry told me not to hold a grudge, a thing I rarely do, I repeated what I had to say and Jerry said: ""Deal with it, you're overreacting"".

  
Jerry then went on a small rant and it boils down to: you have to make a huge thing out of something I literally apologized for and two paragraphs of explaining what happened. It looked like Jerry was not even trying to make things right with me, he was just trying to get his Switch privileges back.

  
This really triggered me and I went on a MASSIVE rant that dug into some really personal stuff about him and some things I apologized for how I said them later during the phone call.  
In response, Jerry told me that we are not on speaking terms and he'll bring the switch over. Jerry then called me and told me that he will be really bummed out if I don't give him another chance and it again. I put my foot down and said no and Jerry then told me: So don't touch any of my things. In response, I have sent him a Venmo for half of a set of Joy-con controllers and the switch pro controller, this way I can still play with them.

  
I have sent him a Venmo for half the price of the controllers total so that I can use them.  
Keep in mind, my mother was in the house when I woke up and she agreed that I should not let him use the Switch anymore because ""consequences for your actions"". She also agreed it was a d word move not to write that he did not bother to try for 5 seconds to make.

118,1c6z0to,AITA for telling my Co-Worker to shut his big mouth?,"I have no idea if I might have gone overboard so I'm asking you reddit people.

Around a month ago a traumatizing event happened to me in my neighborhood. I told the police and went to the hospital and overall was traumatized and scared for a couple of days. First I told my boyfriend and my closest friends about this event and they were all supportive of me and helped me through this rough time. 

A little information, I consider my workgroup very supportive and I think of them as my second family. We have two groups and I told the first group (my workgroup) what had happened because I trust them. I asked if this could stay between us and they all supported the idea and agreed.

My friend, **L**, was actually the one that told me what had happened. I hadn't told him yet because I didn't know how to break the news to him, he is such a sweetheart and I didn't want to upset him.

One person in my group, **P**, I'm not so close with, but when we talk it's mostly just fun and games. I knew since the beginning that he has a big mouth but he had promised me not to tell anyone, so I trusted him with what I told him.

When **L** told me that he had found out I asked him where he got that information from and he had told me one of his friends called him over and informed him about my situation. (Keep in mind I didn't tell his friend about it either.)

I went around and asked almost everybody where they had heard about it and they all said the same, that **P** had told them when they were alone.

I confronted **P** about it and he kept on telling me that it wasn't him that went around, but my boyfriend the day after it had occured when I wasn't around. I knew he was lying because my boyfriend wasn't at work that day because he was at my house, comforting my about the whole situation.

I just stood there while he kept going and going, and I just snapped. 

""How can you just stand there and lie to my face huh? I know it wasn't my boyfriend so stop trying to convince me it was him! Everyone tells me that it was you and you're the only one that say differently. Are you that selfish and self-absorbed to tell MY story when I strictly told you not to? YOU WEREN'T THERE so you have NO right to tell them and if they really wanted to know you could've said they had to ask me. Do me a favor and leave me alone, I don't want to see you right now.""

He walked away and it has been 2 days since we last talked. He can't even look at me and I'm starting to think I went a bit overboard with my words.

119,1c6yz8z,"WIBTA If I abandon my ""team"" in the intercampus tournament my college organize ?","
I , 18F am a first year student in a college in which I study political science. 

A week ago , I saw that there will be a intercampus tournament of sport and arts. In the art section , there is a category for fashion and sewing.
I LOVE SEWING , sewing is the thing I like to do the most ! Honestly , I don't mean to brag but I'm generally proud of the pieces I make. 
So , of course , I went to the organisions (of my campus) which handled this category to register myself.

After I registered , I was told our team will be composed of sewist and of models. The sewists has to sew 3 outfits based on 3 different themes (Diversity , the color of the campus , free theme). I was happy with it

The issue began when I got added to our team's group. The whole team was composed of 4 people. Turns out , I am THE ONLY ONE able to actually sew clothes.
 Even worse , 2 of the 3 models are men. And since I never sewed for men before it's going to be even more complicated  for me (I really suck at making pants , I'm more of a skirt girl)

The issue here is that I don't have time to sew 3 whole outfits , which  2 would be for men (Which would take even more time due to my incompetence in men's clothing). I'm not fast enough for this.
Beside , I highly suspect that since I'm sewing , I will be the one paying for the materials (Fabric , Dye , needles , thread , other stuff) and it's not cheap at all !

The organisator of the group said that the other members will help me. But honestly , I can't see them helping going well considering they never sewed a thing in their lives (Like , how are they supposed to help me ?)

I did told the organisator all of this but wasn't given a solution or even a real answer 

So basically , I consider quitting. The tournament is in a month. I know that if I leave they will most likely have to renounce competing in this section.
But honestly , I don't know how am I supposed to make this work 

Would I be the Asshole If I decide to quit ?

Im 19, Female

I moved to my 3 friends family and well...lets say im not really having any problems with my friends mom and understand her moms side...

Okay well some informations about my friend...
She is right now 17 but a huge trouble maker...like getting pregnant at 14, drug use, stealing, skipping school and respectless...she doesnt really get along with her mother since her mother sets her limits and well her mother also has addictions so money is always short and the youngest children there for get favored before the older once.

Her mother might not be perfect but she has her reasons and even if she is a complicated character she tries to be a bit better like trying to become clean and all but the family isnt really helping and only laughs at her and saying she aint gonna make it and ended up back into bad habbits. Despite that cant I blame her and she still tries to do things but no one really appreciates it...like on eastern it only gave enough to buy a bit of choclate for the little once but she spread it out that even we older once got some in a easter search but first thing her kids asked was where the money is...I felt so bad for her and got a little something for her too.

I there for have a better relationship with her but now my friend is mad at me for it and asks me what is all this about and that she finds me impossible for beeing on good foot with her mother and now hates me for every possible reason like 'not having thanked her for allowing me to stay with her family' or giving the other two friends in the family stuff since I knew them longer and owned them more, while I already gave her gifts for not cheap prizes thoughtful gifts and even got her out of jail once having now 2K depts...",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,0.022039274,0,1
121,1c6yuc9,"AITA for getting upset when a ""family day"" was entirely centered around my sister?","Im(16f) on my phone so bad formatting and english isnt my first language, please excuse that <3. Around last week, my parents asked me if I wanted to go on a ""family trip"" to the mall with my parents and sister(10f). 
For context, it was spring break and they had asked me what I wanted to do- to which I had said a trip to the Cafe in the mall would be nice, and they agreed.

I assumed that was why we were going. I agreed and went with them.
I was most definitely wrong about what we were doing, and spent most of my day just following my sister around as she went to get new clothes ect. She stopped for food at some point (parents paid for it, if that's relevant) and I asked if I could get some food too. They said no, and I suggested I could pay for it myself- they said no again, and moved onto the next thing once she got her food.

They basically wouldn't let me get anything to drink either, even if I paid for it myself, so it was a very long 4 and a half hours of my day.
When we got home, they asked me if I had fun and I replied that ""I wouldn't have come if I knew I was just going to be following my sister around all day."", to which they got mad at me, saying that it was an effort to spend more time with my family. I'm not really sure if I should've said that, as my sister heard and got upset about it, so I'd really appreciate peoples opinion on whether or not I'm in the wrong for saying what I did.

122,1c6y9vk,AITA for calling out my “friend” for his behavior with his girlfriend?,"I (21 F) had a friend group of people I met in university since two years ago. We hung out a lot and I developed a bond with all of them. One of these “friends”, let’s call him Jay, 5 months ago got in a relationship. Since his gf, lets call her Tina, is in the same university she started hanging out with us often. 

I started noticing some things about his behavior towards her that I didn’t like. He would make some sneaky backhanded “compliments” about her, statements that belittled her intelligence and competence and he would sabotage her hanging out with her other friends like insisting that the place they were about to go was “dangeorus” or “shi**y” and that she should stay at home instead. Jay would act nice and friendly to us but he reserved all his mean side to Tina. This behaviors were small and rare at the start and gradually got worse and more frequent as the weeks went by.

This culminated when one time I overheard Jay talking to the phone with Tina and telling her that, quote, “You shouldnt have stopped to take a coffee with your  girl friend because you were supposed to be home”. That was my last straw and I decided to confront him.

I told Jay that his behavior was unaccetable, that he was controlling and that his girlfriend didn’t deserve to be treated like that. He talked to me in a tone that I never heard from him and told me “to mind my business”. I told Jay that him abusing a girl WAS my business and he yelled at me and we continued to yell at eachother until I said that I had enough and I didn’t want to have anything to do with him. 

My other uni friends told me that I should have minded my business and that he can do whatever he wants in his relationship and since I didn’t want to apologise to Jay they cut me off. 

His girlfriend told me that she knew he was treating her badly but it was because recently he was “nervous” and stated that she loved him (this is the saddest part imo). My other friends (my closest ones) and my mom told me that I was right to call him out like that.

The wedding is costing quite a bit and to have all the kids in the family there it's going to cost an extra $1,500. 

We've made allowances for babies coming overseas as there will be no sitter available. We have also made an allowance for my brother's newborn as he is breastfed.

For my brother, this is not enough. He wants both his kids there. (even though none of the kids on my fiance's side are going)

124,1c6xy7v,AITA for telling my mom I'll never let her husband adopt me and she needs to get over it?,"My parents broke up when my mom was pregnant with me. My dad was in the military when I was little and when I was 5 he came home all fucked up from what he had seen and he was never the same again. He ended up doing drugs because medications and therapy weren't helping him and he was doing really badly. I'd see him cry a lot and hold his head and I know he had flashbacks and relived stuff while I was there. But I never felt unsafe. Just really sad that my dad was hurting. My mom ended up suing for full custody and got more custody of me but I still got to see my dad every other weekend. Mom hated it and tried to fight that but the court appointed therapist I should still have every other weekend with dad.

Mom got married to Dan when I was 9. After they got married the two of them sat me down and asked me how I'd like Dan to be my dad legally, and we could be a family, all three of us. I told them I already had a dad and I didn't want another one. We went back to court and I found out while speaking to the judge that it was because mom had tried to sever dad's parental rights and put in a petition for Dan to adopt me. The judge asked me how I felt about it and I got so scared that he would do it and I begged him not to and I said I didn't want Dan to be my dad and I didn't want to lose my dad. The judge listened and denied the adoption request.

Mom and Dan still fight against me seeing dad. Mom has taken my phone from me a few times because dad and I would text during the week. When I was 12 mom told me dad had picked drugs over me and I have Dan now who would never do that to me. She told me he would be a much better father. I told her Dan wasn't my dad and no matter how much she hates dad or thinks he's terrible, I disagree and I love him and Dan will never be able to compete with that.

Dan has asked me himself a few times to let him adopt me. He told me he loves me and wants so badly to be able to look after me. He told me if anything happened to mom he would hate to see me live with dad and be taking care of him. I told him I would rather be with my dad than stay with him, someone who isn't my dad. He got mad a couple of times and a couple of other times he told me I was showing how young I was. I'm 15 now btw.

So my mom decided to approach dad and ask him to willingly give up his rights so Dan can adopt me and she would let him call me once a week and see me once every two months. Dad said no and mom cursed him out. I waited until she was done and I told her I'll never let her husband adopt me and she needs to get over it. She told me she cannot understand me dismissing a good man who loves me and would do anything for me for a man who can't get off drugs for me. I told her Dan doesn't have to live with the demons my dad does. She told me I'll regret my decision in the future and I'm being stubborn for no reason.

125,1c6wz8j,AITA for not wanting my friend to go out with us?,"i (20F) and my friends are all in university. our finals are coming to an end and we all want to celebrate by going clubbing one last time before most of us leave town for summer. we’ve decided on the date and there’s 8 of us planning to go. all 8 of us are of legal drinking age and therefore can enter whatever club we wish. two of the girls (i’ll call them sylvia and ivory, both 20 years old) live together and i’m over at their house all the time as they live right by campus. there’s also a third girl that lives there and all four of us are very close friends. this third girl, let’s call her chloe, is 18 (below drinking age). she wasn’t planning on coming out with us but a couple hours ago, sylvia announced in our 4-girl groupchat that chloe wants to come with us.
 
this is a problem for a handful of reasons: 

1. there’s only one club that will allow chloe in and we’ve been there so often that we’re pretty much sick of it (the crowd sucks because it’s just underage girls and overage men). 

2. this is THE clubbing night. if it was just us four, i would be okay with going. but there are girls coming with us who will have their first clubbing experience with us and i want to make sure they have a fun time. not only that, two of them (gina and jaclyn) are coming from hours away just for this night. 

3. my best friend (gina) will be joining us and she works crazy hours and this is pretty much the one night off she has and she’s also against going to that one club. she and one of the other girls joining us, jaclyn, used to live together in another province and jaclyn has taken time off to visit gina. jaclyn’s flight lands the morning of club day and neither gina or nor i want her going through all of this trouble just for a mediocre night because of one person. 

4. we were originally planning on club hopping as is tradition on our nights out. the only time we stick to one club is when chloe joins and it’s always been with a small group. club hopping, we’ve found, always ends up as a fun night. we can’t do that with chloe tagging along. 

here’s where i think i’m the asshole: chloe and i are very close friends. i sit on her lap and do her makeup when she wants to wear it. in fact, i bought about 95% of the makeup she has. she borrows my jewelry. she’s accompanied me to therapy. she bought me a concert ticket to burna boy to accompany her because i mentioned that i’m a fan. she’s never had any intention of expecting me to pay her back, especially because i’ve been having a hard time financially. we go to each others’ lectures together. we’re probably gonna spend a lot of time over the summer together too as she’s staying for half of it and i live in the city. i don’t want to hurt her by excluding her from our night and i really wish she could join but my only problem is that she’s too young and will hold us back from an actual fun night out. 

i responded to the groupchat telling them that i do not want to be restricted to that one club and they just said “then don’t come”. what i didn’t respond is that i’m not the only one who doesn’t want to go to that club. i think more than half of our group is against it. if chloe comes, i know at least 4 people who will cancel because we’ve all been looking forward to club hopping.

During spring break my wife took her two girls to a major city near us for a ""Mommy/daughter day."" They ate, went to a spa, etc.

While she was gone I took my kids and her son out for bowling and mini golf. After her trip with her girls was over, the next day, she took her son out for a ""Mother/son day"" where she took him out to see whatever movie he wanted.

She and I have been arguing ever since about how she excluded my daughter from her ""Mommy/daughter"" day. I think it was cruel. My daughter grew up without a mother and I know it would have meant a lot to her to be included.

Hey everyone! Just had a question, because I’m still surprised this even happened to me. 
For context I’m a teacher at an elementary school. 
I do work inside of a neighborhood, but we do share the same area with a middle school and a busy park. We are also 1/4 mile from a busy street. 

I park off campus to wanting to avoid door dings and I’ve already been hit and run by someone at the park across the street. 
I park next to another school and across from homes in the area. My car was bought new and I just want to keep it in the best shape possible. 
I don’t drive obnoxiously around in my car, especially around work. I do have an exhaust on, but I definitely don’t think it’s the loudest car around. 

I don’t keep my revs high to make my car loud or rev my car. 

[Exhaust here](https://youtu.be/ZOnvf0Qc9sQ?si=NEa0WoSrOpM5TS-J)

Today when I was returning from lunch, I had a neighbor waiting for me. Then approach and tell me my car is too loud and that I am waking his kid from their nap. 
In the moment I was trying to professional because there is a huge chance this kid and parents attend my school later on. So I try to say okay, but I was definitely confused to hear my car was too loud. 
Dude asked me park somewhere on specific days. I just said okay and left back to work. I’m planning on just avoiding the issue, but I’m definitely confused, at the same time don’t really give a crap. 
Am I an asshole? lol 

 I’m willing to be wrong lol 
Appreciate it yall! 

Also no kids for me but I do understand the difficulty of kids. But still not entirely sure it was warranted.

Throughout our friendship she has had sexual relations with several men who are either married or in committed relationships, as well as had other relationships with men who did not respect her or treat her correctly. I always have supported her despite strongly disagreeing with her actions as the other woman, and finding it morally reprehensible. I have questioned her about her role but never voiced my opinion. 

Recently, she had started dating a male coworker of hers who is an alcoholic with a bad track record of dating other coworkers and having toxic relationships. He and my best friend were engaged and set to be married within 2 months, and got matching tattoos. I supported them though I thought it was risky because he seemed to treat her well. A few days ago, my friend found out that he was texting his ex girlfriend saying he loved her and left him and cancelled the engagement. The ex girlfriend was then back over his house later that night. He went on a binge drinking episode after my best friend left. My best friend voiced that she wants to change and respect herself, and at this time admitted she had hooked up with a third married man just prior to getting engaged. 

Today, I learned that she took him back. I voiced that I didn’t agree with her being with him and that it was hard for me to be her friend if we have nothing in common because she has made such bad moral and personal decisions recently. She said she needs a break because I made her feel like a loser and real friends wouldn’t do that. I didn’t call her any names, just explained my opinion on her recent behaviors over the span of our friendships for the first time. I even explained that I love her and want her to do better because she deserves better. Lately, I have been having trouble respecting her and I talk badly about her decisions so often to my boyfriend that it almost makes me feel like a bad friend. And what does it say about me to keep someone like that in my close circle…..

130,1c6vw02,AITA for not attending a family dinner,"My wife's grandmother passed away in 2021. Every year since then, the week of her birthday, my wife, her mother and aunt go out to dinner together to celebrate her life. 

In the 10+ years of our relationship, I can count on two hands the number of my interactions with her grandmother. We had a language barrier, and her grandmother was in severe cognitive and physical decline throughout. I have good relations with my wife's whole family, but never had any type of relationship with her grandmother. 

A few days ago, my wife asked if it would be ok if she cooked a dinner at our house instead of going out to a restaurant. I said ok. Fast forward to today: I decided while they were having dinner, it would be a good opportunity for me to go out and connect with my close friends on my own. I have admittedly struggled to initiate contact with many of them and have not been proactive in maintaining relationships. My therapist has previously advised me of the importance of this given my history of mental health issues and my isolation habits. My wife (also a therapist) has also called me out on this many times before and encouraged me to be more proactive. 

I mentioned my intentions about this to my wife today. It turns out that we had a miscommunication. She intended to have entire family, including her father and her aunts husband, all come over for this dinner. This was never clearly communicated to me, nor was the expectation that I would be there as well (she did acknowledge that). 

I told her i still intended to go out. This turned into a big fight. My wife has never been expected by me or any member of my family to be involved in any of the funerals, celebrations of life, or any other family matters of this nature on my side. Hell, when I went to see my grandmother for the last time before she passed away (without my wife attending or being expected to attend), my wife refused to even pick me up from the airport.

I pointed out what I perceive to be the hypocrisy of the situation. That I am being expected to live up to an expectation that was never communicated to me, an expectation that has never been asked of her, and the fact that my desire to make good on a change that my wife herself encouraged me to make being suddenly so problematic because of these expectations that were never communicated.

131,1c6vmwf,AITA for being upset how my bachelorette party went? ,"I(27) am getting married this year. When my aunt told me her and my mom were throwing me a Bach party, I was shocked. My mom and I aren’t close so I assumed maybe I was getting one because my aunt asked my mom about it and my mom figured it was best to throw one to save face and not come off as a bad mom to outsiders. So they planned one for me and said it was going to be a surprise. 

I don’t like surprises. I have said this to my mom many times growing up. But I trusted them because I thought they were trying to recreate a moment when I was little when they both surprised my bro and I by taking us to Disney world. I figured it made sense. I’m going on a Disney cruise for the honeymoon and fiancé and I went to Disney on ice a couple months ago. It wasn’t Disney. I managed to figure out that it was New Orleans. 

I cried and confronted my mom. I told her how I did not feel comfortable with this place at all. I do not drink and I’m extremely shy and introverted. I even found out my aunt had invited friends of hers to the trip. Strangers I did not know or feel comfortable around who were not invited to the wedding. I told her how hurt I was and how I felt like I was going to be an afterthought at my own party that was meant to honor me. She screamed at me calling me ungrateful and spoiled and even threatened to leave me in debt for the wedding. 

Throughout the trip, what I predicted happened. Aunt even confessed that mom left all the planning to her. So my mom didn’t help a single bit with the party planning. I felt unimportant, unloved, and felt utterly disrespected. My boundaries were ignored and my beliefs mocked by people who claimed to love me so. Maid of honor thankfully came along on the trip and was the only one who protected and cared about my feelings during the trip. 

Now that the trip is over, aunt is pissed to the point where has told me she refuses to help with planning my bridal shower and she even told me it was best to consider replacing my young cousins who were in the bridal party. 

My heart aches. I just wanted them to plan a party around things that I actually like and feel comfortable with. And with no strangers involved. They’re both punishing me for how I feel. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,0.044626173,0,1
132,1c6vi5q,WIBTA for not letting my brother in law hitch a ride?,"
My wife (35f) and I (32m) currently live in SoCal and have considered moving to Vegas in the long term due to the lower cost of housing. We've both been there before as tourists (neither of us are big on casinos), but for a year we've talked about going for a weekend trip to look at houses and get the vibe on specific neighborhoods we might consider in the future.

Flash forward to now: we finally found a weekend do this trip, just for one night.  It's a 6 hour drive, and we plan to leave pretty early in the morning on a Saturday. My wife mentioned this to her mom. The same day, my brother-in-law (40m) texted my wife 3 times asking to hitch a ride with us.  She thought he was joking at first and just replied with a laugh emoji. Brother-in-law said he felt ""excluded,"" but promised if we take him along he would get his own hotel and not spend time with us while we're there. He also asked my wife why she can go ""have fun"" on trips like this while he can't.

When my wife first told me about his request, I said no, absolutely not. My brother-in-law is unemployed, has no prospects or motivation to work, and always hits up his little brother for money. I know he can't afford to go to Vegas on his own. Now my in-laws are saying it's rude not to bring him along.

133,1c6v4no,AITA for trying to be a good friend?,"Gina was a notorious liar, snitch, and gossip. Despite this she still managed to win the hearts of the whole grade. During our time as friends, she lied to me, spread rumors about me, and outed me to nearly half my friend group.

Robin was my friend. He was the quiet kid, and most people liked him. For a long time he was my emergency contact, and I had his back like no one else.

When Gina started spreading rumors about Robin, I tried to stay quiet, however after a while my conscience wouldn't let me for any longer. 

I texted Robin, and I quote, ""Hey you can't tell anyone I told you this but Regina has been going around telling people that you liked Harper and I haven't and won't say anything I just thought you should know."" Harper is years younger than him

Moments later, Gina starts blowing up my phone, showing screenshots of me and Robin's conversation that apparently he sent her, and saying, very politely, I'll give her that, that we couldn't be friends anymore.

I instantly knew I needed to talk to Robin, but he didn't think there was anything that needed to be discussed, and he sent his friend Walt, who's always the mediator, tbh, to talk to me instead. 

Here's where I was probably the asshole. I was in tears by the time Walt came to talk to me, and I tried to explain the story to him, and I may have snapped at him once or twice. Two of the girls in my grade came over to ask what was wrong, and I snapped at them too.

One of my most trusted friends overheard and confronted Robin. She then reported back to me that he didn't care how I felt. I blew up and made some very passive aggressive remarks.

134,1c6v4c9,AITA for “demanding” I get the bigger room?,"I (20F), am I sophomore at a university in Freshman year, I lived with a roommate on campus lets call her Liz (20F). Me and Liz met through Instagram and we seemed to have similar interests and living habits. We didn’t know anyone going to our school, so we decided to be roommates. Our 1st year went great, we were good roommates, and became good friends. She was definitely a little spoiled and was always used to getting her way, but there were never any major problems with us.  

The issue comes with her cat. I am allergic to cats, and Liz didn’t have her cat with her our freshman year. When it was time to choose housing for our 2nd year (our school 2 years of on campus living), Liz registered the cat as an emotional support animal. We wanted to room together again, but she insisted on bringing her cat. We chose a room setup where it is two rooms connected by a shared bathroom, and did not live in the same The cat did not come into my room often, and just stayed in her room and this year I’ve been pretty much ok and don’t have allergies in my own room.
 
Now we’re looking for a house off campus together, and we found a 3bd house that we are going to rent with our friend Jack (21M). Liz is planning on bringing her cat. The house has a weird layout. When you walk in through the front door into the living room, on the right, there is a kitchen, and 1 bedroom with an attached bathroom. If you go left from the living room, there are 2 bedrooms directly one after the other (shotgun style), the first one smaller and the 2nd larger.  The larger bedroom also has its own private entrance from the yard. 

We needed to sign our lease asap, and I told Liz that I would pay more in rent for having the back larger bedroom. This is due to the fact that if I were to get the smaller room, her cat would be constantly going in and out of my room, be on my bed, and I would have allergies, while if I got the larger room, I would always keep the door closed. I know that I might have allergies in the living room and stuff, I just absolutely don’t want to have potential allergies in my own bedroom. Again, I offered to pay more of the rent for this room. I fully do not care about the size of the rooms (I’ve lived in an NYC apartment my whole life, and have had relatively small bedroom with a twin bed), I only care about not having allergies in my own bedroom. The rooms are also not hugely different in size, and they’re both spacious. 

Liz threw a tantrum when I said this. She yelled at me as to why I “automatically get that room”, and that she wants the bigger room, that this wasn’t fair, etc. She called me a bunch of names, saying it was bullsh*t that I got a bigger room etc.  As an alternative, I said I  could take the bedroom with the attached bathroom, but she said that she refuses to share a bathroom with Jack. I got so fed up, I told her my medical issues were more important than her getting a larger room. This was 2 days ago, and she’s still mad at me. AITA?

135,1c6v1l4,AITA for being upset that I’m not invited to a private convo,"We both play the same fps game. His “boys” request him to go into discord on the mic so all I can hear is my boyfriend talking a lot and nothing else, and a lot of this game requires cooperation so for me not to hear the other player involves me kinda on the side line and not doing my best. First he invited me when I said I can’t hear anyone, then I tried to ask for him to send me the invite link and changed his mind and basically said that he didn’t know why he invited me actually. 

He says “it’s a private discord” and I said well I probably wouldn’t even talk that much it’s just annoying hearing him have one side of a convo on his mic next to me and more ridiculous if we are playing the same exact game with the same people. I got so upset I said ok I’ll just play my own game with randoms. He said ok. Didn’t care.

But I STILL hear him on the mic near me yapping away and I have no context and honestly I learned all the games he plays so that I could be more involved. It just sucks and I feel excluded. I just start to dread when he puts his headphones on now cause I know it’s about to get loud and I’m about to be excluded.

137,1c6ubee,AITA for asking to be included on my boyfriend’s housewarming invitation? ,"I need to know if I’m out of line for this. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for over 2 years. Recently he bought a home, a complete fixer upper. It’s his home only, I’m not on the title. We live together currently (we have been for over a year). We’ll be moving into his house once it’s complete. 

While I haven’t been helping too much with the renovations (I don’t have much expertise in it) I have taken on all of our household duties. I cook, clean, buy all of our groceries. While he works on his house. 

My bf hasn’t included me in much of the decision making on his new home. He’s picking out everything and has given me no creative freedom in renovations- he says I can decorate when it is done. 

I at first was hurt about this, but ultimately I accepted it is his home and it’s not my place to have an opinion. We’re moving in in a few weeks and he has plans to throw a housewarming. He’s not including my name on the invites. 

Basically, when he talks about the house, he only ever talks about how he’s moving in and he gets to do this. I could be standing right next to him, and he still will only talk about himself. I end up feeling left out and like I don’t exist. He wants a housewarming for him only, and as much as I don’t want that to hurt, it does. I’m moving in too, but somehow I feel like I don’t have a home and I belong no where. 

Even his family only ever talks to him about the house, even while I’m sitting right there. I feel so awkward, like I’m just not involved in this as well. I feel bad that I haven’t helped more on the home, but I work full time and I have taken on all household duties. He never has to worry about anything at home now. They offered to get him a housewarming gift, didn’t include me whatsoever. They just told him it’s up to him only, right in front of my face. 

I got upset with him tonight about it and he told me that it is his home and he did most of the work, so I just need to be happy for him.

139,1c6tax4,AITA for excessive pacing and not walking with parents?,"I (late teens F) really like to pace around in circles listening to music, to almost an excess degree. I sometimes go an hour or 2 of just walking in a circle fiddling with something and with headphones on. It’s so frequent that a whole pathway formed from me walking the same path in my backyard.

I personally think this habit isn’t too bad, it’s just walking around and it relaxes me, but my parents won’t stop smack talking me about it and are getting annoyed that i won’t walk with them.

I would love to leave the house and go on walks but ALONE, and I think i’m capable of doing so but my parents think otherwise. Walking with my parents just feels a little restrictive & demeaning since it consists of them forcing me to talk to them and being a bit too self centred/mean ( you know those friends that make mean ‘jokes’ about you, that’s what my parents are like 🥲).

And now they’re saying that I’m TA for this pacing behaviour, they’re saying that they have to ‘tolerate’ with, and not going on spontaneous walks with them?

141,1c6t2j8,AITA for telling my mother that I find it disgusting that my younger brother doesn’t flush the toilet?,"I’m 21 and my brother is 11, we live with my mother and my step father (my brother’s dad). This is a gonna be a little graphic so I recommend you stop reading if you have a weak stomach.  Anyway quite often I will go into the toilet sometime after my brother has taken a dump and sometimes he flushes but doesn’t clean up any mess left over. Sometimes he doesn’t flush at all. I’ve also noticed there’s never any toilet paper in the toilet when he doesn’t flush, and can sometimes smell that he clearly needed to use some when he walks past. He also never, ever washes his hands. 

I know he’s not my child but I find this disgusting. I’ve mentioned that he never washes his hands after using the toilet and I find it gross to my mother before but she said that I’m not perfect so I shouldn’t judge him for it and to mind my own business. Anyway fast forward to now and at about 12:30am last night everybody had gone to bed apart from me. I was sat in the living room about to eat some food I’d made, when my brother came downstairs. He went into the toilet, it sounded like he didn’t even close the door, and then came back in through the living room and went straight back to bed a few minutes later. 

When he walked through, I noticed he absolutely stank, as well as that I didn’t hear a toilet flush. He’d gone back to bed before I could say something and my mother would go mental at me if he told them that I had told him off anyway. I walked through to the toilet and apart from the smell that was way worse than usual that made me gag and almost vomit, I also saw runny shit filling the toilet as well as some on the seat. Oh and no toilet paper with it hence why he stank when he walked past I’m sure. 

It was absolutely vile and I cleaned it all up as it would be gross not to and as I was the last one up I know I’d get the blame for it. Next day I tell my mother what happened and that this needs to stop. He needs to learn to flush the toilet, clean up after himself and wash his hands as he’s 11 not 3. She went mad, told me how dare I question her parenting skills, says I’m not perfect either (again), and that he’s a child so I shouldn’t hold him to the same standards as I do myself. She said I was being an asshole and could go live somewhere else if I don’t like it. 

The thing is, other than this he’s a very decent kid, and they’re happy to tell him off when he misbehaves and all that. They’re not bad parents generally but I just can’t understand this at all and it makes me wonder if im being unreasonable and im the asshole. So, AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,0.07890594,0,1

143,1c6snjp,"WIBTAH if I were to give out my kids sports schedules to family my parents don't like, even though I was asked not to?","For some context my(33F) parents have been divorced since I was about 8. Along with me, they also have my sister (27). Dad remarried when I was 11. And due to some circumstances, my stepmom was the one who helped raised my sister and i as her own for years. My sister will not even acknowledge our bio mom as her mother, and wants nothing to do with her. As she stopped going on visits to my mom's at 4 or 5, she has no memories of life with my mom. (I'd also like to note that when my sister stopped going on visits to my mom's, I was no longer allowed to go on visits either) My sister, only views ""stepmom"" as her one and only mom. 

I, on the other hand, was old enough to have good memories with Mom. And though I ended up not being able to contact her for years. I reached out to her when I left my dad's house at 18. And I have had a relationship with my mom ever since.

Now, my stepmom, I do see as a mom. I will call her that, she did help raise me and I love her very much. (Doesn't mean my mom isn't my mom and that I don't love her equally as much) 

But my stepmom has never liked my mom. She refuses to even be in the same building as her. And same for my sister. 

This, obviously, puts a strain on me, and, unfortunately, my children now. I fell we are made to pick and choose between our family that loves us! 

So, my kids play sports and obviously have school functions that family attends.... and I don't feel I can invite my mom because then my stepmom and sister won't go.

But everyone on both sides of my family know my kids are starting spring sports. And so I had a conversation with my dad and told him I was gonna give my mom the kids schedules and just wanted to give a heads up so they wouldn't be blind sided. Then a few days later, when I let my dad and stepmom know that I had written down and sent my sister the schedules I was asked if I had given it to my mom. I said not yet. And the response I got to that was ""well I really hope that you don't because then I won't go and neither will your sister or BIL"" 

I am usually a MASSIVE people pleaser but it is literally tearing me apart because I know my mom and her side of our family would love to be able to come. 

And I'm terrified if I speak out on it or go against their wishes, that I will lose what relationship I have with my dad, stepmom and sister. And that's not something I want. But I know this isn't fair to me, my kids, or my mom.

So, I wanna hear from the collective.....

144,1c6sivs,AITA for telling my sister to be nice to my gf and stop hanging out with my ex?,"I (26M) live with my sister (30F), her husband, and her 4 year old son. They bought the house and I rent out a room - they can’t afford the full mortgage until BIL gets his scheduled pay bump in the union. I dated my ex (25F) for the last 4 years, and we broke up 8 months ago due to her having a full-blown affair - possibly multiple guys, but I’m only positive about one.

A few months ago, I started dating my current girlfriend (24F). She’s really awesome - we both are into hiking and camping, and she’s just really cool to talk to about big ideas. However, she’s much more of an introvert, whereas my ex was kind of a modern day socialite (loved the city, very chic, came from money). My sister got along well with my ex but not so much my gf.

My sister actually goes out of her way to avoid my gf. When I have her over, she doesn’t greet or speak to her, but only talks to me and then leaves the room as quickly as possible. She won’t invite my girlfriend to anything (she invited my cousin, his gf, and me out for dinner with her and BIL). She makes little side comments about how gf is just a rebound and I’ll find my way back to my ex. She hangs out with my ex frequently and blasts it on social media. She makes fun of my girlfriend after she leaves for basically nothing - her ny accent, how she’s too quiet, how she cut her steak - literally everything.

Yesterday, my girlfriend cried on the way to her apartment. She said she knows my sister hates her and she always feels so stupid when she leaves, like she can never say the right thing. She asked if we can stay at her place from now on. I finally had enough of this and told my sister when I got home if she can’t cut the crap I’m moving out next month. She lost it on me and said I can’t dictate who she likes or doesn’t like, and that it’s my fault for not forgiving my ex since she “knows” my ex is my soulmate. Honestly, I think my sister just likes that my ex has connections and her grandfather’s money. AITA?

Edited to add: BIL unfortunately wouldn’t care about anything my sister is doing - they both tend to keep higher status friends and overlook moral qualms. He knows ex cheated and just told me that’s “rough” and then otherwise stayed out of it. I’m not sure if my sister knew she was cheating - they were close in the sense that we all did a lot together, but not like best friends (sister mostly just tries to tag along to networking events). I don’t think my sister would ever cheat on BIL - she cares more about meeting important people and trying to “level up” than about guys. Ex is currently dating one of the people she cheated with, but she apparently told my sister she wouldn’t mind “meeting up” with me sometimes, which my sister said I should go for.

145,1c6rmki,AITA for wanting an apology from my mom?,"I (25F) am currently on a work trip for a big event at the busiest time of the year for my job. This event just so happens to be close to my hometown. 
My mom(60F) and my dad(72M) asked to see me while I was here and I agreed to see them on the first two days because they were slower paced. 
Night one I met them for dinner and my mom begins to bring up wedding planning which was fine until it became all about what she wanted and everything I suggested was “too expensive” or “not feasible”. 
I’m very stressed with my job atm because of the time of year and event so that kind of threw me over the edge and I began to get emotional, there were tears. 
I explained how I needed to not talk about it and that we could talk at a later date. After dinner my dad suggested a drink in the hotel bar and I agreed hoping to end on a more positive note. My mom was silent the whole time. 
I finally asked her what was wrong and when she said nothing I called out her behavior and said I thought she would be okay with talking about things later because of my current stress level. She began to rehash the entire conversation about the wedding planning. 
I tried to summarize and make things better by saying I knew she was excited but I just needed some time before I could talk about it. She went silent again. 
I asked again what was bothering her and she started to tear up and say I made her feel like she failed me and that I “always have”. I asked her what she meant by that and she said that for years I have made her feel “less than”. 
I explained that I would never want to make her feel that way and I was sorry if I ever made her feel like a failure. She snapped at me and said “let’s make one thing clear, I am not a failure”. 
She went on and called herself a bad mom and brought up how I’ve always been unhappy and she’s never good enough for me. 
For context: I have talked to her in the past about experiences in my childhood that were rough for me(some that did surround her parenting style) and overtime I thought it had really repaired our relationship. My mom has a history of narcissistic tendencies and this argument is very similar to how most went in my childhood. 
I went quiet after everything she said and after a fair amount of silence we got up and I gave her a half hug goodbye and she stormed out of the lobby for “not hugging her”. For the rest of the night I could not shake the guilt around the idea of making someone feel this way for so long unknowingly. 
My parents and I met back up the next day per her request and she didn’t say much and when she did it was all small talk. I feel stuck, I’m not sure if I can move past this.

146,1c6ra8v,WIBTA for giving my roommate an ultimatum about his puppy,"I 20F live with my two roommates, 20F, Jamie and 21M, Caleb (fake names). Jamie and I have two adult dogs who have lived with us since we moved in to our place, and Caleb recently got a puppy. The issue is the puppy is now almost 6 months old and Caleb does not do anything to train the puppy. The puppy constantly uses the bathroom in the house and if Caleb is downstairs alone when it happens, he will act like he did not see it and leave it for someone else to clean up. The puppy also chews on shoes, the wall and any trash that is left around. I understand that this is all normal puppy behavior, the issue is that Caleb does nothing to correct it. And any time someone else tries to correct the behavior, Caleb always says “Leave him alone, he is just a puppy.” It’s also gotten to the point where if Jamie and I are not home for some reason and the puppy does something, Caleb will try to blame one of our dogs for what the puppy does. Our dogs have been potty trained for years and do not use the bathroom in the house, and very rarely will chew up any trash unless left completely unattended and there is something out. It’s gotten to the point where out whole house smells like dog pee and there is constantly chewed up trash all over the place, because Caleb refuses to clean up after his puppy and Jamie and I are tired of doing it. 

Jamie and I have been talking and decided that we no longer want to deal with the issues the puppy is creating. So my question is would I be the asshole if I told Caleb that he had a set amount of time to get the puppy trained or it needs to be rehomed, and if he is not willing to rehome the puppy, Jamie and I will move out. And if I would not be the asshole, what would be a good time frame to set for the training aspect.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-18,0.0,0.022885442,0,1
147,1c6r2d9,AITA for not going out of my way to tell my fathers child about doctors appointments after he has been nothing but disrespectful to me?,"AITA - I, 29F and my child’s dad, 32M, have a very tumultuous relationship. I had a beautiful boy with this man and he has done nothing but make me miserable throughout my pregnancy and even now. We have had custody battles and ultimately we are 50/50 but I’m primary. So I’m a single mom, working full time, and the sole provider for my child as he has not contributed much since he was born. We have had communication issues, naturally, but I try and keep him in the loop about important things like how he’s doing in school, his health, etc. I usually tell him when doctors appointments are and most of the time he either doesn’t respond or just doesn’t show up. A month ago he actually showed up to one of the appointments where the doctor stated that due to our son not speaking as many words as he should she was going to refer him to a speech therapist. She did a month ago and I made the appointment which was recently. I did not tell him when the appointment was because 1. He did not ask for a whole month about it or follow up and 2. I had other things on my mind I didn’t really think to message him to tell him about an important appointment for his child that he did not express interest in. I messaged him the day of the appointment to let him know of the findings in which he proceeded to become angry with me. Stating that I’m withholding important information from him, I don’t want to involve him in his health and safety, I’m hiding things from him, and that I pretty much want total control over our sons care. I then made him aware that I am only responsible for our son and our son only, I’m not there to make him responsible for his son. 

He did not message once to follow up on the appointment and most of the time doesn’t show up to these said appointments, so why is he so mad now!? I have put effort in to co-parenting with much resistance and this is just another added thing. I feel like as a father, who attended the doctors visit, he should’ve been proactive in finding out and following up to see if these important appointments were made.

148,1c6qqpt,AITA for not allowing treats to be brought in by my Ex-Partner for our son unless there are treats for my daughter too?,"I (34F) am a single mother to two children, (10F) and (6M), they have different fathers with my daughter being the child of my late husband who died when she was two years old, I fully admit that I was not ready for a new relationship when I met the father of my son and it's what led to our relationship falling apart though we tried to make it work.

My Ex-Partner (37M) and I have been separated for two years, it was rough in the early days of our separation but for the most part things are fine now except for an issue i've had recently. Lately every visit my ex-partner will bring our son treats; be it a McDonalds Happy Meal, some crisps and juice, a pastry, basically anything junk food related as a treat because i'm usually quite strict about the children getting those regularly. This wouldn't be an issue except for the fact it's only our son who gets these treats and my daughter has to see the man who was a major part of her life for so long all but ignore her now.

I've spoken to my ex-partner and made it clear that unless he brings treats for my daughter too he can't bring any treats for our son into the House. What he does when he takes him out is between them but this isn't fair to do in front of her, I also made it clear I don't expect him to spend his own money on her as at the end of the day she isn't his child, but just to text me before he arrives to let me know what he's bringing so I can send him money to get her the same, I really don't care that she'd think they're from him I just hate her feeling ignored.

He thinks i'm being ridiculous and should just buy her treats myself if I want to do that, that she isn't entitled to get the same things as our son and this would only hurt our son. That isn't the point and I feel like he's missing it. I don't think i'm in the wrong here, all he has to do is pretend to be the one giving it to her and it feels cruel to me that he won't even go along with that.

149,1c6qq1f,"AITA for defending my dads ""toxic masculinity""","I (21m) was talking to a friend (20f) and we were talking about how she was sick because something was getting passed around at her work, that she's had for a while. She was talking about how I somehow ""never"" got sick and I said well yeah I was a weird kid might have helped my immune system or something. 

Then I said oh i remember whenever I did get sick as a kid my mom would do this thing where she got a bunch of boiling water in a pot, put some tea bags in it then shed put it on the table and I'd kneel on a chair over it, with a towel over my head so the steam was trapped and it'd clear up my nose. The tea was propabally just tradition or something the main thing was the boiling water and steam, might help you. She asked if that felt wierd, and I said yeah, it gets ur face all wrinkly and sweaty  and after a little it gets hard to breathe but it rlly helps at the end of the day.

I then joked about how my dad would always try to challenge me to get me to do it longer for more effect, where he'd basically call me a bitch or like a pussy or a little girl  (rough translation from our language, but it could be like any of those things) and as a kid I'd always fall for it and go for longer.  She said that's horrible. I said what do you mean, he was just trying to get me to go for longer to help me. And it was always playful. She said something like that can't be playful. I said he said that to challenge me because without a challenge I'd chicken out pretty fast so there was like no effect, it helped me. She said that that was a toxic masculine behavior. I said well it was literally just to challenge me for my own good, besides that's like a rough translation it's just like a ruder way to say coward. She said my dad calling me that was just toxic, and I shouldn't be defending it I said she really needed to stop talking about things she had no idea about.

150,1c6qewi,AITA for refusing to dance at the Stag Night for my Boyfriends brother?,"I (25F) am a stripper and it's a job I am not ashamed of and enjoy a lot, plus it makes great money. My Boyfriend (27M) of four years asked me tonight if i'd dance for his brothers Stag Night this Saturday (It's what a Batchelor Party is called in my country, and the female version is called a Hen Night) the dancer they originally had booked that I helped arrange had to cancel as she broke her ankle during a performance. 

I've tried to find them another Dancer calling in favours from my friends in the industry but weekends are always busy and it's too short notice so everyone is booked solid. I offered to get them into the club I work for and would even be able to arrange for VIP treatment of the party but this offer was rejected as the club is too far away from other activities they have planned for the evening. 

In the end my Boyfriend suggested I dance, he has no problem with my job and didn't feel like me dancing for the group would be a problem. Now, if it was my boyfriends friends i'd be open to it after discussion to make sure we were both fully ok with this but the fact it's for his brother raises concerns for me and feels just too awkward.

My Boyfriend refuses to see the issue stating we're all adults and his brother was looking forward to there being a stripper at the party, but it's just weird to think if we work out then for the rest of my life i'll have to know his brother saw me dance and at every family event I attend it'll just be on my mind. 

I've told my Boyfriend it isn't happening and the best I can offer is the club, and if they need a stripper that badly then they'll take it. He thinks i'm being ridiculous and that someone in my job shouldn't be bothered by this and if they can be mature about it so should I.

152,1c6q81u,WIBTA for taking back my D&D module while my former DM is running the campaign for a different party?,"For full context, I bought a few Dungeons & Dragons books on sale a few months back with my two buddies Colton and Marshall. Not their real names by the way, as I'd like to remain as anonymous as possible. 

Colton isn't exactly well to do, so it's rare for him to buy much if anything for our group. Because of this, it usually falls to Marshall and I to buy stuff whenever we go out or do stuff. This is something we're both fine with and neither of us hold it against him. 

Anyways, while we were picking out what books to get Colton was adamant about getting one in particular. Again for the sake of anonymity I'm going to omit which specific book it was, but it was a campaign module. Bare in mind, even getting it on sale doesn't exactly mean it was cheap and I definitely walked out of the store with less money than I'd hoped.

Another detail about Colton is that he's a bit of an addict when it comes to D&D, and he's in far more campaigns at any one given time than any sane person should be. Because of this, it's not uncommon for him to run multiple campaigns at the same time with the same module, and this is something he was doing with the module I had bought for our group.

When the time came to actually play this module I had bought, Marshall didn't end up joining the party which was definitely a bit of a bummer for me. I ended up joining a different group that Colton is a part of for this module, which isn't something I was expecting but nothing I was against. 

These people ended up actually being really cool and I was enjoying the campaign a lot. Unfortunately we only ended up doing about six sessions before two of the players dropped out, and since there were no longer enough people for this party the campaign wound up cancelled.

I get that this isn't Colton's fault and I don't blame him in any way for it turning out like this, but remember how I mentioned he was running multiple campaigns with this module? I can't help but be salty I ended up paying a not insignificant amount of money for a campaign module just for him to run the module for a group I'm not even in.

What makes this worse is the fact that this isn't even the first time something like this has happened with Colton. Last year, Marshall ended up buying a different module Colton was practically begging for for us to go through, and we only got through a handful of sessions before it ended up getting cancelled. Then later, Colton set up a campaign with the module Marshall bought with a different group and didn't even invite him to join despite it Marshalls copy he was using.

I've known Colton for a long time, so I can say with confidence that I truly don't think it was his intention, but it feels like Colton took advantage of both Marshall and I. It may be petty, but I didn't buy that module for a group of people I don't even know to play through. I'm considering taking back my book so that I may just run it myself for Marshall and some of my family. Would I be the a-hole?",Asshole,2024-04-18,1.0,0.9608207,1,1
153,1c6q6jc,AITA When I ask my partner to let me know what they are ordering?,"Hello everyone. This is silly but it's a recurring argument so I wanted to get some unbiased opinions rather than asking my friends. Throwaway account because my partner knows my username.

&#x200B;

My partner and I both work long hours and neither of us are very interested in cooking, so we order take out more than the average couple. Most times we come to an agreement on something we'd both like, or if one of us is in the mood for something we suggest it to the other. Rarely, we even spin a wheel app if we can't decide.

 

However, there is one scenario that almost always starts an argument. If I have a strong preference, I suggest it and my partner either joins my order or decides to opt out and do something else. The identical scenario with the roles reversed is completely unacceptable to my partner. So, if I don't have a strong preference and I ask my partner to decide and let me know so I can potentially join in, it's a BIG PROBLEM. In my partner's words ""you didn't give me any input so you can't join my order"". To summarize, we can share an order only if I decide on my own, or if we decide together, but NOT if my partner decided the place. Money is NOT the issue - we always split costs equitably. You'll have to take my word for it obviously, but we are extremely fair regarding all things financial.

I find this absolutely baffling. It's an uncommon scenario in my household but it invariably results in an argument, and I really do want to understand. I have not been called an ""asshole"" specifically but the sentiment is clear.

155,1c6psnk,AITA for “defending my friend”,"Hi there, my netball team was a very close friendship, before two of my friends got into an argument and have since, stopped talking to each other. Since then, one of our friends has “taken sides” and stopped talking to the other. Me on the other hand, remain friends with both of them. 

It was the first netball training since the argument, and before I got there, my friend Lucy said hi to Jane and Anne (Jane and Lucy argued). The two girls ignored Lucy, and brushed past her. 

For the rest of the training, I talked to Jane and Anne, and also talked to Lucy but separately. A ball got accidentally thrown at Lucys head during game play, and Jane asked Lucy “Is your head ok” of which Lucy didn’t reply. We were in game play and I asked if she heard what Jane  said, lucy said she didn’t hear or even know that Jane was talking to her. 

Jane had an offended look on her face after that “incident”, so I told her that Lucy had said she didn’t hear what Jane had said, and she thought that jane wasn’t even talking to her so not to worry about it. 

Ever since then, for the rest of the night, Jane did not talk to me, and I heard Jane and Anne talking about how I had “picked sides” and “chosen Lucy” which is completely not true. 

I decided to message Jane at the end of the day, asking if she was upset over anything of which she replied that she was not upset, just disappointed on how things turned out. I replied saying I hope I didn’t disappoint her, and she opened my message but didn’t reply until the morning. Saying she was just sad and everything is fine. I’ve been messaging her all day but I feel as though she hasn’t been replying normally. 

I sent an apology for defending Lucy to Jane and she didn’t reply to that, so I moved to conversation to something else that was random and she’s Been replying dryly. 

I’m just confused over what I did wrong in the situation. As I was just trying to keep the peace and not have there be animosity in the team. I miss my friendship group and I feel like everything had fallen apart because I supposedly “chosen” Lucy. I have been feeling so anxious over this. Especially since Jane has now quit the team, I’m scared my friends (Lucy and  Anne) will not talk to me anymore and I won’t even have Jane to talk to at games and training since she quit. 

For context the argument between Lucy and Jane happened because Jane was offended about a joke that Lucy made to the group chat, Lucy is an international student from China and doesn’t understand some of the political and social context of our country and made an inventive joke. She apologised for it but Jane didn’t accept her apology. She doesn’t have to accept it, but I just feel sad that it feels like I can’t be friends with both of them for whatever reason.

This year is his first year playing on an advanced team as well as playing Rec ball. Now, the advance team he’s on is the park’s beginner advance team so they’re not the best, but nevertheless it’s advanced ball so I’m proud of him.

Anyways, my wife decided that it would be a good idea to go out and buy a $400 baseball bat because it’s what he wanted. Now I’d be totally okay with it if he could use the bat for both rec ball and advance ball, but that’s not the case. This bat is illegal in his rec ball league so he’ll only be using it for the next few months until advance ball is done and then it’ll just sit till next season. Also, there are 12 kids on his team and only 4 (now 5) bats that they can use which means other kids will be using this expensive bat and doing who knows what to it in the dugout. 

I’m upset because, 1. She didn’t discuss this with me. 2. The bat will only be used for 2 more months and then sit until next season so I really can’t justify spending $400 just because he wanted it.

Edit to add context:

1. We have a shared account and always discuss significant purchases before making them no matter the case.

A few days ago she asked her sister to go to the grocery shop with her and she said she can't because she has some leg pain.

So she asked me instead and I was like ""I don't feel like itttt"", and not in any disrespectful or shutting-down tone. I felt like she always asks for favours and I do them so I didn't want to say yes this time because I genuinely didn't want to leave the house.

She didn't go at the end, because she wanted someone to go with her and both me and her sister said no. Today, my mother told me that she said she's upset with me and that she didn't appreciate me not going with her.

Part of me feels bad because maybe I could've just pushed myself a bit to go with her, like it's not a big deal if I do go. But again I really didn't feel like it. If she had asked a third time or really insisted, I might've felt pressured to go but she didn't insist.

So am I the asshole for not going?

162,1c6p3ws,AITA For Not Wanting My Siblings at my Show?,"I (14f) have two younger siblings (8f and 10m) who do not know how to control themselves in public and cannot be quiet. I have always loved theatre, but I was too nervous to join because if your family caused constant interruptions, you wouldn’t be allowed in any future shows.

I know my siblings can’t be quiet, but for the last two years I’ve been very distant from my family. They don’t give me rides to school events, my mom doesn’t even live in the home, my father is always at work, and I actively go out of my way to avoid my family due to how often they pick fights with me and eachother. My siblings have a nanny, so they’re always with her.

It may sound like I’m being dramatic, but there was a three week period where I didn’t say anything to my family except “hello” “goodbye” “goodmorning” and “goodnight.” it was only broken by my father yelling at me over the cost of pads.

My family doesn’t attend anything for me, I’ve gotten used to it, they aren’t my family figuratively anymore, and quite frankly, I don’t really want them there at this point. The only thing they’ve ever done for me at my events is hold me back, cause problems, or complain about my friends, classmates, or teachers. It may seem weird that I defend my classmates and such so much, but they’re closer to my family than my real family. 

In fact, my old friend group all had family problems, some better than mine some worse, and we would pretend to be a family, which I only recently realized was us compensating so hard.

The only problem is now they want to come to my show. I would be okay with it being just my parents, I can stop just my parents from doing anything. But they want to bring my siblings.

My siblings cannot sit still until an intermission. They’ve gotten us kicked out of theaters, sporting events, and political events. They cannot be quiet.

If they come then I will surely not be able to participate in any highschool shows. I only joined this year because I was sure that my family wouldn’t want to come. They hate musicals, they don’t seem to care much about what I do, and they’ve never wanted to come to anything for me every before.

And then they overheard me talking to my friend about how I could finally do it since they wouldn’t be coming. They decided today, two days before the show, that they want to come and bring my siblings. I am doing everything in my power to get them blacklisted because I know they aren’t doing this for me and they’re only doing this to teach me a lesson about something stupid like “things dont always work out in our favor” and i will not be able to do anything in the theatre again if they ruin this for me.

But I feel like I’m being selfish. I don’t want my siblings to ruin this for me but I feel like I’m more or less ruining it for them. The fact that both of my parents agree that what I’m doing is assholery and that I’m stripping them of the right to see me perform doesn’t help either, but I’ve told them multiple times that my siblings CANNOT COME.

163,1c6ovvv,AITA for making my friend apologise to the hotel staff?,"I'm on holiday with a group of my friends and we have adjoining rooms. Friend A,B on one room and friend C, D and myself in the room next door.

On our second day, we went down for breakfast and came back to the room an hour later. Friend C starts panicking saying her bag and watch are missing.

We immediately all start searching the room. C starts checking her luggage, the safe, under the bed... no luck
 Our friends from the adjoining room also start searching in our room and theirs too.

- I remember seeing C with her bag on her bed before we left
- Friend A remembers seeing the watch on charge before we left
- None if us remember seeing Friend C with her bag at breakfast, so we were 90% sure she didn't leave it in the buffet.

In a huff, C storms out and says she's going to the reception. I do another sweep of the room while shes gone and happen to look under hrr pillow and there's her bag with her watch inside!

I quickly message her saying I found it. She obviously put it there for ""safety"" and forgot.

I thought she'd be happy a relieved... but no. In the time it took me to find the bag she had gone to reception and started accusing one of the hotel staff of entering the room n robbing her. She caused a real scene even demanding to see CCTV. The reception showed her the room logs (card card swipes are recorded) and nobody entered our room while we were at breakfast.

When she got upstairs, me not knowing what happened at reception, I happily handed her her bag and asked ""How did you forget you put it under your pillow? Why did you do that?""

She was huffing and puffing saying she was paranoid, because all the reviews about the country said to be wary of thieves and pick pocketed so she hid it. Then she explained what happened downstairs.

I was mortified. I told her to go downstairs and apologise to the staff if she hadn't done so already. She started getting all stroppy with me! She kept saying ""I just forgot!""

I reminded her ""you may have forgot where you put your bag but you just wrongly accused the staff for stealing! Go apologise!""

She stormed off downstairs and apologised, saying she found her bag BUT said it was in one of our bags which is why she couldn't find it. So she still covered her back.

She was in a mood with me all day so I must have made her feel like a child by making her apologise but, was I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-17,0.0,0.99044126,1,0
164,1c6orot,AITA for not wanting to reconcile with cousins?,"Recently, I fell out with my cousins for various reasons. The first time was due to constant disrespect to my boyfriend. We’ll call cousin 1 Vanessa. Vanessa invited me and my bf to her birthday party. Everything was fine up until me and my bf had a small disagreement through text. Vanessa saw the messages on his phone and pulled me aside to ask me about it. To this day, it wasn’t that serious. We were talking about my attitude when responding to his concerns. I told her and she immediately took my side and I guess she told the rest of the group and I noticed they started acting weird to him too. 

The whole time, they excluded him and would get visibly irritated whenever he would walk by me (who else was he supposed to walk by if no one will talk to him?!) and at dinner they made me feel uncomfortable because they were all sat on one side of the table and it was clear they were huddled together talking shit about him. It’s supposed to be a birthday celebration yet they’re being petty. They noticed that I looked upset and that’s when they asked me what was wrong and I called them out. They denied doing anything. I had enough at this point and I left early. We fell out afterwards and they didn’t take accountability for anything that happened and gaslit me. 

We reconciled a month later. Since then, it’s been little incidents that just bothered me about them until last August.

I was invited to a party one of the group members were having and I declined because I didn’t like parties (which they know) plus it was a lot of people I didn’t know. I declined and then the response was just a bunch of rude side remarks and then I was kicked out of the group chat. They tried lying to me saying I was the one that left but obviously, I know I didn’t. After that, all the messages to me were antagonizing me about not speaking to them so I ignored them. 

Then on thanksgiving, they sent me a video cussing me out and threatening me for not speaking to them.  I obviously didn’t reply to them, so I essentially ghosted them. I even showed my father the video and told him everything and he agreed that I needed to distance myself. What makes me mad is they tried to lie to him saying they didn’t say anything to me until he confronted them with the video himself. Since then, they’ve been begging for forgiveness over and over. 

Today, we had a death in the family and they’re using it as an opportunity to reconcile with me again. In all honesty, my life improved a lot since cutting them off. I remember being so depressed and constantly anxious when I was friends with them. My confidence grew and I learned how to set better boundaries. The thought of even reconciling just makes me panic. I feel like it’ll trigger me if they do the same thing they always do which is avoid accountability and make me feel crazy for something I know I witnessed. But another part of me feels bad for wanting to ignore the reconciliation message. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-17,0.0,0.0118731605,0,1
165,1c6ordp,AITA for just saying Waiting for you?,"FYI Throw away account.

My husband (36M) and I (40F) had to take my car to get repaired from a collision back in January. I texted my husband that my class was done and I was ready to drop off the car. He didn't answer so I called him and I said between other things ""I am waiting for you"". 

He was 25 minutes away from the place and I was 15 minutes away. I waited 10 minutes and headed to the place and he was furious. He said I told him I was already there and I made him wait 5 minutes (because I was running 2 minutes late but the address took me to a place 3 business down the road so he had to wait 3-4 more minutes for me to get there). 

I told him that all I said was that I was waiting for him, and what I meant was that I was waiting for him to leave home because it didn't make sense for me to go to the place and then call him, making me wait for him 30 minutes at the place, and he just assumed I was there. He says that my saying ""I am waiting for you"" only means that I was at the place. 

I told him we both can be right and wrong, and both of our perspectives are right it was a misunderstanding, but he said I was wrong and should not have said ""I am waiting for you"" because that is wrong.

166,1c6om6m,AITA for asking my friend to stay somewhere else?,"AITA for asking my friend to stay somewhere else? This might be long so I apologize, there’s some backstory i’d need to add. So my (21f) friend (21f), let’s call her Rebecca, got into an argument with her parents and asked to stay with me. I was on the phone with her when it all went down and it was late so I said yes. 
When she got here she immediately started talking about staying here long term. 

For background I live in a house converted into apartments so I live in a very small studio apartment that’s literally a bedroom that fits a twin size bed, dresser, a small countertop for appliances and a small bathroom & there’s a shared kitchen for the entire first floor. There is simply no space for 2 people, I dont even have the room for my own things without it being cluttered in here.

I feel like I may be TA because as a good friend I feel like I should be there for Rebecca and whatever she needs. But then again I have 7 siblings so I have shared a room and had lots of people in the house my entire life, I like having my own space because i’ve never had it before. Im also in a very stressful situation already and am going through a mental health crisis bc of it. Having someone else here just doesn’t feel healthy for me. 

I told Rebecca I don’t mind her being here for a few days to figure things out but more than a couple days won’t work. I work and don’t like the idea of someone being here when i’m not plus I only have one set of keys so she’d be locked out when I leave anyways. My mom asked me to take care of the dogs while they are out of town this weekend and I don’t have a car so to make things easier I am gonna stay at their house. I told Rebecca that she’d need to find somewhere else to stay bc I won’t be there. She wasn’t too happy about it and said “i guess i’ll find somewhere else to stay then” I know it doesn’t seem rude or anything on text but she said it in a very annoyed tone like I was inconveniencing her. 

I have gone above and beyond for her in the past (and not that I expect anything in return) but Rebecca’s “thank yous” are just putting me in uncomfortable situations lol. Like one time i had told her I was getting my nails done with another friend, Rebecca had just gotten out of a relationship and asked to come along. I got done first and walked down to get a coffee for me and my mom. The friend walked out and told me Rebecca didn’t bring any money and needed me to pay for her nails. After that I helped her get a job so she would have money and she ended up ghosting them. This is just one situation where i’ve done something to help her out and ended up rlly just being used in the end. (there are MANY more)

I’ve been friends with her since elementary school so it’s one of those friendships that last no matter what. She knows and has a lot of friends in the area so I don’t think asking her to leave will put her on the streets or anything but I still feel bad because she’s still my friend and I want to help her.

the argument continued and both of us got to the point where we were only saying things to hurt eachother. one of the things he said was that he didn’t understand the makeup thing because i was “the first girlfriend he’s had that wears makeup”. this made me feel so insecure on so many different levels. i have eyebags and some acne that can be easily covered with a skin tint. i’m also iron deficient so i like to add bronzer to give my face some kind of light. him saying this really hurt as i’ve just gotten confident going out without makeup. so, AITA for wearing makeup to school and talking to my male classmates?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-17,0.0,-0.008278711,0,1
168,1c6nw77,WIBTA if I asked my BF to cut back on mentioning/talking to their BF? ,"My (M, 32) boyfriend (M, 35) and I have been together for about 1.5 years now and I feel that him and his best friend’s (M, 34) dynamic/relationship is unhealthy (and sometimes in appropriate). 

It started when my BF told me that his best friend wasn’t being supportive when he got into the relationship (the best friend wasn’t being positive about relationships in general) and my BF felt like (because of the language used by his best friend) that his best friend was jealous. When my BF told me, I responded with “maybe he was trying to lookout” considering I am my BFs first serious relationship. 

Next, when my BF and I decided to move/in together and my BF was telling his best friend, his best friend stated that he was sadden that they (my BF + his best friend) couldn’t live together (even though his best friend had just moved into his own place and he was excited to be living in a place of his own now). I just figured it was just a best friend just making a little funny joke or something along the lines. 

My thoughts began to change when my BF told me that about 5 years ago when him, his best friend, and his nephew went out to a bar, the best friend told the nephew how he thinks my BF wants to be with him and is attracted to him. My BF stated he confronted his best friend but the best friend denied it even though the nephew was adamant that the best friend said that my BF was attracted to him/like/wanted him. 

When my BF told me this I then asked him, “why are you bringing this up to me” as it was kinda out of the blue. My BF’s best friend has recently (the last few months) been calling him several times a day (like 3-5) and at (what I believe is) inappropriate hours like 10, 11 PM, during the week considering he is in a relationship and lives with his partner. The best friend knows that we’re in a relationship (we’ve meet more than once; he’s been to our shared house) but calls back to back every day of the week. Furthermore, my BF has been legit talking to me about this best friend several times a day (one day, 5 times in one day) to the point where I want to ask him “do you want to be with him” because he brings up his best friend often, out of the blue. I thought if I didn’t really mention the friend, etc. then maybe that would help but it hasn’t. My BF legit will bring him up when we’re just having topical conversations about anything (ex. Bringing up the best friend when I’m venting about work). My BF complains to me about how often this friend calls him, etc. but when I advise to set a boundary he kinda just makes excuses. 

Recently, the best friend told my BF he had a dream that he (my BF) was with another man (not me) and that he looked happy. How do I know? Because my BF told me. I asked him why did he bring this up to me (right before bed mind you) and he really didn’t have a good explanation (IMO). 

Am I overreacting to ask my boyfriend to stop or cutback on mentioning this best friend to me?

169,1c6n591,AITA for wanting to kick my friend out of my house?,"My friend, we will call her Amber, (17f) moved in with me (17f) in September of last year and I regret ever letting her live with me.

Amber was kicked out her house by her guardians because she caused havoc in the house because she was grounded. The household was unhealthy and was beginning to fall apart as the guardians were having trouble with their marriage. Amber was very open about this to me and other friends.

My family has an ‘open house policy’ which basically means if anyone needs somewhere to go no matter what, the door will always be open for them. 

So when Amber called me to tell me she had been kicked out and was on the side of the road walking away from the house, and I told my mum, we immediately went and picked her up. 

I was not happy with this situation as I was/am still struggling with my mental health. But I knew it was something that I had to get over for the sake of my friend. I’m also a very introverted person, I enjoy my space and time to be alone. 

All her stuff and car was picked up from the house in the following days. As we only have a 4 bedroom house with 5 people, me and Amber had to share a room. We started to unpack her stuff and place it around the room with the help of another friend (17f), we’ll call her Mia. Instead of just unpacking Amber things, they started to throw away my things and interrogating me on why I had each item no matter the sentimental value i had toward it. Such as jewellery from grandparents and items from my childhood.

In the next few weeks, I got even more irritated. Every time i would clean the room, she would throw rubbish and clothes everywhere in the space of an hour. She wouldn’t help around the house, broke my things and started to be mean and rude. She had no respect for anything that was mine or my family’s. 

Anyways, we didn’t properly speak to each other for a few weeks because of a personal issue that had arose with me.

During this time, I had an inkling she was going through my devices as I would return to them and they would be disabled from too many password attempts. Anyways, caught her in the act when she was going through my shit while I was sleeping, but I never told her.

Despite scattering across different cities for college, careers, and marriage,I would say our bond has remained close over the years.

Among us, Sally remains rooted in our hometown, while the rest of us have moved elsewhere. The communication between the 3 of us is still active through a group chat where we exchange everything from gossip to memes. We make it a priority to reunite during holiday visits when we are all in town and our last in-person gathering was during July 4th of of 2023. At that time, I had mentioned to my 2 friends that I had a would be getting married and would very much love to see them there.

They were both very receptive to making it to my wedding but when it came time to send our e-invites I encountered silence from Sally. Despite numerous attempts via our group chat, calls, and texts, she remained unresponsive. Even our other friend hadn't heard from her. With no digital connection, I resorted to sending a physical wedding invitation to Sally’s childhood home address. The wedding day came and went without a word from her.

My other friend speculated that Sally’s silence might stem from feelings of insecurity about her life situation compared to ours. While the rest of us have settled into marriages, parenthood, stable careers, and homeownership, Sally seems to have remained in a familiar place since high school. While this could be a possibility, this makes me sad to have possibly lost that connection. We never try to intentionally put her down but I think she may feel that way whenever we re-unite on holidays and catch up with each other and talk about our future plans

We are from a working class family and she is the only person with a bachelor’s but she also expects a lot too. Specifically she constantly complains about being tired. She has a 8 year old and 5 year old and complained about how tiring it is to be a parent. She works as an accountant and her husband is a partner at their firm so she only needed to work part time while the kids were young. How that they are in grad school her husband does drop off for school so she can go to the gym. They also have cleaners weekly. They also hire a nanny once a week so they can have a night out alone.

173,1c6lwqk,AITA for running out my roommate,"Alright, so me Sam (M18) and my long time roommate and best friend Greg (m20) recently got a new roommate Frank (m23) and ‘ran him out’, we are not sure if we are the villains in this story so were turning to Reddit. 

It all started this summer, to preface, Greg and I are VERY MESSY, we are clear about this in all of our roommate postings, but we try to keep it clean if the other person is. We told Frank this, and he said he didnt care too much, but he loved to clean so he would keep parts of the room very nice. When it came time to move in, Frank immediately had issues with the condition of our room like peeling paint and dusty windows (We live in a dorm so all of these issues are not really fixable by us) Both Greg and I don’t care much about small stuff, so we pretty much ignored his concerns, and said if he wanted to file a complaint, he could.

This tendency to file complaints continued throughout our living arrangement, with Frank complaining and us mostly ignoring them, until one significant issue, bed bugs. Frank had stated he was bitten, and found a dead bed bug. Frank felt convinced that we had bed bugs because Greg and I leave piles of our clothes out (In front of closets, by the dresser, etc.) However, we both checked our room for bed bugs extensively and found nothing, so the issue was ignored by us again. We mostly dropped the issue and told Frank it was probably spider or mosquito bites. 

In addition to the cleaning issues, Frank, Greg, and I also had very different living styles. Frank would often take tests in the room and wanted complete silence or for us to be gone for hours at a time so they could be done. We mostly obliged, as Greg and I like to be out most of the day anyways. However, once Frank got a girlfriend, it became super often that he would kick us out or ask us to leave so he could spend time with her. The issue became that when we would ask Frank to leave, he always had an issue and would often refuse to leave the room altogether, so out of pettiness, we followed suit. It all came to a head when we walked in on Frank and his girlfriend (After hooking up but still in bed) and refused to leave, as we had already been out for about 4 hours that day. Nothing else eventful really happened after that, until Frank’s family came to town.

Frank and his family came to visit, and while here, his family came into the room and was making derogatory comments towards us about being messy and slobs (I had actually spent ~3 hours that day cleaning my entire room because I wanted to have a fresh start so this really angered me). Additionally, their talking was LOUD and it was clear that they had no regard for us hearing them while they talked about us.

This culminated in Frank again showing up with his family one day and completely packing all of his things silently and moving out.

Just to clarify my husband has told his mum that we couldn’t have her here due to unreasonable demands that HE had to be the one picking her up and dropping her off (she would very offended if we got her a taxi). Their conversation ended with an agree to disagree.

She is still planning to come husband has offered to book her tickets so we could book a convenient time and date but she is not allowing him. Her plan is to inform us after booking.

She is not coming around the time of the birth due to being offended and since my mum will already be here she doesn’t want to come at the same time (my mum is not sad about this tbh).

Also she came after my son was born and her help was she would hold/feed the baby so I could get on with cooking and other chores. I am older now that’s not the help I want.

The sad thing about this is this kind of drama only pushes us away and a can see us seeing less and less of her. But obviously her never taking responsibility for it and blaming me instead.





I (34 F) and my husband (34 M) have always planed to have 2 kids but last summer when we were planning for him to have a vasectomy we had a change of heart and decided that we were not done and wished for one more. We live in a different country from our parents and are raising the 2 children we already have by our selfs (5 M and 3 F). My MiL has always said that having a 3rd would be an absolute horrible idea, irresponsible and would be another grandchild she wouldn’t get to spend much time with. We both have good stable jobs with promotion prospects, own our house and as I said we are raising our children with no support from family. We were lucky enough to get pregnant really quickly and I am now a couple weeks away from having our 3rd child. When we told her we were expecting another kid she was less than enthusiastic, said that she couldn’t celebrate due to her concern about how we would manage and that in the end I always got my way. The whole pregnancy she hasn’t called once asking about how I was doing, when my husband told her about any scans appointments and the subject was quickly changed to something about herself. Now my mum, who is very happy about the 3rd grandchild offered a while back to come and stay with us for 2 weeks to look after the children while I have the baby. I knew from the beginning that I would have to have a c section. After getting the date I messaged her and 10 min later she sent me the plane tricks booked. Later that day my husband called his mum and told her about the date of the c section and that my mum was coming. She instantly became cold and ended the call. We were both confused. Next day his sister called him saying that he had to apologise to his mum for the way he treated her. He spoke with his mum and she said she wished she had been the 1st to know because she wanted to be included in the birth and she wanted to see the baby 1st. She then told him that she had planned to come visit for 4 days around the baby’s. This would involve my husband picking her up from the airport and dropping her at the airport leaving me 3 pp looking after 3 children for 4+ hours (my mum will take the train 1.2 hrs direct from airport to 5 min from my house). I am being accused by MIl and SiL of being selfish and not thinking about including my mil AITA ?

 An hour goes by and me and Sam are still drawing, I notice Mary come downstairs with my mom and John and they sit at the table, my aunt tells Sam to leave which they do and I look up at Mary, my mom, and John, obviously confused. Mary starts telling me how much of a rude little child I've been because I just talked back to my own aunt, which I don't remember doing. 
My Mom and John just stand there as this happens. Mary asks John, who was in a different room during the argument, if I talked back during the argument and he says ""Yes she did"", I say no and tell her I said what and was just confused but she swears that was me being rude and talking back. I start crying and trying to defend myself as two grown adults start telling me in an asshole, my mom just stands there, not really knowing what to do. They yell at me and then I go up to my room, genuinely wondering what I did wrong. Sam comforts me.
After another two days we get kicked out, there was one other argument about a wifi password but that's all. Mary said she felt I didn't respect her and she didn't want me there because she was putting a wall between Mary and my moms relationship. We were there for a week and apparently i'm already too much to handle LMAO

176,1c6lbz0,WIBTA if I changed my job to the another company,"English isn’t my native language but I need help with my situation and I don’t even know if this belongs here . I(19f) live with my family and work at a local swimming club (I have training for it, paid by my current swimming club) and my boss (50m, let’s call him Dave) is a freaking big asshole. All he cares about is money.
Few examples;

1. We had swimming lessons at a local beach last summer. About four swim groups one after another (about an hour/each) without a break from the coaches. It was cold, without proper showers or lunch breaks. All that because Dave wanted more money

2. My friend (16f) was supposedly caught cursing while working with kids and parents complained that to Dave and he -didn’t even ask my friend if it was true or not- blamed my friend about it. Well, my friend wanted to sort things out with the parents and asked Dave if she could get the parent’s number. He said he would ask if it was okay…she didn’t hear anything after that for about three months, even though she asked on several occasions. After three months he came and said to my friend that the parents didn’t want to sort things out. 

3. Our swimming school started a new season after the new year (about 12 kids/group and 2 coaches) almost 3/4 of the season passed and Dave  decided it would be a great idea to fill our groups to the maximum. It would have been an awesome idea if we weren’t almost ready with the swimming lessons and the kids hadn’t made so much progress. Now we have new kids in our groups and none of them are on the same level as the old ones and no one of them can’t get the help or focus they need. 

There’s more but these are from the top of my head.

But now to the question. Another club from my city offered me the opportunity to work with them; the better the salary, and advantages, and the boss  is actually nice one. I have wanted to work for them for about a year but they couldn’t  didn’t have a job to offer me back then. But now they came to ask me if I would be interested and I said yes. After that, I told my parents about the offer and my mom started yelling. She said if I changed I’d have to move out because it would be against our family values, she knows how Dave treats me and my coworkers. But for her my current club can do no wrong and “we have never had any issues” and I should pay back everything the club has done for me. My dad also thinks I shouldn’t change but supports me if I wanted to and also promised to talk with my mom but I don’t want to cause any issues between them. 

Also, I can’t tell you about the offer to my current boss cause he would lose it, I have seen it and no one dares to tell Dave that he sucks. I’m sorry this is long but I don’t know what to do. My mom and Dave are against it but my friends think I should take the offer and i want to take it but then I’d have to move out",Not the A-hole,2024-04-17,0.0,-0.00930839,0,1
177,1c6lacm,WIBTA for telling my friend to break up with her boyfriend?,"I'll try and keep this short. 

I  (23F) have a good friend (19F) that started dating a guy I knew from high school (22M) after 3 days of knowing him. I know this guy really well because we used to be good friends until we naturally drifted apart in college, but we are in the same friend group now. 

This guy treats her TERRIBLY. I don't want to type paragraphs, so here is a list:

1. He constantly jokes about breaking up with her, even in front of our friend group when she is present.
2. He talks about how attractive other girls are all the time.
3. He jokes about having sex with his girl best friend.
4. He calls her a crybaby when she cries and will also often tell her to just go home if she gets emotional. 
5. He blames her for his bad grades (even though he never tells her he can't hang out because he needs to study and when he isn't around her he is always watching YouTube on the couch and waits until last minute to do his homework). 
6. She told me he was freaking out and snapped at her one time which made her anxious, and then he continued to yell at her more.
7. She told me he was a good boyfriend 80% of the time (I told her that's not good enough, it should be 100%).
8. He complains to our friend group about how she doesn't put any effort into her physical appearance anymore (that's literally what people do when they get comfortable in relationships, and she is literally BEAUTIFUL with or without makeup). 

I could go on and on but that's the gist of it. This guy is a douche and I'm worried that since she is a bit younger than the rest of us, that's the reason she is putting up with this since I would've put up with the same shit at 19. 

My other girl friend in that group told me that I should try to bring this up subtly, but I want to straight up tell her that she deserves better and this treatment is borderline abusive and that if the person you're dating really loves and cares about you, they don't get to delegitimize their emotions and make you insecure in your own relationship.

178,1c6ku66,AITA for not wanting my bd at my birth,"I am 17, accidentally pregnant. So obviously i’m unmarried, i chose to break up with my bd a few months ago. I was tired of all the verbal abuse etc, I used to be open to him coming to the birth because i thought it seemed like the right thing to do. After I broke up with him, he initially wanted to send his mum to my birth rather than him. Then he said she wouldn’t come at all. Just very all over the place.

 But after really thinking it through, I expressed I didn’t want him there because I am not comfortable with it. He then proceeded to insult me, called me stupid and ugly. He said i looked like a man, told me he didn’t care about me feeling vulnerable and he said he would even bring a girl to my birthday to show he’s over me and doesn’t want to see me just the kid. Just overall being really disrespectful and stressing me out. 

I know I said I didn’t mind before but honestly I think I didn’t actually process things properly, especially considering my age. I want this experience to be as smooth as possible. I  haven’t banned him from seeing the child completely but i just explained i didn’t want him there at the hospital. 


In addition, I don’t really know how to allow him to be involved. He basically isn’t respecting any of my boundaries and has told me i have “no authority or relation to him”  so he can speak to me how he wants bc he’ll see his child either way. I don’t want to be bitter but I really can’t see myself maintaining communication with him. He has been blocked on everything for now ( i told him i would unblock to let him know when the child is born ).

179,1c6kra5,"AITA for confronting my dad about bad business practices, and possibly making my parents' life much harder?","A few years ago, I started my own contracting business, and worked alone for about a year. When things started picking up, I involved my dad, since he had nothing going on at the time. 

I'm a guy who likes working with my hands, and detest paperwork, and marketing, so I delegated those responsibilities to him. He does all the boring stuff, while I focus on the parts that I enjoy and am good at. He still helps out on site, but does minimal physical labor, which has decreased over the years, since he's no spring chicken.

He also handles the finances, so the money flows through him, and he pays me my half of the labor cost when the job is done. I've been content with this arrangement for years, even though his duties seem to get less with time, while mine increases, but he refuses to change the 50/50 split.

I should mention, I also live on their property, in a separate flat, and pay more than my fair share of the expenses.

About a year ago, on our biggest contract up to then, he made a really big mistake on the quote, and instead of telling me, he tried to hide it, and tried to get me to skip out on the job, so he wouldn't have to face up to his mistake. I had to practically work for free for 2 months, since I believe your quote is your word.

Ever since then, I started paying more attention to his side of the business, and have caught him lying to me, and hiding money from me on a few other occasions. Every time I would give him the benefit of the doubt, or just let it slide, since it was small amounts, and money always seems to be a little tight.

This past week though, he did a similar thing, but with a larger amount. He ordered some materials, and told me the cost was 8K. Only he didn't order enough, and when he ordered a second batch, I took a look at the price, and realized that the original cost was actually 6K. 

So today I went over to the main house, and confronted him about it. My mom was also in the room, which was on purpose, since she's a good mediator, has a way keeping us both calm, and I wanted someone objective to call me out if I'm being unreasonable.

I should mention that my mom recently became unemployed, so things are tighter than usual. I guess that's why my dad is looking to make some extra money wherever he can. Still, I don't think that's an excuse to lie to your business partner, or your son.

The discussion was difficult. I asked him about the cost, and he lied to me again. I eventually got him to admit that he hid the money from me, and I told him I no longer want to work with him anymore. I'll also be moving out as soon as I find a decent place.

Problem is, this will put them in a really difficult position, since they won't have my contribution to expenses, and neither one of them will have an income. They can rent the flat out, but that won't cover their living costs alone. They're looking to retire, but they really don't have a plan for that. All they have is their house, which they will probably have to sell.

I make good money for my age so money isn’t an issue but I’m not one to go out clubbing and to bars and gamble. I’ve drank before I went to parties in HS but I grew out of it when everyone moved away to go to school  and I took over a managerial position. I don’t drink much at all anymore and they are just sure about getting me fucked up and going to titty bars n such. 
Im not a bad looking guy IMO but I don’t think I can put on a facade long enough to go out for a Vegas length night and they want to do three nights. I’ve also been trying to save more money and I feel like Vegas is super expensive.


My family is constantly reminding me and nagging at that we’re going to go to Vegas. I say I’m not sure I’ll think about it, and they get upset that im wasting my 20s working away and not going out saying I’ll regret it all. They say I need to travel more and that might have a little truth  but I do travel occasionally by myself just not on group trips or anything. 

Im 20, turning 21 in August and everybody is planning different dates on going to Vegas on both sides of my family and a two of my friends also.I doubt my friends will be able to come as they’ll be in school so it will probably just be my family.

181,1c6kd4x,WIBTA If I don't invite my (22f) friend (23m) to my birthday party?,"Throwaway since the friend this post is about knows my main. 

&#x200B;

Also, what the title says. 

&#x200B;

For context, my birthday is in May and I've been trying to decide who to invite to the party. I'm confident on inviting most of my closest friends, but there's one, Daniel (fake name), who I'm not so sure about. 

&#x200B;

There are many reasons as to why I'm not completely comfortable with him coming. First being, that everytime I invite Daniel to hang out (like watching a movie, going out to eat, going to a museum, etc.) he either tells me no, cancels last minute or ghosts me for the day. Sometimes leaving me waiting on a videocall on discord. 

&#x200B;

Alongside that, he has this habit of promising stuff and then not doing it unless I remind him of it. Some time ago I asked him for a recommendation and he told me he'd do it the same day. Daniel sent it to me 3 weeks after he told me. 

&#x200B;

He's a huge introvert and I get that he likes to have his own space, which is why I don't want to pressure him into doing something he doesn't want to do. I also know he has a difficult time opening up to others. 

&#x200B;

Despite that, I do care about him and he has been great about listening to me and helping me with my own issues. Which is why I'm not fully sure if I'm overreacting to a minor issue or if it's a bigger deal. We've talked about this many times and he's actually made some progress on this area. 

&#x200B;

Also, we have some mutual friends who would most definitely notice something's off, and I think it would make things awkward between all of us.

182,1c6kcys,AITA for giving my roommate 30 day’s notice for causing drama?,"I have high bills and had to have roommates to help makes ends meet. I rent out 2 rooms in my house for $500 a month including Utilities, and wifi. I recently had to renew both roommates since they both left about same time. I interviewed “Mia” as a roommate (she is my sisters friend) 2 months ago and she tells me she has a dog that would come with her. I don’t charge her anything extra on move in because of how bad her current living conditions are and would be happy to help her out. I let her have that month free of charge because she had to sleep on my couch for the first 2 weeks. Mia began helping cleaning the house and asked me if i would like her to feed my dog when she feeds hers. I said sure, as this began to happen normally I offered to lower her rent by $50 because of this. She then also offered to help buy my dogs food for which I also took off another $50 so she only had to pay $400. It was established that rent is always due by the 1st. Mia comes to me a week before the 1st and tells me she can’t afford to pay the rent in full and can only pay $200 because she needed $200 to eat. My husband asked if $300 is ok this week and $100 next after she gets paid again. He also offers to cook for her and allow her to eat from our supply. She accepts. I was a little worried about her dog after the dog was near me and then my husband walked by and the dog snarled at him. It scared both of us. I am military had to deploy 2 weeks ago around the 1st. My husband has told me since Ive been gone Mia struggled to pay the $100. and has mentioned her money issues alot. She recently offered to pay ahead by $100 now and $100 next week but the rest might be late because her car insurance. My husband tells me he is very frustrated and tells her how he feels about it and wasn’t very nice. I am frustrated by her lack of commitment to paying rent on time when i feel like we’ve been very generous. My husband doesn’t have a job right now but is looking for one. He also doesn’t do as many chores as he should because things have been hard for the both of us recently. He mentions that there has been dog pee on the carpet and my couch and pillows have been chewed up. My dog doesn’t do that. I messaged my sister and wanted to let her know what was going on. she said right off that bat that Mia was telling her everything. She said my husband was being rude and demanding rent. That he doesn’t clean and plays video games all day. I try to begin telling her my side but i don’t have time to finish before she accuses me of taking his side without talking to Mia. She then blocks me. In my mind I’m thinking, I’m deployed why am I dealing with this. So I’m just done and over it. I tell my husband to give back the $100 she gave and and give her a 30 days notice to leave. I then send her a message explaining that I was sorry for her not living in a comfortable home and that she had 30 days to move out.

But I came home for the week for my sister’s engagement and realised I needed to tell her so that I can get it treated before the day arrives.

She continued to tell me that UTI also happen because of sex and I pretended like I didn’t even know.
I told her how she could even think of such a thing when she knows everything about my life and made her believe she was wrong in thinking so and that the reason I gave her was true because I wasn’t facing symptoms nearly as severe as my report which is true though.

186,1c6irk6,AITA for sitting in silence while my friend has a panic attack?,"I (14f) have a friend group of 8 people that I love to bits. Me and one of my good friends, we’ll call her Annette, have a complicated relationship. We first became friends around summer 2023, when I was in a bad place and was just glad to have someone to talk to.

Fast forward to Sep and I start noticing things about Annette that I hadn’t before. She started to make little comments about me, about small things, like my relationships with boys. I’m not particularly attractive, but I am quite outgoing and talk to a few guys. Anytime I pointed out a boy a thought was cute, Annette would call me ‘boy-obsessed’ and would make it her point to tell everyone. I didn’t mind at all at first, since I thought she meant it endearingly, but I started to notice the edge in her voice and how people started treating me because of her comments.

Nov, I ask her to stop. I remember her being stressed about something that day, but she was often stressed and I’d had to work myself up to talk to her so I just decided to go for it. I knew i wasn’t imagining it as the other girl closest to her (her childhood best-friend) also had experience with her making comments about her appearance. I got a weak apology and some woeful tales about her life trying to victimise herself and draw attention away from the situation.

After this, she started to take things that happened in my life and say they happened to her. Someone compliments me, she tells everyone they were complimenting her. Once I remember being told from a well-known competitor at a debate that I deserved an award. She told everyone he said that to her. 

Christmas. I’m going crazy and reaching my limit. We‘re at a party and she‘s talking about one of her problems that she used to play victim in Nov. I shut her down. She told everyone I never listened to her and I got shouted at by 2 girls. I was about to cry but wouldn’t ruin a party, so I was silent. After, Annette smiles at me, I don’t return it. I sit on the couch and Annette’s visibly upset. My other 2 friends are telling me to just say I’m not mad, as that’s why shes upset. It’s been two minutes since I’d been shouted at in front of everyone. I say no. They keep pressuring me and so I finally break and scream ‘NO! DO YOU WANT ME TO GET A RIDE HOME?!’ I run into the bathroom and cry my eyes out. Nobody comes after me. I come back into the room and suddenly Annette starts having a panic attack, hyperventilating, etc. My friend tells me she wants me to reassure her I’m not mad and come over, but I don’t. Not because I’m a bitch, but because throughout our whole friendship she always told me she hated people and wanted to be left alone while upset. The panic attack goes on for nearly 2 hours. Everyone thinks the whole situation was my fault and she tells everyone it is. I’ve tried so hard but I don’t feel any sympathy towards her attack even now and I just need to know was it my fault??

187,1c6imue,AITA for inviting my son's dad's ex-girlfriend to my son's birthday party?,"Last Saturday was my middle son's 8th birthday party. My ex-husband and I have two other sons together (10 & 6) and we've been divorced since 2018. 

My ex-husband also has 3 older children; an adult daughter and 2 teenage sons. The daughter obviously got an invite, as did the two boys and their mom. He had no issue with me inviting his older son's mom.

However, I did also invite his ex-girlfriend that he started dating while we were still together and broke up with in 2021. Our marriage was ""polyamorous"" and I also had a relationship with the same girl for a short period. We've remained close over the years and I currently consider her one of my closest friends. 

On top of this, my kids absolutely adore her and she's been such a large part of their lives. She was living with their dad in 2020 so they spent a lot of time with her and I think consider her an important adult in their lives. 

For our kids parties we always invite extended family and family friends, as well as their classmates and other friends. I think this ex-girlfriend fits within that category. My ex-husband obviously agreed at some point because she was at all our sons' parties last year. 

However, this year he was immediately pissed when he saw her at the party. She was there before him to help me set up, and he later pulled me aside to ask me why I would have invited her. When I told him he hadn't told me not to invite her, he turned it around and accused me of not asking. If had told me beforehand he didn't want her there I maybe could have seen myself not inviting her, but he didn't. 

He had brought his current girlfriend and two of her teenage children to the party, and made it out that that was the reason he didn't want her there. He's been dating her since late 2022 so that doesn't even make sense to me because our 6 year old's birthday was in November and I invited the ex-girlfriend and he invited his girlfriend and there was no issue then. 

However, that party was the first time he had brought his girlfriend and I asked beforehand about still inviting the ex-girlfriend and he said yes. Maybe I set a precedent by asking that first time.

Was I the asshole? He's still quite mad at me and we've been texting back and forth arguing about this and now other stuff. I feel bad at causing an issue. The ex-girlfriend is also kind of upset with me as she assumed he knew she would be there and would be fine with it.

Later into the year we stopped calling or even texting, this did not bother me at first but I started to notice the distance there was between us. This brings me to the present, me and my friends where at a restaurant finishing a project and I left my phone on the table for around 5 minutes and when I came back Maria gave me my phone back unlocked, I realized she had went through the messages between me and my friends when we were talking about how Amelia is a bad influence on Maria. I argued with her on how she could go through my phone without my permission, I somehow ended up being at fault and had to apologize to her yet I still had a grudge for a few days.

 A few weeks ago we celebrated Marias birthday with a dinner for the first time since we became friends, during the dinner Amelia would not stop giving me dirty looks.

My fiance feels the same way which is why he tries to hang out with his best friend one on one most times.

My fiance is supportive of whatever I want to do but has also mentioned that he would love to travel with Aaron some time. I told them they can be friends with Lauren and hang out with her, I just personally don’t want to spend any more time with her than I have to.

We had dinner recently with my friends + Aaron and Lauren and someone brought up my birthday trip and since they were there, they assumed that meant they were also invited. The day after Aaron brought up to my fiance that he should start planning PTO but my fiance made a comment that nothing was concrete yet and is waiting for my decision.

190,1c6hisj,AITA for telling my sister she owes me money for stealing my watch?,"I (15M) had my birthday last year July and my uncle gave me a watch as a birthday present. I didn't really have a use for it tho i already carried my phone everywhere, but i looked forward to wearing it for stuff like formal events or church, i rlly liked this watch. 

One day my sister (14F) had some after school project and she wanted to borrow the watch to keep track of the time. The thing is, the watch was still fairly new and i had only worn it like three times ever, but I let her borrow the watch for that day and everything went well.
During around September (last year), I've noticed that my watch had gone missing and wasn't at the usual place i kept it. We were writing exams at the time and i wanted to use it to keep track of time, but I just assumed i misplaced it 'cause i do that a lot and kinda forgot about it.

Fast forward to today, and as I went to greet my sister in the morning i noticed my sister was wearing my watch. I questioned her and things quickly escalated. She said that she needed it for school and i argued she never even asked me and i barely even got to use it. She gave it back to me and it looked all brown and worn, and plus it was even scratched. I told she owed me 20 bucks (just over 1 US dollar) because she couldn't just take and ruin my birthday present without me even knowing. My mum told me I thought i gave the watch to her and my sister admitted to lying that i knew about this and that the watch was apparently hers now. however, i admit i should've investigated more when i noticed it went missing.

This afternoon, my sister and I were arguing about whether she really owes me the money, and my mum took my side and said that I'm lucky i didn't ask her to buy a whole new watch, it cost over 500 bucks (26-27 ish US dollars). That just got me thinking about my decision because it was kinda impulsive and out of anger, and that's why I think i'm the asshole, for telling my sister she owes me money because of my own negligence.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-17,0.0,0.011324404,0,1

He is bestfriends with his ex and were roommates until early this year. They broke up 5 years ago and were together for a decade+. I tried to be friends with her early in the relationship but she unfriended me because she thought that I was just talking to her to fish for information.

Both of them are having a trip out of the country to watch a concert, for a week long. I made it clear to my bf that I want them to book separate rooms and he agreed but the topic got brought up again and he said he feels bad for his best friend because if they book one room(2beds) they would save a lot. He said his coworkers think it's weird that they're booking separate rooms. Am i the asshole for not letting them and for thinking that this shouldn't even be a discussion.

192,1c6h157,AITA for telling a parent at a youth hockey game to STFU,"For context I'm (25M) a Junior A hockey official in Canada that helps the rookie officials in the minor hockey system at my local rink (unofficially. I don't have any affiliation with the local hockey association)

During a U11 game there was a rookie official (14M) working the game and a parent was unhappy about a call the ref had made (I'm assuming against her son) and she started to scream and swear at this young ref

She was only a few seats away from me and I essentially told her

""STFU it's a U11 game and these are children you're screaming at. Show some fucking respect, the game wouldn't be happening without the refs""

We went back and forth but it ended with her leaving the seating section on her own accord

After the game I was in the referee room going over the game and I heard a knock on the door, and when I opened it I was surprised to see the same woman looking back at me. She started yelling at me that I shouldn't have embarrassed her like that in front of the other parents on the team, and that she's allowed to yell at refs, which her reasoning was ""If they can't take a couple jeers then they shouldn't be referees""

I told her to go fuck her hat

Obviously she put in a complaint against me which didn't go anywhere but some people I've told the story to have told me I should have been less abrasive towards the woman

I get that referees are generally criticized by the crowd and other players and when I officiate I'm fine with it because at a higher level of hockey (or any sport for that matter), she's correct in the fact we need to have thick skin. However, I highly dislike seeing young officials quitting due to abuse from minor hockey coaches and parents

193,1c6gimx,AITAH for supporting my dad’s hobby?,"This is so petty and stupid but I need to know. It’s nothing illegal or intense. It’s a damn motorcycle. My dad had a bike when I was a kid and I was his primary passenger other than my mom. Because of this, I love riding. I can’t ride myself because my brain and body don’t coordinate well, but my husband does and he never has to ask me twice to get on lol. My parents got divorced and he had to sell the bike when he got orders to PCS overseas and got deployed, so he couldn’t take it with him. 

Fast forward ~20 years later, he’s been remarried for 15 years. He bought himself a new bike a couple of years ago and my step mother (who I do love despite us occasionally butting heads) was FURIOUS even though he told her for almost a year he was getting one, and even got her a fancy spoiled cat that she wanted from a breeder as a compromise. Like she didn’t talk to him for 2 days when he brought the bike home. And he told her weeks before he brought it home that he bought it. He makes the bike payments and insurance. She never rides with him and gets shitty when he goes for rides on weekends even though he always invites her and wants her to go with. Not crazy long weekend rides, more like just a couple of hours. And it’s not even really concerns about being safe, because he does ride in full leather and a helmet. 

He wants to get a new bike this year for his birthday and she is again pissed about it. When I call home every week the topic gets brought up and she tries to get me to side with her. She’ll even be the one to bring it up. “Tell him he doesn’t need to have a bike.” Like I said, I love riding and I know my dad does. In fact it’s something he and my husband bonded over when I started dating my husband. I’ve told her she doesn’t have to ride with him if she doesn’t want to but let him enjoy life and have his own hobbies besides wood work. 

This last time I said that and she got shitty with both of us while I was on the phone and said something about getting divorced. Not sure if she was joking, but I didn’t say anything and instead changed the subject. I’m not about to get involved on that level with their marriage. Dad asked if I’m coming home to visit this summer (I live in a different state) and if he does end up getting a bike this year can we coordinate it so I can drive him to the dealership. He also wants to also plan a trip to ride with my husband and I, whether she drives herself there or stays home. 

If she is serious, I don’t want to see their marriage end because of something he enjoys that’s legal and helps him unwind after a day of work, and the people pleaser part of me feels like I would get partially blamed because I fully encourage and support him in riding. As far as I know their marriage is otherwise strong and happy, so I think this would be a really dumb reason to divorce.

A few years ago, my brother in law treated me and my husband very poorly and excluded me from a lot of things just for being friends with his gf. He wanted to family to get to know her and i did. Then when we got close, he said ""i could be her friend"" to the family but behind closed doors says ""i cannot speak to her"", along with many other brutal things said to me and about me behind my back. This turned into a feud in the family because they cater to his every need and believe everything he says. I have also been in this family for 15 years.

Side note: my mother in law has high anxiety (with no treatment) and a NEED to keep the family together.  (she calls all her kids about 3 times a day) She runs on high emotion so i know it will offend her. My Father in law is one to say ""just get over it"" and they all sweep issues under the rug.

She wastes a lot of time during the day and when I am about to leave, she gives me work that is also in her KRA to do just because I am a copywriter. For example, giving captions for social media posts for the brand. As a social media manager, it is her responsibility to do the captions but because I am a copywriter, she asks me to do it.

I’m also terribly guilt ridden and confused. One minute I think I’m fully in the right and the next I think I’m being horrible. 

My parents died four months ago due to long standing health issues and old age, my mother first and then three weeks later my father. My parents had two sons and one daughter. I’m 38, my brothers are 46 and 47. My brothers lived at my parents house. All their lives our parents catered to them hand and foot. They fed their egos three meals a day. As they aged it became harder and harder, eventually they were just worn out by my brothers. Throughout the last few years my parents tried to set boundaries but my brothers took it as a declaration of war. In the end they pretty much lived in fear of my brothers. 

When my parents died they left me the house and some money, I was truly surprised. I like everyone else assumed my brothers would get it all. They left a letter saying they greatly regretted having favored my brothers and for having to rely on me in their old age and as compensation for having financially supported them the past 15 years they left me the house and for 525 thousand of insurance payouts to be divided between the three of us. They acknowledged in the letter that they know the house and my 175 thousand doesn’t come close to financially compensating me but they hoped it at least helped. My plans are to use my share of the inheritance to fix up the house. It’s an old house and it needs considerable amount of work to bring it up to code.

My brothers had no intentions in helping me with the house. They continued being lazy, arrogant and entitled. I continued to pay all the utility bills and whatever else the house needed. I couldn’t afford to keep paying. I asked them to move out several times and they flat out refused.

My brothers also went through their inheritance like it was nothing. They are quickly running out of money. They bought cars, went to Vegas and just spent like there was no tomorrow. I had enough of trying to be reasonable and I demolished half of the house while they were on their cruise. My brothers went on a cruise last month and during their time away I packed all their things into two storage units and I paid 6 months in advance for them and then I just let the construction crew start working on the house. My brothers returned to a construction site. They called and texted me a few hundred times but I never picked up. Eventually they got other family members to call me. Everyone is making me out to be a monster. Apparently I’m a terrible sister and that my parents would be disappointed in me for leaving my brothers homeless and living in a motel.

I feel like I’ve done enough for them. I’ve supported them in some way or another my whole life. I tried to be reasonable but they are unreasonable and insanely entitled.

201,1c6fdgj,AITA concert tix resale ,"Last August I bought 4 tix at face value to a concert happening this July for myself, 2 friends, and was going to find someone for the 4th, which would’ve been easy because I have friends that would join. I laid out the money and the others would pay me back closer to the show. I tend to be the doer of the group…most times if I don’t make moves, things will “stay in the group chat” so to speak. 
A few weeks ago, the 2 friends said “we don’t even know the artist’s new music, let’s sell them and buy tix to a different artist that we do know.” Which was a good point so I put them up for sale for about 2x what I paid since that’s around what the current resale comps are for the section. So far 2 have sold, and 2 remain for sale. 
Now the resale tix prices for the new show are sky high and those friends just told me they were under the impression that we were gonna use the profits from the resale of the original tix to buy the new tix. 
But they never paid me for the original tix therefore any profits from the resale should be mine only. I did all the legwork buying the tix, laying out the money 8 months ago, making a resale account and putting them up for resale. Still no money has been exchanged from them so how are they entitled to anything?
This seems to have caused a rift but those friends are both more financially well off than I am so I’m really not inclined to back down. AITA?

I (35F) have a friend, “Sally” (32F) I’ve known for years. She does facials, waxing and recently eye lash extensions. I’ve gone to her for facials and waxing but not eye lash extensions because I just don’t want to do them. I have had them before but I am now at a point where I’m happy with my natural lashes. 

Anyway, my friend recently asked me to model her lash extensions because not too many people were coming back to get the fill ins like they should.  She wanted me to purchase a package of mega volume lash extensions with two fills scheduled within six weeks. I declined because her prices are fair for her service, which means it’s out of my budget. I also explained that I don’t want lash extensions, but perhaps I could schedule a facial or waxing at the time she was offering a lash extension. 

She said she didn’t need any more facial clients, but she needed the lash side of her business to grow. She said lashes are less time consuming and the products are easier to obtain for her than facial products. I declined again because of budget reasons, but also expressed that I do not want lash extensions. Perhaps she should advertise for a model? She told me that all the models want the lashes for free.

Things got heated because she really wanted me to model her lashes and I kept saying no. She then told me “We can’t be friends because you don’t support my business.” 

Anyway, she’s decided to block me on all social medias, but before doing that she posted on her story and messaged me that “Fake friends will bring you down to their level instead of raising you up out of the mud.” 

I thought it was a little extreme because I feel like lash extensions are personal and to each their own. I understand it’s her business, which is why I offered to support her in other ways.

However my life wasn't always so great. While growing up, i never had a close relationship with my parents and siblings (2 older brothers, 1 younger sister). They did things together that I wasn't interested in. And my parents never had any time for me. By the time I was a teen, I just realised that I wasn't important to them and made peace with it. 

After I moved out, it was almost as if family didn't even exist. I went years without talking to my siblings and only spoke to my parents once or twice a year. 

Fast forward to about 8 months ago, I found out that my father was cheating on my mother with my former friend. My husband and I were on vacation and coincidentally, my father and his side piece were staying at the same hotel as we were. We saw them come out of a room together, arms around each other. 

My father turned pale, but I didn't say a word to him. My husband and I just went to stay at a different hotel because I didn't want our vacation ruined. 

About a week after we came home, my father showed up at our house. He had been calling me all week, but I ignored his calls. He begged me not to tell his wife. I told him I wouldn't because simply don't care. 

Cut to two weeks ago, the side piece contacted my eldest bother and told him everything. Apparently, my father had dumped her and she wanted to get back at him. She also told him that I knew.

Of course, my mother found out and called me. She screamed at me about ""betraying"" her. I just told her that since I was never a part of her perfect family, the state of her marriage was none of my business. Then I blocked her.

But when I point out women who seem to be warming to him where he could have a chance he will always point out the things he doesn’t want in a partner ( overweight, has to be good looking and so on). 

So last week while a group of us were out (we have all been friends for many years) the conversation about him being single came up. He started talking about his standards and how he would rather be single than settle for less. Maybe I was wrong but I kind of said to him that if the woman he likes has the same standards as he does, then he wouldn’t stand a chance. There was few seconds of silence after that then we just moved on to a different conversation. Afterwards while talking to another one of the friend group he said that I was a bit out of order ( U.K. slang for being a bit horrible) and was basically calling my friend ugly. I seriously didn’t mean it in that way, but I do believe he is setting his sights on people out of his league, and so far with him being single I’ve been proven right.

The day of:
She’s a big smoker so we woke up and she wanted to hit a dispensary. I don’t smoke.  Once again I booked the Lyft and paid for it (there and back) . We had the driver drop us off at another casino hotel to grab breakfast. Then hit the slots there. We both were losing so we left and walked the strip to another casino.  We both were still losing. I sat down at one machine and made all the money I lost back. I was cashing my ticket out and saw a slot I usually like. I said “I’ll throw a $20 in and if I win I’ll give you half of it” I hit the bonus a few spins in. It was a $60 bonus. I gave her $30. We cashed out and headed to a 3rd casino at this point she was at least hitting and made some money back. I was losing. We played for a bit and then decided to head back to our hotel for lunch. We stopped to play a few slots before heading to lunch. We separated and I played one machine, I seen her and walked up to her. She pointed at a machine across the aisle from her and said “try that one”. I got on and it forced a bonus. I hit a jackpot for $3,750($2850 after taxes). MY FIRST HANDPAY ever! I was shaking excitedly. She immediately started throwing sly comments at me. She was MAD I won. Which did not sit right with me.  Before I even got the money she said “I deserve $1,000.” I shot that down. I replied “I’m not giving you $1000 but I’ll give you something. I have to talk to my husband” She called her boyfriend crying and all I got was attitude. My joy of a first time handpay was taken from me within minutes. 
I got paid out and to start I gave her the $25 I had on the ticket I took out of the machine. We headed to lunch. Lunch was not fun. She was quiet, pissed and texting a ton. She tried to pay half but I told her I got it and gave the waitress the money. She tried to force her money on me. I said no. She replied with “you’re just paying out of spite”. I’m not a confrontation girlie but that sent me off the ledge. We argued. 
After lunch we separated. I called my friend sobbing. He and his wife calmed me down. I went up to the room to talk to her after about an hour.I  decided to give her $200 in cash, offered to pay for a few meals while we’re there and all the ride shares (Since we were 3 rides in and she hadn’t paid).

207,1c6ei4v,"AITA for yelling at my (23f) friend (25f) and boyfriend (23m) over the actions of a ""ghost""?","I made a post earlier but accidentally deleted it, whoops

So about 3 months ago I moved in to an apartment with my friend (Hailey) and my boyfriend (Nick). We've been friends for a long time and usually get along really well. They've lived in the apartment for well over a year whereas I just moved in.

A few days after moving in, we were interrupted by a noise coming from the attic (a little attic that a person can't fit into without crawling) like an animal ""giggling"" (similar to the hehe noise foxes make). Hailey laughed and went ""oh, that's the ghost"", and Nick says they hear that noise sometimes. Hailey keeps joking about it being a ghost, and I asked her very politely not to because I get scared easily. Especially since there's a hole in my bedroom ceiling that's creepy at night. She's like, ok fine, and didn't bring it up again that night.

That's where the issue started. Ever since then ""weird"" things keep happening and I'm positive it's Hailey and/or Nick trying to mess with me:

* I hear different animal noises/""voices"" coming from the attic. They sound faintly ""fake""/tinny like a recording. I did stick my head up but couldn't find anything. When I mentioned it Hailey laughed and said it was probably just a squirrel
* scratching sound coming from the other rooms
* the clocks in the house were set to random times when I woke up
* Nick and Hailey have both pointed out ""symptoms"" of the house being haunted

I hate this, it scares me. I keep telling them to stop and they both will claim innocence every time it comes up. But despite the source of this ""ghost"" being obviously one or both of them, I've never actually caught them doing anything so can't really call them out on it

It came to a head yesterday. I was on my bed on my laptop. I looked up and in the ceiling hole there was an ""animal"" sticking it's face out. It's possible to stick a halloween mask or something through there from the attic and this was obviously not a real animal (it didn't look like any real animal, it was a pink thing with a narrow ""nose"" and big teeth. those pink dolphins from the amazon are the first thing that comes to mind). I shouted and it pulled away. A minute later both my boyfriend and Hailey were there asking if I was ok. I got really angry - I told them to shut up and it was fucked up that they were still playing this prank on me and escalating it when I had asked them to stop day one. They got really defensive about it - Hailey walked away and Nick said he hadn't done anything and didn't get why I was yelling at him. I told him to fuck off and that I was sick of him and he went back downstairs.

We haven't talked since and I feel really shitty about it. I don't actually know which one of them it was and just yelled harshly at both of them because I was freaked out. AITA here for going off so heavily on both of them in the moment when I've been putting up with this for months?

TLDR; roommate/s faking a haunting to prank me, one of them went way too far. I yelled at both of them.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-17,0.0,0.100919336,0,1
208,1c6ee5b,AITA for telling my husband’s family I’m pregnant first.,"For context, my husband is 26(M) and I am 25(F) and we recently found out that we are pregnant and decided to wait till 11 weeks to tell friends and family. During this we chose to tell my husband’s family first as it was the day before my birthday and we’re able to use the excuse of a birthday brunch to get everyone together. The brunch went wonderful and it was a great experience finally telling family. The following day was my actual birthday and we decided to announce to my family with a birthday present. The day went off perfectly and my family was so beyond excited. Until I made a comment about my husband’s families reaction from earlier. This lead to my mother leaving the party early and to go upstairs to her bedroom (the party was at my parents house) where she then complained to my sister about not being the first mother to know. I later learned of this issue as my mother had a conversation with me about being hurt by my actions as she felt it was important for her to know first since she had trouble conceiving for years. She ended up crying and telling me she didn’t want to upset me, but that she wanted to tell me her feelings so that she didn’t have any negativity towards the rest of my pregnancy. I apologized and held her hand and consoled her for 30 mins before moving on to the gender reveal party which I asked her to help me plan. 

I guess my question now is whether or not I should be upset at my mother. I feel as though she took something that was such an important moment for my husband and I and made it all about herself. I also feel as though she does not respect my husband’s family, as she has always had an issue with my MIL. This incident has left a very bitter taste in my mouth. On one note I am glad that my mother feels better and was able to get her feelings off her chest. On the other side I am upset at how her betterment was at the expense of my own feelings and I now feel that I will constantly have to put my mother first in my pregnancy.

209,1c6ecud,AITA for telling a dad at a high school soccer game that his constant yelling at the sideline ref is more likely to hurt our team than anything else?,"So, I was on the sideline at a high school soccer game; it’s mostly just folks sitting with their lawn chairs along the sideline, standing and talking to each other, their dogs on leashes, kids playing or riding bikes nearby, etc. Fairly mellow vibe. But this one man standing nearby was constantly ragging on the sideline official—the one who only runs back and forth with the flag.

This guy wasn’t just saying “oh come on,” or “there’s no way that’s offsides” when something came up, but would continue to complain about perceived bad calls or missed calls, referring back to previous plays, yelling at the ref individually, as if really genuinely trying to engage him in an argument. There were actually a few times when the ref addressed this guy because he was yelling at him so loudly and constantly.

A few other parents nearby actually exchanged glances with me as he’d be in a yelling fit, kind of eye-rolls and “is this really going to go on the whole game” kind of thing. I teach part-time at this high school, but wasn’t wearing anything that really identified me as a teacher, probably just a school hat or logo sweatshirt or something. The thing is, we have a code of conduct for our students here that doesn’t allow disparaging remarks toward individual opponents or the officials. If it were a student behaving this way, they definitely would have been out of line and I would have corrected them much sooner.

So I felt somewhat obligated as a faculty member to say something, but I think even if I hadn’t been I still would have said something, because just from a practical perspective, it can actually hurt your team when someone is verbally assaulting an individual official personally and constantly—in addition to the fact that it’s just not pleasant and it’s uncivil to be around.

I eventually told him, “Hey there, I don’t think that constantly insulting the ref is really helping our team.” He was like, “Oh, don’t worry, I know what I’m doing.” So then I tried to explain that no, actually it’s both annoying, petty, and more likely than not going to make him annoyed at our side. He definitely acted like he has a right to do whatever he wants (which: adult, so yeah), and that I must be some kind of lower-class peon to be questioning his wisdom in these things, like this is his ongoing plan of engagement for “doing his part” to help his son’s team out. 

I think at one point I probably pointed out that if I were his son, I’d probably be embarrassed that my dad was carrying on like that. I also asked him if this was his first soccer game, which he didn’t appreciate lol. I failed to point out, but wish I had, that we specifically tell our students that his behavior is not permitted at games.

211,1c6dfo3,AITA for blaming my stepfather for me potentially having to drop out of university?,"A little bit of context for people that aren’t from the UK, but here the amount of student loan you receive is based on your household income. My parents are divorced and my mum has been in a relationship with my stepfather since i was 7, i’m now 19 and finishing my first year of university. My mum can only work part time as she is a full time carer for my disabled sister. My stepdad is quite wealthy and earns a lot at his job. 

Because of this, I was only entitled to the minimum student loan of 4k as the government expects wealthier families to chip in. My rent alone is 6k so it doesn’t even cover rent, let alone living expenses, so this year has been very hard for me financially. When my stepdad found out that I was only getting 4k, my mum asked him to chip in so that I could afford rent, and then my real dad would help me with living expenses (he earns very little and is already helping my stepsister through uni too.) My stepdad’s response was “She’s not my daughter.” 

So far, he has not given me a penny, and my mum has resorted to sending me all of her wages despite her earning very little. I feel awful that she’s been working hard solely to help me and doesn’t get to keep anything for herself. 

Going into the second year of university, I needed to find private accommodation as I could no longer stay in student accom. Unfortunately, with a 4k loan i’ve been unable to find anywhere that I can afford and at the moment my only option is to drop out as I have nowhere to live next year.

I’m so upset because I know that he has the money to help me find somewhere to live but simply doesn’t want to, and now I will probably have to give up my dream university. 

I’ve told him that this is his fault for refusing to help simply because I’m not his biological daughter and he said that I’m acting entitled, and so we aren’t speaking and things are very tense. AITA for expecting him to support me?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-17,0.0,0.9524801,1,0
212,1c6ddet,AITA for annoying my flatmate by using her things ,"I’m in a university flat, and I (18M) live with three girls all a couple years older than me. Today my flatmate sent me a really long, passive aggressive paragraph about how she doesn’t want me to use her stuff anymore. 

She detailed that I use her pan lid for when I’m boiling rice and that I don’t ask her which is rude. She said to me when I first moved in that if I ever needed to use any of her stuff I could, as long as I cleaned it up and put it back afterwards, which I always do. Surely I shouldn’t have to ask her every single time I want to use it as I’ve previously been given permission? She said that every time I use the pan lid that there’s always some sort of rice grain on it, which I doubt is true as I do properly clean. That being said it is a valid point if I have left it with food on a couple times as that’s not ideal. 

She also mentioned that I don’t use her airfryer properly. I use it to cook chips sometimes and she once told me that one setting cooks chips a lot better than the one I was using. I tried that setting and found out what she said was not true, so kept using it as I was. Surely cooking one thing on a certain setting doesn’t damage the airfryer? Feel like there was no need to mention that 

That’s all she said really, from this point onward I won’t use her stuff as she requested but I feel like the really long message was a bit pointless from her. ",Asshole,2024-04-17,1.0,1.0406653,1,1

We skipped a couple years after our honeymoon to save up more money, but this last time we went our in laws yelled at us for going without them.  
  
In the past we have been asked to go on vacation with my in-laws, but we felt the trip was not a good fit for us and declined.  
  
This time around, though, the family discussion was going to this same popular theme park as a family. We told our in-laws we were still planning on going on our own yearly trip, so we didn't know if we could go with them, but that we would look into it depending on when they wanted to go.  
  
We were told they decided to go during Christmas, which is expensive and crowded. On top of that, we were told that we should room with my brother in law and niece to make it more affordable, which made me uncomfortable. My brother in law is nice enough, but we don't really know each other all that well, and I wanted more privacy and space for my husband and I. I told my in-laws my husband and I would get our own room, but mother in law said it wouldn't be fair because then brother in law wouldn't be able to afford to go with my niece.  
  
My husband and I discussed things, and we decided since we had to pay for everything ourselves anyway, we would just rather go on our own trip. Once again we just didn't think this was the trip for us.  
  
Before we could tell our in-laws our decision, our in-laws canceled the family trip. My husband and I then decided to move forward with our own vacation.

214,1c6d83y,AITA if my dad and I told my mom to not give away free match tickets to her relatives?,"AITA for asking my dad to stop giving my mom extra cricket match tickets? My dad, an Executive VP at a hospital, gets complimentary terrace tickets for IPL matches. My mom keeps inviting her snobby relatives, who’ve been mean to me. I declined their company and asked my nice aunt to come so I wouldn’t have to be alone with the relatives and my mom. I fear my mom will overshare about my boarding school offer and badmouth it to them. My dad agreed to stop giving away tickets, especially since the relatives are now demanding box tickets they’d never get otherwise. Dad declined their request for box tickets, as he’s already given them thousands worth of free tickets for the tournament which were given first his family but none of us even ended up going. The relatives have also taken tickets for a few matches to watch with their friends or their own other relatives. My dad and I discussed their growing entitlement at length and I told me mom mt dad wont be giving her more free tickets to give away to them, (my dad didn’t want to since he knew it’d cause a fight so I told her, they have fought several times over this entitlement of the relatives) Now, my mom is upset and calls us both AH. And I dunno are we?

Side note: the snobby relatives in question are technically not my direct relatives, the uncle or I call cousin-uncle is my moms maternal cousin, she’s been close with his family since my grandma passed, the nice aunt is my actual aunt and my mom’s sister. The cousin-uncle is bringing his whole family, his I think 18 yr old son and wife, who also seem weirdly cold towards me often. The cousin-uncle in question has fatshamed me with my own mother at his son’s birthday which my mom forced me to go to, called me spoiled on occasions for getting gadgets or things as my birthday gifts, etc. I never get good vibes around his family, feel uneasy and uncomfy around them so I haven’t met them in a bit too, which is why I’m kind of even more worried abt the comments. Both my parents are aware of all this, my dad understands but my mom can’t see past her ‘love’ for my grandma’s side of the family. My grandma was an angel from the little bits I remember of her, but can’t say the same about the rest of the family from her side. My dad can’t come along with me due to prior work commitments and he’ll watch the next match with me on the weekend, in the box, so haha in your face snobby relatives) 


Edit: something I forgot to add, ipl is indian premiere league, a cricket league in India with players from all over the world competing in teams based on states in India, and my dad gets free tickets because he’s been close with the administration of our state home team for a while, (we never went since I wasn’t really that interested in cricket but now I do enjoy watching),and the hospital company where he’s exec VP is the health care partner of that team, they’ve been giving us free tickets since they got to know my dad’s back after having moved to a different city years ago. That’s pretty much all I can think to add if you need more context lmk


Update: I’ve told my mother I’m no longer going, she doesn’t seem to understand why and thinks I’m being dramatic even though I tried to explain it to her for hours the night before. I was looking forward to the match since it’s between my home state’s team and another state team I grew up supporting through my childhood, but I’d much rather stay home and watch from the comfort of it, then being forced to sit 4 hours in a constant uncomfortable situation.

My parents have been charging me rent since I was 16. I have a small company that makes me about $60,000 a year. I started it in high school. It is one of the reasons I graduated early from high school and why I got attention from recruiters. My parents said that since I was earning adult money I could take in adult responsibilities. 

I thought that was fair. So I paid for all my own stuff starting at age 16. Not university. I got a scholarship. And the rent they charged me was minor. $300 a month. 

But I basically considered my room to be completely mine after that. I kept it tidy because I like it that way. But they had no say in when I cleaned it.

They tried to say I was separating myself from the family but I saw it more as having my own schedule. 

This year for spring break I went down to Mexico with friends. My parents were upset because they were hosting a big Easter family get together. 

When I got back they said I was behaving badly by not being around for a family gathering. I said it was my last spring break in university and that I was not responsible for their schedule. 

They said I was grounded and I laughed and said good luck with that. I went to my room and locked the door. They tried banging on it for my attention but I'm done. 

My grandfather came over to talk to me later. He is the one ho helped me get my company started and he is always there for me.

218,1c6bp1s,AITA for asking for a tenancy agreement with my boyfriends parents after the refused to respect my boundaries? ,"I (25F) have lived with my boyfriend (29M) and his parents for the last two years 

Now there’s a few people in this 
My boyfriend (29) we’ll call Jake 
His mum (63) we’ll call Steph 
His dad (67) we’ll call Andrew 

We have a weird house set up- it’s a large house that is essentially split in two (two kitchens on either side, two lounge rooms, and two bedrooms on each side with a glass door separating the two sides on the two floors), It was originally bought when Jake’s grandmother was still alive to provide her privacy in her older age. In May 2023 we found out that I was pregnant, which was a huge shock to us. We both spoke to his parents, who agreed that we would have “nan’s” side of the house (paying rent)  to give us privacy, as we are saving to buy a house 

Once we moved in, Andrew started to nit pick everything we did in “their side of the house”, it hit the point that we were told we weren’t allowed to use the front door and had to use the side entrance through an alley way, as in his words he “ thought we would want privacy”

Once our little one arrived, Steph and Andrew would start walking in without knocking, at any time they liked. I was usually topless on the lounge either feeding or had just fed our baby… so quite vulnerable. On a specific occasion, Steph walked in to talk to me while I was dying my hair (Jake was with baby) in just my bra. Andrew tried to come in, which  Steph stopped and informed him I “wasn’t decent” and not to come in. He straight up said “which side? Left or right? It doesn’t matter if she’s feeding the baby” and attempted to walk in again (which Steph stopped him… again)

I have spoken with Jake and Steph about this a few times and told them I’m not comfortable with people seeing me with my boobs out, and to please knock and wait for a response so I have a chance to cover myself (Andrew is not the type of person you can talk to directly without him blowing up, Steph is able to word it in a way that he can “handle”), yet it continued 

I started to lock the door between the two sides, to try and give myself the privacy I wanted. Jake came home and noticed the door locked. He asked me about it and I told him I kept the door locked in the day as I’m usually topless and they refuse to knock. He immediately went to both his parents and told them

Andrew was pissed that I had done that and said “maybe we should have a tenancy agreement then” which I said was a great idea

Jake said I’m being an asshole for agreeing to that, and that we dont need one 

I think it’s a great idea as it enforces everyones expectations and boundaries. I don’t want to come off as ungrateful, as they have done more for us than we could have imagined, but I shouldn’t have to sacrifice my boundaries for their support 

Am I the asshole? 

EDIT: I thought I would clarify a few things as well 

1. Jake told his parents due to the reaction Andrew would have if he tried to come in and notice the door was locked. I did tell Jake that there were better ways to go about it, which he does agree with. He has been incredibly supportive and defending me regarding the privacy I would like, but thinks a tenancy agreement is disrespectful to his parents and not needed 

2. Andrew isn’t too keen on a baby in the house, and has made a few side comments and remarks throughout my pregnancy about how he didn’t want grandchildren ( yes he’s just an asshole)

3. We are currently paying subsidised rent, as it was mutually beneficial to both sides, if we moved out Steph and Andrew would have to sell the house. The agreement gives us the time to save for a house (as my pay has been cut in half while on maternity leave, and baby shit is expensive) and they don’t need to sell the house sooner than they want to 

FURTHER EDIT: 

For those concerned about our safety, Andrew isn’t and has never been a physically aggressive or violent person. Nor would he ever lay a hand on a woman or child

I said I know that but I don't really want it to get to the point where he tries anything with her. She accused me of not trusting her which I told her was not true. She told me to keep out of it and that I was out of order for telling her how to act around a colleague.

221,1c6ammn,AITA for reporting a teacher for not doing her job?,"So, when I started high school three years ago I met my new Italian and literature teacher. She was young, carefree, loved to talk with us – when she got pissed, she got extremely angry, just to switch again to being pleasant after cracking a joke. Nonetheless, most of the time we adored her. 

In the first year, my impression was that she… was simply not that good at teaching. Don’t get me wrong, she is an expert in her field; yet, whenever we had lesson, she would start seriously, then tell a fun fact, share a personal experience, dive into another argument altogether and then we’d end up with useless information and behind with the schedule.

During the second year we got comfortable with eachother, and she started to teach less and less until, eventually, she gave up. She’d come to class and we’d mind our business, either catching up on other homework or staying on our phones. I was disheartened – I used to love the subject, and by then I wasn’t even learning a thing. 

The third year came, and we have had, at most, eight proper lessons all year round. I was really unhappy with this, and searched for the support of other classmates which didn’t come. They were perfectly content in having a new teacher friend and not having to study. 

Recently, our Latin teacher, who happens to also be the vice-principal, caught up with the horrifying situation, as we didn’t know anything at all of grammar or Italian literature. My family and I thought it was about time to let her know about everything. Of course, the vice-principal had already gotten similar complaints, and the day before she had called my Italian teacher and warned her – there wasn’t anything else she could do, she only advised my mom that, if the situation didn’t change, the students’ parents could ask the principal for my Italian teacher to be replaced.

During Italian lessons you can now cut the tension with a knife, not to mention the sly remarks the teacher makes: for example, we didn’t know something we *supposedly* studied with her last year, and she commented that then it’s us who don’t study, and not her who doesn’t teach. Adding to that, she also bragged about how she’s the only one who offers her hours for civic education, or coordinates the classroom for free – of course, nothing about teaching Italian. 

Just the other day she set up a test to “punish” us, because we supposedly complained she doesn’t make her tests difficult enough, and one of my classmates blew off, saying that it’s not the whole classroom at fault for the complaints, but just a couple odd ones and that it isn’t fair. Everyone seemed to agree. I’ve discussed this with my friends and they say that if the class disagreed on reporting her, my parents shouldn’t have, and I shouldn’t be supporting that cause. 

Well, we actually had lesson these last few days for a change, but I’m starting to rethink my actions. Maybe I’ve only made the situation worse.

222,1c6a7np,AITA for supporting my bestie?,"So, let me spill the tea on this whole situation. I'm a 25-year-old gay guy, and my best friend, let's call him Adam, is 23. We used to work together at a grocery store, living our best lives until Adam started dating this dude, Tim. And let me tell you, Tim was a whole new level of rude. He'd throw shade at Adam in front of everyone, trying to be the class clown by belittling him. It was not a vibe, let me tell you.

Fast forward to one fateful night, we're having a game night and getting lit in the hot tub. Tim excuses himself to the bathroom, and that's when Adam drops the bomb on me - he asks if I like Tim. Trying to keep the peace, I tell Adam, 'I think it's a good temporary relationship.' Spoiler alert: it wasn't temporary.

Cut to a few weeks later, Adam calls me in tears because Tim locked him inside the house until he changed his outfit because, apparently, it was 'ugly.' I tell Adam to do some soul-searching and make the right call for himself.

Time passes, and we have another game night, but this time it's on Zoom. We're all having a blast, except for Mr. Grumpy Pants, Tim. He's sulking in the background with his arms crossed and sunglasses on, indoors at night. Suddenly, Adam's camera goes dark, and when he returns, he reveals that Tim ditched our game night to hang out with his friends. Excuse me, what?

In my drunken stupor, I let it all out. I call Tim out for favoring his friends over Adam and essentially dissing our friendship. I probably said some things I shouldn't have, but hey, blame it on the alcohol, right?

The next morning, I'm sobering up and feeling guilty, so I reach out to Adam to check on him and apologize for my drunken outburst. So, here's the million-dollar question - am I the asshole for standing up for my friend and calling out Tim's BS?",Asshole,2024-04-17,1.0,1.0477448,1,1

last May kayla had gotten into a relationship with another girl (shawna) and it was good at first but as time has went its became very toxic

i tried giving kayla advice about toxic relationships but i have never said anything rude or disrespectful shawna has cheated on her multiple times and kayla has forgiven shawna and they have stayed together still i gave her some advice but never said anything rude or disrespectful.

now i have just recently moved two states away from where i used to live and i dont come into town but once a month i go friday night arrive at midnight and then most time leave saturday afternoon or sunday morning. i have seen her a lot of the time i have came done there i dont talk to kayla as much as i used to because of shawna

kayla isn't allowed to have any social media platforms, kayla isn't allowed to facetime or call me and if we do facetime we are only allowed 10 minutes to talk

kayla doesn't text me but try to start convos with her recently some stuff had gone down with her and kayla went to JDC for about a week. i had no idea i talked to kayla's mom, told her i hoped all was going well.
kayla then finds out that shawna cheated on her again while she was in JDC she decided it was the last time and broke up but still kept talking to her leading her on

kayka would talk to me everyday she got social media back and would facetime me all the time how she can get through this as she was having a hard time. when kayla finally cut ties off she made it a couple days then decided she wanted her back and wanted to get together again.

so i told her how i thought it would be a mistake taking her back but she said she knew that. so kayla got back with shawna. mind you shawna has been very manipulative and gaslights kayla blames shawna's cheating on how she grew up and just a bad person in general

shawna adds me and my new current boyfriend who have been there for kayla everyday. to a group chat on a social media app and starts telling us that kayla choses shawna and to stay out of her life and her business and that it's my fault me and kayla don't talk because i don't text her or see her
and i kinda got out of hand and was saying how is it my fault i'm 5 hours away and you (shawna) re the one who won't let kayla talk to me and we just going back and forth
kayla didn't defend me just said ""ok."" when i told her i didn't want to deal with shawnas drama.

i told kayla i was no longer going to support her relationship if she was going to be with shawna and she just said i get it

224,1c6a4c8,AITA for hanging near the hot tub at a party?,"Me (F) and my boyfriend Jamie (fake name) recently went to a house party with a couple of our friends. We didn’t know there was a hot tub, so we didn’t bring any swimming clothes. Couple hours in, me and him have had maybe two drinks but were still sober. Jamie tells me he’s going off to find his friends: okay, cool, I’ll go hang out with people I know. I wander around for a bit before spotting two of my friends, Kira (F) and Mason (M) in the hot tub. I walk over and make conversation. There are other boys that I didn’t recognize in the hot tub. I ignored them. I took off my shoes, sat on the ledge, and dipped my feet in while talking to Mason and Kira. 

Jamie finds me an hour later and says he wants to go home. I say “okay”, and we leave. The entire drive home (We’re sober!) Jamie looks really irritated and shut down any small talk I tried to initiate. I asked him what was up once we were inside the house. He starts to raise his voice and said it’s not cool that I was at the hot tub. I ask why, and he rants for a little about how there were too many guys, they were all “checking me out”, and that it’s not cheating, but it’s disrespectful towards him for me to be in a hot tub around other guys. 

I talk back and tell him that I wasn’t even inside the hot tub, I was basically fully clothed (a loose dress), and I really only paid attention to my friends, I completely ignored the other guys. He reiterated his point about it being disrespectful and that he felt hurt about it. We both started to get annoyed at this point and decided to just sleep it off and figure it out tomorrow. It’s the next day, I slept in, he’s at the gym, and I’m sitting here starting to wonder if maybe I’m in the wrong.

225,1c69s0m,AITA For Saying No Sometimes,"i hope my post makes sense, my apologies if it does not. So let me set the situation:
My husband: 27 y.o. Has ADHD. Comes from a family where his mother coddled him. He is aware of the fact and is aware that it created his lack of independence. Has gone to therapy for family problems. 
Me: 25 y.o. F. Some say I can be hot-headed. Ive also been told im pretty chill. Get told i “baby” him too much or that i “dont let him do things on his own”. I personally do it because i’m aware that my husband’s ADHD can cause some issues. But i am also aware that it feeds into the lack of independence so at times I don’t help him. 

This morning, we woke to go to work (we work together but i don’t see him 90% of the time) and he prepared our lunch bag (placing what i made the night before into the lunch bag). For the past couple days he has been pouring my iced coffee into my cup as well but he seemed to be bothered by it. This happens quite a lot any time he does something for me/us even though i don’t ask him to. So on our way to work, this was our conversation:
Me: i appreciate you pouring my coffee this morning but don’t do it anymore i can do it myself. 
Him: why?
Me:…just cause
Him: ok but why?
Me: it just seems like you’re bothered by it. You have an attitude about it almost as if you’re forced to
Him: well i dont feel forced, i do it because i want to and because i have time
Me: well then why do you seem bothered by it?
Him:idk
Me: i don’t want to argue. Do you actually not know or are you just saying that because you haven’t thought about it? 

He thinks about it for a bit while im explaining why im just trying to figure it out. 

Him: well, see i think about myself alot (not sure what he meant by this) and i guess i just get frustrated because when you ask me to do stuff i do it, but when i ask you to do something you tell me to do it myself. 

Me: well i didnt ask you to pour my coffee. And yeah i do say that sometimes because you struggle with a lack of independence. And when you ask me to do one something, you get into the habit of asking me to do everything for you. Vs when i ask you to do something, i’m asking you to just do your part because i HAVE to ask you to do your part. (cleaning his side of the room, picking up his clothes, etc.). But even if thats the case, i still do alot for you and us. As a matter of fact i get told to let you do stuff on your own because i baby you too much. 

Him: yeah i guess im just being selfish…

The argument continued. He apologized. But he has apologized for being selfish before yet nothing changes. 
I just think that his version of help is to do kind gestures which i don’t need from him. And my version of help is to do his part in what NEEDS to be done as an adult. AITA for denying his request for help sometimes even though i ask for help too? ",Asshole,2024-04-17,1.0,0.04694413,0,0
226,1c69brb,AITA for not letting my stepdaughter eat the last of one of my son's safe foods?,"My son (6m) is autistic and he is non-verbal with a lot of sensory issues. He has very restrictive eating and his list of safe foods is very low, which is something being worked on with a feeding therapist, but he's struggling through feeding therapy and is not yet at a point where he has many options. In his safe foods are a specific brand of roast potatoes, a type of fruit cups and one type of chicken bites. Very very rarely he will eat something else so we always do our best to have those safe foods on hand and in good supply. But the chicken bites have been unavailable for the last three weeks and for the last two weeks we had some money issues after some trouble with our house. This meant we did not have as much to spend on groceries last week and because of this, I was extra vigilant about making sure the safe foods were secure for my son especially because he doesn't eat a lot regardless so it's important he has something available for him.

My stepdaughter (16f) saw the last of the chicken bites and wanted them for herself. I told her she couldn't have them because her brother needed them. We were running low on other stuff and I needed everything to keep us going until my husband got paid again. My stepdaughter said she didn't care and she wanted them and should have them. I refused to let her have them and offered her something else instead. She complained that she wanted nothing else and I told her she can eat something else but her brother cannot. When my husband got home he backed up my decision and my stepdaughter was so pissed.

She told my husband's parents and then they were pissed. They said I should have let her eat them and encouraged my son to eat something different instead of making her find something else. That she's old enough to get to choose what she eats. They also said I made her hate us more (me and her two siblings). My stepdaughter also told her maternal grandparents (her mom passed away while I was pregnant with my son) and they were furious and said I have no right to stop her and how dare we act like she gives a shit about my kids eating or not eating.

 My stepdaughter has been especially angry since and I sat her down and apologized if I upset her by saying no and she told me I didn't have the right to stop her because I'm not her parent and she doesn't care if my kids starve. We're nothing to her. She told my husband's parents I had tried to talk to her and they rubbed it in more. My husband was furious with his parents and he's still on my side. But I feel so worn down by this.

both unemployed teenagers & go to a club held in a game store, $5 per person once a week. i went for a little while (joined october) before i invited friend to join.

i clearly mentioned the cost of coming every week and, as i knew my friend didnt have much money, offered to pay for him.

2 days ago 
in club's discord server & I'm chatting with another member about item often used in our sessions
 mention that my friend bought one & let friend talk. friend says he bought his for $61 total - enough to pay for 12 sessions of the club for himself. i am shocked as i was under the impression he had no money

i ask why he spent all that money on that item (non essential btw - supplied to us). i ask why he spent all the money on it when he could have paid for entry to the club for the last 6 months. 

him ""did you want me to?""  
me: ""YEAH?"" 
me: ""we've been paying for you because we thought you had no money?""
him: ""bc i didnt at the time, my parents mostly paid for the item and other stuff"".
he directly replies to my previous message: ""how was i supposed to know that

 i say: ""we were talking at school & i said ""oh when you get a job you can start paying your share""

 him: ""ok damn ill pay for myself from now on, didn't know it was such an issue."" 
me: ""im not attacking you no need to get so defensive im js surprised that u didnt know"" conversation ends.

 he dms me. 
him: ""im gonna have to no longer continue to come to [cub] anymore, i talked to my parents about the paying and they refused so until i have a source of income, dw about me coming anymore""

im frustrated with him at this pojnt and respond ""ffs we're still gonna pay for you until you get a source of income that's why we were paying for you.""

him: ""then why did u make it such a big issue in a public space?""
i say he's the one making it an issue & repeat that we are going to still pay for him

him: ""you made it a big issue in the chat, at any point you could have privately dmd me about how much i spent"" 
me: ""we were discussing [club] on the [club] server.""

him: ""no, you were discussing my finances and payment in the server, where its none of their business."" 
i tell him to chill out.

he then sends me a large paragraph..
i spend 15 minutes replying to the points in his paragraph EXCEPT the last one 
 
he flips out and sends another paragraph accusing me of cherry picking when i answered every question minus the last one which was ""have i done something to upset you"" he blocks me before i can reply.

my cousin (24f) recently moved in with me and my mom after a falling out with her boyfriend. for context, she lived with us for years when she was younger & we kind of grew up together. there have been issues here & there but generally everything has been okay. she also happens to work for this family member as they prefer family to be there as oppose to strangers. 


recently, shes been on a gym craze and is very hyperfixated on her health. she goes to the gym in the morning monday through friday. she showers before she goes which honestly i dont really understand because i know a lot of people shower after instead, but to each their own. she takes the bus there, so i suppose she has to wake up even earlier to get there at her desired time. 


the issue is that her gym schedule aligns with me coming home in the morning. before she was living here, i always immediately showered in the morning as soon as i woke up before even looking at my phone. i think its fair for me to want to shower as soon as i come home in the morning, but shes usually already in there when i get home. my mom wakes up pretty early to go to work, and i know my mom probably wakes her up with all the noise (she sleeps on the coach) so i dont get why she doesnt at least start her showers earlier, she seems to be just getting in when i get home. i really dislike having to just sit in my room and wait for her to be done, it feels a bit ignorant of her. she also takes really long showers, shes been in there the entire time ive been typing this lol. i guess ideally she would let me go first before she gets ready for the gym, as im not really the type of person to take long showers. to be completely transparent i dont have anywhere to go afterwards whereas she does (the gym). she works overnights for the same person just like i do, and she usually immediately comes home to shower so i think its understandable for me to want to do the same. im not sure if shes aware what shes doing, but wibta if i asked her to let me shower first? knowing her, she gets irritated pretty easily so ive been postponing talking to her about it. how would i even bring this up? its a pretty first world problem, i know.

231,1c68qyc,AITA for telling my mother to stop getting smart with my 11 yr old daughter?,"For backstory: Me and my 11 yr old daughter, we will call her Shaina, live with my parents. My daughter is starting puberty and is bullied in school. About 6 weeks ago I had to take Shaina to the therapist bc she was on school computers looking up ways to harm herself. She was also cutting herself.

Things were starting to get better, but she failed 2 classes this marking period and got smart with her teacher about the extra credit I told her to ask for before the marking period ended. So, I grounded her, only can do schoolwork, or read a book. No computer, phone or TV. 

Now, in the midst of me ""yelling"" at her and grounding her. My mother, who has stage 4 metastatic breast cancer, and is dieing, told my daughter, ""You're gonna kill me"". I immediately said, no she isn't, don't say that. She tried to say that's not what she meant. 

Today is 3 days later and my mom has done nothing but get smart with Shaina. Anytime Shaina says anything, my mom tells her to be quiet or gets a smart ass attitude with her. Like, she isn't even allowed to speak. 
Now, as I see it, I'm Shainas mother and it is my duty to protect her, that includes from my own mother, her grandparent. So, this morning I told my mom to stop with the smart mouth towards Shaina. She said, but I'm mad at her and I said I don't care, there's no reason to speak to her like that. 
My mother snapped, we had a little argument. About how she's treating everyone like shit lately. She says that's bc we treat her that way first, but we literally don't. We get her her meds, we take her to chemo, we make sure she has what she needs and we get upset with her when she doesn't listen to the doctor. That's what she's talking about. She's mad that people are telling her what to do. She says she's 60 years old and no1 can tell her what to do, but then expects to tell everybody what to do for her. 

This morning was I guess a culmination of all this shit. She's mad at me and refusing to take her morning meds. Apparently I'm a bitch and I'm not supposed to speak to my mother in any other way but complete and utter respect. She talks about how her mother wasn't loving and she would never talk back to her mother. I'm not talking back to my mother, I am defending my child from another bully, that happens to be my mother. I have felt for years that my mother is a narcissist. If she doesn't get her way, she gets mad, will literally throw a tantrum, go to her room, slam the door and ignore everyone. She's done that bc her food was wrong when delivered. All that is besides the point. I would just like yall to tell me if I was being an asshole, I don't think I was. I'm sure my dad will take my mom's side, he always does. My sister will see both sides and we don't even bother my brother with shit like this. I always read these posts and you guys are brutally honest and I need that. Thanks in advance yall.

232,1c68pj9,AITA for making the Age of Empires 2 'new villager' sound when my wife gave birth to our first child?,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.

Just over a week ago, my wife gave birth to our first child. I got called about it during work and rushed to the hospital to be with her during the labour. It was obviously a very stressful time, as it took more than 15 hours from start to the end, but finally our little one was born and was healthy.

I was in the room for nearly the entire time (other than briefly heading out for food, toilet etc), holding her hand and being the 'punching bag' as she swore during certain times during the worst of it. As it was getting towards the end, just as the head was coming out (and it all happened very quickly from then), more medical staff came into the room and I am someone who gets nervous around lots of people. I think because of that nervousness, I was talking a bit more, introducing myself to the new people coming in, making jokes (saying I hope it's not a bad omen that the weather is so bad, because a thunderstorm had started outside that we could hear) and then when our baby finally came out fully, at that second, I made the Age Of Empires 2 'new villager' sound (""Shhhh hoooh"") as a joke, but I think only my wife understood the reference (as the doctor and nurses gave no reaction) and the look she gave me could have sunk a thousand ships, she looked so so angry, before then seeing our little one and finally smiling (but didn't look at me for about half an hour, and even then she was really annoyed for the rest of the day).

Anyway, I thought it was a joke that went down badly in a moment of high anxiety, but my wife has twice in the past week told me that I ruined a moment that she hoped would be one of the best in her life. I've apologised both times, but she has this look I've not seen before, something beyond disappointment. It's really put a downer on the past nine days of what I thought would be our happiest time together, after what was obviously a very stressful time (for her mostly, of course).

This weekend my brother was home from uni and was going out with some friends, and he decided to wear my old dress. Seeing him wear it made me so uncomfortable about my body, I missed being able to wear that dress and a lot of my old clothes.  
  
I asked him to wear something else but he told me that it was the only going-out clothes he had packed since he was only back for the weekend. We argued more and I told him it was my dress and I didn't want him to wear it, he told me that I had given it away and it was his now, he also brought up how the dress wouldn't fit me now anyway, he didn't say it rudely, more a matter of fact way but it still hurt.  
  
After my brother left I went to our mother and asked her to tell my brother to stop wearing my old clothes around me, she was on my side and talked to my brother when he got back and my brother got really upset, but did as he was told and didn't wear any of my old things he had, but he was clearly upset with our mother and me, so now im wondering, AITA?",Asshole,2024-04-17,1.0,0.56396085,1,1
235,1c66wav,AITA for changing my FIL's house rules while taking care of his children?,"I'm 28 years old and my husband is 29. My FIL has three children (7, 12 and 14 year old) from his second marriage. He is currently divorced with his children's mother and the way they divided care is that every two weeks the children change parents.

FIL is a lazy and egocentric parent. He demands a lot from the children, without doing much himself. He basically acts like feeding and driving them to after-school activities is care. He doesn't have a real job, so not only they don't have a stable income, but also he is a terrible example to the children. He was even worse when ~~FIL~~ **edit: husband** was little.

Last month FIL had an emergency and had to leave for a few weeks. The children's mother also had plans, so he asked my husband and I and we agreed to take care of the kids for two weeks.

On the first day I already realized that those kids are overwhelmed and have way too much on their plate, which causes them to be constantly behind on their duties and makes them more prone to try and wriggle out of some. Each had multiple chores assigned on top of walking the dog, school stuff, after-school activities and private lessons (they are already failing at school and need private tutors).

I sat them down, explained that I get, that they have a certain way of doing things around the house, but for the next two weeks it's my house, my rules. Which are:

1. Their main responsibilities are school related. Just like me and husband go to work every day, they go to school and work hard there. I expect them to be in charge of their homework, try and complete it on their own, but be able to recognize when something is too difficult and tell us, so that we can resolve it together. I also expect them to be aware of and responsibly manage their time.
2. In terms of house chores, since we are the adults, we will take care of most.
3. We will walk the dog together, unless someone is busy with something.
4. Once they are done with everything, they can do whatever they want.

Honestly, the two weeks went super smoothly. Not gonna go into details because word count, but It was great.

It stopped being great when the two weeks ended and the kids went to their mum, and then back to dad's. FIL called my husband and accused us of pitting them against him, because apparently now they question his every command, that his authority got undermined and that we had no right to do this and that he's going to have a hard time with them now.

I get where he's coming from, but also 1) his rules were terrible and I would feel terrible imposing them 2) I feel like when you're leaving your children or pets with someone, you have to realize, that some things will end up being done differently. FIL doesn't have many other people who would be willing to take care of his children for so long, and he's bound to need us at least a few more times before they're grown, so the sooner he realizes that, the better. 

However, a few family members have already declared their support for him, so maybe I'm being too confident? AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-17,0.0,0.15790093,0,1
236,1c66ewb,AITA for banning my parents from a family event because they don’t like my brother’s wife?,"So my (30F) little brother is 23. I have another brother that’s 20 but this is about the 23 year old who I will call Blake.


A few months ago, Blake eloped with his girlfriend Shay (19F). Our parents and my three sisters (Mary 22F, Bea 27F and Sarah (25F)) were LIVID. Like unusually angry. I was a little confused but I spoke to him and to me it seemed like he and his girlfriend loved each other very much and just made the rash decision to elope in Vegas. We live about 3 hours from Vegas so it’s a popular day trip destination so they were there for the day and eloped. Like yeah it was a little silly but I don’t understand why they’re so angry about it. Blake and Shay didn’t even tell anyone about their marriage until 2 months later. 

Blake and Shay are a very wholesome and dare I say, perfect couple. They very obviously love eachother, live together and split the bills, both study very good degrees and have two cats. I’ve always said you can’t put a timeline on life if they wanna do marriage earlier than usually, who cares? 

My parents have made a point to not invite Shay to any family events since. They’ll call up Blake and say ‘don’t bring your girlfriend’ (they refuse to acknowledge the marriage). Blake came the first two times they did this but left very early, and he’s always politely declined all invitations since then. I’ve tried to tell my parents that they are pushing Blake away and soon they can expect to never hear from him again but they don’t seem to care. They take every opportunity to insult Shay even though they used to love her before the elopement. 

It’s my son’s birthday soon and I’m planning a big party.

I sent the guest list in a family GC and my parents saw that shay was invited. They demanded that she’s taken off but i refused. They were acting in a way that made me suspect they were going to make a scene there so I banned them. I don’t want them to isolate my younger brother and he hasn’t been to any family events since he got married besides the 2 he left early. 

They are infuriated. They are threatening to show up anyway and think I have no right to ban them for someone ‘who isn’t part of the family’. My sisters and youngest brother think i am overreacting and I could have instead warned them to behave and told them they would be removed if they couldn’t do so. They think the ban is nuclear. My parents are demanding an invite and an apology. AITA?

237,1c658t3,AITA for speaking to my SILs case worker on behalf of her former foster child which got the child removed from SIL and her husband's care?,"My SIL (husband's older sister) and her husband (my husband's BIL) are foster parents. From November of last year to February of this year they had a foster daughter ""Mae"". Mae was in foster care because her mother was addicted to drugs and was deemed unfit and unsafe for Mae to continue living with her. Mae is 13. She was removed from her mom at the age of 10 and does still have visits with her mom. Mae loves her mom. This was clear from day one of her moving into SIL's house. SIL and her husband were not understanding of Mae loving her mom. They would actively discourage her from wanting more access to her mom. Mae was writing letters to her mom and they read those and asked her why she would give up any stable home to go back to a dangerous life. It was so difficult for Mae and she reported SIL and her husband to the case worker but the case worker didn't trust what Mae was saying.

SIL and her husband would say these things around my husband, myself and their extended family. I am also a former foster child and a child of an addict and I 10000% understand Mae. So I attempted to explain to SIL and her husband that they were not helping Mae by disparaging her mom and that many foster kids love and miss and want their parents and being an addict doesn't change that. SIL told me it was none of my business and they did not want me to interfere again. Mae heard me speak to them and she opened up about how unhappy she was with my SIL and her husband and how frequent their disparaging comments about her mom or discouragement of her loving her mom happened. She was feeling so desperate and said they didn't get it.

My husband told SIL she should be more open to hearing my experiences as a foster child but she told him I was not Mae and she did not want her kids loving awful parents.

My husband and I spoke about what happened and he encouraged me in reaching out to the case worker and explaining what was happening. This led to Mae being removed from SIL and her husband's care. SIL knew it had been me/us immediately. My husband attempted to take all the blame but SIL said she knew it was me. She told me I had taken away Mae's stability again and how dare I interfere when I was told to stay out of it. The rest of my husband's family said we should have kept out of it and it really wasn't any of our business. My husband told them it was wrong what his sister and her husband were doing to Mae. But they all believe I was too close to the background to understand it was not my place.

239,1c6562x,AITA for refusing to go to my grandmother's funeral?,"I(34f) lost my father at the age of seven and subsequently lost all contact with his side of the family.

I mostly only know my moms side of the story because of my young age at the time but basically I know that they really didn't like my mom (they think it's her fault that he died --re: his depression and alcoholism after their separation) and they were pretty racist (upset that my dad married and had children with an Indigenous person). 

I remember some efforts on their part being made in the beginning but ultimately I think my siblings and I fell victim to a battle between adults. Years went by before any contact resumed. At this point I was older (a teenager) and interested in reconnecting but all of my efforts left a bad taste in my mouth. A few examples include:


My grandmother called our house once and I picked up (she was notorious for drunk calling my mom and leaving hateful messages). She went on for hours crying and speaking badly about my mom. I was only 10 at this point so it was wildly inappropriate.

I tried adding them on social media and they rejected (claiming that if I wanted to talk to them I could call)

I saw my aunt at a store and felt shy to say anything. I later heard she went around calling me a bitch for ignoring her (again, I'm still quite young at this point)

We went to my grandfather's funeral and they spent the whole time talking badly about my mom and doting on my brother (my sister and I couldn't help but feel like it was because he inherited more Caucasian features like my dad, while we look like our mom) 


Flash forward to now, and my grandmother recently passed away. We've been aware that she was sick for quite some time but I've reach a point in my life where these people are strangers to me so it didn't feel natural to visit her in her final days or attend her funeral. 

My aunt and cousin have attempted to contact me (invite me to the funeral, offer me memorabilia from her house) but I just don't see why I would be a part of this when I wasn't a part of her life when she was alive.

240,1c655k3,AITA for refusing to let my son stay over his grandparents place for the summer?,"A little backstory:

I (23F) had a forced marriage (technically arranged but i felt like I couldn’t say no) at 18. I was very mentally ill and my dad just wanted to get rid of me essentially.

I had my son before my 19th birthday and due to my mental illness and how my in laws treated me, I never bonded with him. They were a constant presence in my home with my ex husband and barely let me have my own son and I had no support from anyone since I was in a new country. I filed for divorce a few months later and my ex husband won custody of my son because he was a man in his 20s with a stable job and I was a mentally ill girl with no means to look after this child. 

After this, I moved back to my mothers country (she never approved of the marriage but was unable to help due to being abroad and other factors) and I wasn’t allowed to call/visit my son. 

On to the issue: 
A few months ago, I got a call from my father. I don’t speak to him because of the marriage he forced me into so I was surprised to hear from him. Turns out my ex was no longer able to care for our son (he married a woman who didn’t want to be a step mother) and they wanted to know if I could take him. I said yes, and a few weeks later my little boy was in my home and I had him enrolled in school. It took me a while to get his citizenship sorted but it’s finally been done. As it stands legally in my country, I have sole custody. In my son’s country of birth, my ex has also registered with the necessary officials to let them know he has given up my son to me and I have full custody over there too. 

It took us a few weeks to get used to each other but he was already calling me mom and telling me he loved me very early on. I took time off work to get to know him better and we are inseparable.

It’s nearing summer and his grandparents (my ex in laws) have been asking me to send him to them for the summer. I refused for three reasons:

 1) They were a big part in why I lost him in the first place. Imagine being newly post partum, recovering from a horrifying birth experience and not being allowed to hold your own baby and having NO ONE to turn to. Everyone who cared about me was in my mother’s country. 

2) They might not let me have him back and then I’ll have to sue and it will be very expensive and traumatic.

3) I asked him if he wanted to see them and he said he wanted to stay with me. 


I passed this information on to them and they’re going mad. I’m being harassed on social media and my family back in their country is blowing up my phone. My ex is also telling me that the only reason he gave my son to me instead of his parents was because he promised them they would still be allowed to see him. They’ve all been saying i’m an asshole for refusing to let them see my son but I don’t think I’m wrong given my reasons. I suggested they come visit us and I would even let them stay in my home but they have refused. AITA?

241,1c64pqi,AITA For not introducing myself to my new boyfriends niece and nephew ,"I have been dating my boyfriend for 4 months and I recently found out from him that his sister in law is upset with me. 
Some context, I do not speak to my family much because in my expirence family can be summed up in a word, dramatic. However my boyfriend is big on family. So to be with him I have to get over my preferred solitary lifestyle. I like to stay quiet and stick to the sidelines. 
My boyfriends mom doesn't like me much, turns out it's because his sister in law has been telling her stuff about me. Why? Because I did not introduce myself to her 4yr old daughter and 6yr old son when they were playing in the neighbors yard.
I've only saw his sister In law in our first month. And in that time I've seen her twice, in those times we only said two sentences to eachother and those were greetings. 
The first time her kids were playing in the neighbors yard and the second time one of her kids soiled themselves and they had to rush home. Great times to introduce one's self (I am being sarcastic).
In my experience mothers are territorial guards. I'm thinking as a mom I would not want adults walking up to my children introducing themselves without asking me first. I'd want to know that persons character, if they are safe and know how to conduct themselves in front of children. His sister in law is acting like I should just walk up, enter someone elses property (the neighbors i havent even met) approach HER kids bend down in their faces like HI KIDS IM YOUR UNCLES GIRLFRIEND WHATS YOUR NAMES. Heck no. 
She should have spoke to me, got to know me a bit, and introduced me with the title she felt I deserved when introducing them to me so that the kids felt comfortable. Instead she's been putting her two cents into everything that has to do with my relationship with my boyfriend and telling his mother nonsense when she does not even know me. 
These women don't even know my last name, I barely go outside, and they've never gotten passed a greeting or comment about the weather and  yet they've got stories to tell about me. BRUV HOW?!

242,1c64nln,"AITA for being upset and declining my roommates’ suggestion that I pay more rent and keep the shared bathroom expenses separate because they happen to share one bathroom, while I use another alone?","My 2 roommates and I, whom we met online and teamed up with, moved into this 3-bed 2-bath apartment this month.

I'm the one who found this apartment and divided the rent based on room sizes: I pay $1340, while the other two pay $1304.50 each since my room is slightly bigger. We all agreed on this before signing the lease and paid the first month's rent and security based on this arrangement.

We have 2 full bathrooms. A slightly larger one with a window near the 2 roommates' rooms, and a smaller one w/o a window near mine. Naturally out of convenience, the 2 roommates use the larger bathroom near their rooms, while I use the smaller one near mine.

But after 16 days of living here, the roommates believe that I basically have the smaller bathroom all to myself and it's not fair. They're suggesting that I should exclusively have this smaller bathroom and pay more rent, as well as keep the shared cost for bathroom amenities separate. I want to emphasize again that this bathroom arrangement occurred out of convenience. I never prevented them from using this particular bathroom.
I agreed to splitting the shared bathroom expenses separately as a compromise, but the roommates are pushing me to have a private bathroom and pay more rent.

I earn the lowest income out of the 3 of us, with one roommate making nearly 3x my salary. Despite this I've willingly covered the costs of communal items like cleaning supplies, toilet brushes for both bathrooms, a window screen for the bathroom I don't use, a ladder, dish soaps, paper towels, and toilet papers, all out of my own pocket (all high quality too). Yet, it's as though the roommates have no concept of pitching in or helping out; everything has to be split equally. 

I firmly declined and even expressed that I was offended, but they want to revisit the discussion next week.
So AITA here?


TLDR:

1. We have 2 full baths in our apartment. 2 roommates use the one near their bedrooms, while I use the other one near my room out of convenience.

2. The roommates believe I practically have a private bathroom and suggest that I should pay more rent, in addition to keeping the shared bathroom expenses separate for fairness.

3. I refused and I'm mad because we agreed on the rent division based on bedroom sizes before signing the lease and have already paid the first month's rent and security accordingly. I never claimed the bathroom as mine but they're trying to change the agreement to suit their needs.

Both bathrooms are located in the hallway; there are no ensuite bathrooms.

As you can see my bedroom is isolated from the rest of the unit. The roommates' bedrooms and larger bathroom are hidden around the corner on the opposite side. It makes sense for me to use the smaller bathroom since it's the closest and first accessible bathroom, while the roommates would naturally do the same in the one closer to their bedrooms.

IMO the larger bathroom is better when you compare the two since it's more spacious, has a window for better ventilation and brightness, and came with a shower head. The smaller bathroom was in rough shape but I took the time to fix it up, installed a shower head, and gave it a thorough deep clean because I use this bathroom every day and I just like my space clean.

By the roommates' logic we aren't really sharing both bathrooms because they store their shower items in the larger one, while I keep mine in the smaller one.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-17,0.0,0.029401055,0,1
243,1c64n4z,WIBTA if I buy a house that doesn't meet my partner's requirements?,"My partner of 6 yrs and I currently live in a townhouse that I own, that feels very cramped/cluttered. 

Originally, I had a bedroom and two guests rooms one which doubled as an office which worked very well for me.  (I'm not from here, and used to have friends and family that visited fairly regularly).

Before moving in we both sold, donated and thrown out lots of stuff, but our 18' x 28' townhouse still feels very cramped. 

I am here basically 22/7 and the house is just not meeting my needs. And ecstatically leaves me feeling trapped/confined. Like I get bruises from our footboard if I don't walk around my bed carefully.  

My partner likes where we are because he has a small workshop and he uses one of the three rooms as a walk in closet for his suits (he works a  uniform job) but they look great on him.
We share the master bedroom, and the third bedroom is kind of a guest bedroom, my clothes, etc. My office is kind of in the living room/dining room. There is zero floor space for exercise. 

I want to buy a house. He contributes $700 to the household and had previously agreed to contribute $1100 if I buy a bigger place. He does not want to be a homeowner. 

He said he was open to moving, but basically only if he doesn't lose his change room, he gets a workshop, the new house is  not too far from work. 

I would like a freehold house, built after 1986 (asbestos). I would like a guest room so I can have friends and family stay, An office (with a Murphy bed so it can be a second guest room -big family), a soak tub.  More than one bathroom. Floor space so I can exercise. And newer roof/furnace/windows are a definite plus!

I want a place I'm proud of. I've looked for years, and I just can't find a home that meets all his expectations and mine AND that fits within my budget. 

I told him I couldn't afford a 4 bedroom (master/his closet room/office/guestroom) house with a workshop, close to his work.

I suggested a 3 bedroom with walkin closet and he could have the walkin closet. That was a no. 

 I asked if he could choose between the two and he tells me it's hard and unfair that he should have to lower his standards. And it's more fair if he gets a room and I get a room.

He's response is to tell me I shouldn't need to have a room for guests. That he lives there all the time. We should get them hotels.

But he's not willing to buy a house with me and if I'm spending all this money I feel like I should get a better situation, not just the same situation in a more expensive home that I'll be paying a mortgage/property tax/insurance, emergency and routine repairs on. 

To be fair He hates change and he hates moving. 

His last place he had a bedroom, a suit room/closet then too, and the living-dining room was their workshop (which he didn't /doesn't use that often).

He's a very good and supportive boyfriend for reasons outside this post. We love each other deeply. This is just something we're struggling through.

I have chores just like my siblings. But something I do for fun and because I love and have a passion for it is cooking. I started cooking for myself 3 years ago. I had cooked before but nothing like the last three years. I enjoy making my own breakfast and dinner and even lunch if I have no school. My parents saw I was cooking more and they added that to my list of chores because mom said they didn't want to waste food and dad said it was rude to cook for only one person. And I didn't mind cooking for everyone. But they were so fucking ungrateful. My siblings and parents alike.

Complaints I got were: Too spicy, wanted potatoes instead of rice, wanted rice instead of noodles, wanted beef instead of chicken, wanted something plain instead of spicy, wanted no veggies, wanted a more veggie focused meal, wanted lasagna instead of pasta bake, didn't want soup, didn't like the flavor of soup, didn't want something sweet, wanted something sweet, changed mind and wanted meat well done, wanted more kinds of potatoes and the list goes on.

None of this was constructive either. It was whining and complaining and I did start out asking what I should do but everyone wanted something different and I'm still in school!! I can't spend 6 hours cooking dinner on a school night so my siblings can have pizza, fries, nuggets, tacos and my parents can have steak and potatoes and gravy and all the trimmings or none of the trimmings but five different kinds of potatoes. I even made a weekly meal plan for a while and they wouldn't complain until after they ate it.

I spoke to my family about the way they were behaving and my mom told me that's the reality of cooking for a family. She said my siblings and dad had always been like that with her. I pointed out I hadn't been and she just said that and she said yeah but it's part of life. I told her so she decided to treat me worse than I treated her and she told me I was being difficult and I told her no, she was taking everyone else's behavior out on me.

246,1c63ys0,AITA for telling my grandparents to stop dragging me into stuff between them and my dad?,"My grandparents in this post are my dad's dad and his dad's second wife. My grandma has been in my dad's life since he was a kid but he doesn't like her and he doesn't count her as his family or his parent. He was always open about that with me and asked me to respect that like he respects that I consider both grandpa and her to be my grandparents (as well as granny who is his late mom). So I respect that. I no he has no love for grandma and merely tolerates her overall mostly for my grandpa but also because my siblings and I have a good relationship with her.

So what's the issue?

Well, I was selected by my school for a project where we're highlighting the different kinds of families and I was asked to do something to explain mine. It could be a family tree, a collage, a piece of personal writing but I chose to mix a collage with pieces of writing and I explained my family structure the best I could. I also touched on the relationship between my dad and my grandparents and how grandma is my grandma but not my dad's mom and how granny is my dad's mom and all three are my grandparents.

My grandparents really didn't like it. Grandma said it was unnecessary to add that information in. I told them it was the way our family is and she told me it wasn't because whether dad likes it or not, she's been his second mom since he was 6 years old. I told her that's not how he sees it and I'm not going to disrespect him by ignoring the fact granny is the only person he considers his mom. Grandma asked why I was okay with disrespecting and diminishing her and then grandpa said I should fix it like they suggested and let dad see it and let him see that I also think he's wrong to reject and deny grandma being anything to him. I told them I wouldn't do it.

They started a fight with dad over it. They said he should be well past the point of not accepting grandma. Grandpa asked him what happens if he dies first and she's the only parent he has left. And I guess he told them he's the last parent regardless and he doesn't have to have a relationship with her again if grandpa goes first.

So then my grandparents came back to me and told me about this and they told me I really needed to intervene and I'm such a thoughtful young man and shit. I told them to stop dragging me into stuff between them and dad because I had already said no and I wasn't going to fight with dad for them and he taught me very early that nobody can force relationships on us and I wasn't going to do that to him.

They told me I was very disrespectful to them and that I was old enough to want my family to be happy and to call out bad behavior and injustice in families.

247,1c63vop,AITA for telling my roommate not to clean his shoes in the sink,"Our apartment’s fire alarm went off, so my roommates and I went for a walk until we could go back inside the building—we ended up walking past some train tracks and one of my roommates stepped in mud. Their legs got coated about halfway up his shins.

He tried to rinse his shoes off with what water he had in a water bottle outside just to not leave tracks anywhere as we got back to our room. This kind of worked, but once he slipped them back on, they of course got dirty again.

Anyways, once we got back to our apartment he tried to insist that he use the kitchen sink to rinse off his shoes. I told him to just go use his bathroom sink/shower since we had dishes in the sink and there’s no sense in covering it all in mud, dirt, and whatever bugs along with it. I feel like that’s kind of gross and unsanitary, and it wouldn’t have been a big deal for him to just use his bathroom instead. He said it wouldn’t be a big deal because he’d be the one to clean the kitchen sink and would make sure no dirt was left, but later gave up, scoffing and rolling his eyes before leaving to go to his room. 

I’m pretty sure he ended up using the kitchen sink anyways as after I went to my room to take a shower, I came back to him cleaning the sink and dishes with Clorox bleach spray. 


I know this isn’t a huge deal, I just feel like I wasn’t making a big request for all the trouble it caused. I’ve already apologized to him as I think I came across as too demanding for the circumstance. AITA?

248,1c63ujq,AITA for demanding credit?,"So, long story short: I hosted a bridal shower for my cousin. I paid for most of it. (80%a alone).  When it came to social media posts- the bride REposted this other girl that only spent 50$ on it. Nothing of my part was mentioned. 

This other  girl let’s call her X initiated it by msging everyone individually to come, and she helped with decor, she got everyone there. She acted like she planned the entire thing when all she did for decor was be in charge of the games and add 3 candles. Cost was 50$ total. She wouldn’t give me the numbers of any of the girls either or start a group chat so I could communicate with any of the girls. 

I paid for the cake, booked the venue, flowers, and balloons. I spent 800$. 

Instead of messaging X, I msged the bride and asked if she would give me a special mention in her post. 

Bride said I was being drama since I msged her and that X is so peaceful and a better friend since she didn’t bother the bride and didn’t stress the bride out with this petty drama. 

So, at that point I messaged the girl and said if you’re going to post you hosted something when you paid the least amount for it could’ve mentioned those who helped out as a decent human. 

Bride  also called me drama. I got disinvited to the wedding.X blocked me.

I know this wedding Isn’t about me, I didn’t mean to ruin anything for the wedding and create drama, but I value my money and expect credit when I spend my time and money on something.

At the beginning of the school year she used to bring a guy and she would make him sleep in the dorm which means I could hear everything. They would stay up talking all night long and I could hear them kissing as well . This happened for weeks, until she got into a fight with him and now they don’t talk anymore.

She stopped talking to him but now she has another man who she used to bring into the dorm, she however stopped sleeping in this room and went to sleep with him in his dorm ever since. 2 days ago she brought him back (he still has his own dorm here) and they won’t stop kissing every second and getting up and talking which keeps me awake. Not only that but the bf sleeps w/out shirt or pants and I just came in and I see his clothes thrown on my side of the room.

250,1c62qbv,AITA for calling him a selfish and controlling ah?,"Background: I 47F and my ex bf, I'll call him David (51M) broke up a little over 10 years ago but remained in contact. We lived together for 6 years before I ended things.

Now, onto the present, I was laid off from my job last August and in the same month was evicted from my apartment (for July's rent). My job was not paying enough, I would have to combine two paychecks to pay it, I would do gig work and still was not making enough to make the difference. After eviction, I and my pets lived in my car and moved to another state a couple of months later for a job. I worked that job for a few weeks but became ill with pneumonia and my car's water pump went out. I did not have enough money for repairs and Uber & Lyft were $60 each way- which I could not afford. I was sleeping in the cold with no money, my ex came and brought me back to his state.  I purchased another vehicle for $300 with my final paycheck. The first week of January his transmission went out on his vehicle.

David does gig work full time and told me he makes about $800+ per week.

Here is the problem, anytime I need or want to use my vehicle he gets a major attitude and throws a tantrum. I have told him let me use the car on what he said are the slowest days for him Mon-Wed so that I can make some money doing gig work as well until a job comes through. He has made that an issue as well. So I sit here in his motel room for 7 days a week since January. Anytime I have an interview he sighs and complains about how much money he is losing by taking me. Anytime I tell him I need a day to myself he turns it into an argument.  He will buy me any items from the store or personal toiletries that I need.

I am tired of this, I want to make my own money. If I continue to be dependent I can never leave. The objective was for me to stay temporarily until I got back on my feet and leave. Every single time we get into it about me telling him he needs to share it turns into an argument and how he feels attacked. He knows since I don't have anywhere to go. 

I had an interview a few months ago out of state (the job market here is beyond awful), before I scheduled it I made sure it was a good time for him to drive me. He said yes, the day of the interview he showed up to the room late claiming his account was in the negative. He never apologized and I told him I believe he deliberately sabotaged me and he didn't say anything.

Tonight, we got into it again, same issue, I said I need a break from the 4 walls other than riding with him to help him on his shops or to the laundromat. I just want to drive and just be alone for an hour to try to make some of my own money, it turned into how he's offended and he feels attacked. I am really starting to hate this guy. I told him that me basically asking him to share should not turn into an argument and that he is a selfish asshole. He is giving me the cold shoulder.

251,1c629n9,AITA: I called out my younger cousins behavior and my sister thinks I did too much.,"My younger cousin (M, 13) usually sleeps at my house throughout the weekdays since his parents and brother cannot take him to school. Last week, he missed a whole week of school because he had a cold, so we did not have him over. This week, he felt better, so they brought him over this Sunday so we could take him to school on Monday. We are always very welcoming when he comes over. This is his second home; he can grab snacks whenever possible. I (M, 19) even let him play my video games when he wants. I noticed his attitude was not great this week, but I just took it that he had a difficult week. 

  
Today, I let him play my video games as he typically asks for when he comes over, and I noticed that his behavior was the worst it had been all week. While playing, he was saying some bigoted and sexist things. While this happened, I kept trying to redirect him and call out his behavior. However, he would ignore me or give me attitude.

  
My sister came to my room, and I tried to move on. I started having a separate conversation with my sister when he asked about a person we were talking about. I asked him who he was referring to since we discussed multiple people. This seemed to have set him off, and he raised his voice, saying how dumb I was for not knowing who he was talking about. At this point, I had enough of his attitude and told him, ""What is with your attitude this week? If you keep acting like this, I'm not going to let you play for the rest of the week"". There was then a long period of silence, and then he left.

  
Once I made sure he made his way to his room, I spoke to my sister about his poor attitude this week and gave her some details of the things he has been saying, such as comments about women and their bodies, saying things like women are dumb. He also spoke poorly about black people and other minorities. He also seemed to be fixated on talking poorly about his new classmates (who are migrants from South America) and always mentioned that they were ""Illegals."" 

  
I then told her that this was ironic since he was making fun of girls for their bodies and their intellect when he was morbidly obese and was failing three of his classes. I also mentioned how it is ironic how he is being fixated on his new classmates and their situation when he is Latino himself and both his parents are undocumented. I finished by saying that it is also odd that he is racist since he is a darker-skinned Latino and is very much indigenous. 

  
My sister told me that while this is true, I did go too far when I called him out. She mentioned that he is still a kid and is unaware of many of these things. She kept repeating this and talking about how he might not want to come over because of the way I responded.

Anyway I was in my room doing my school work when my sister ( 27F) came in and I had told her that I drew some artwork of clothes at school, I was just so excited I wanted to tell someone about it. She said to show her after I finished my schoolwork so I did. After a while when I went upstairs I quietly showed her the photos of my drawings on my phone but she ended up yelling that I was so good and that my mom should see it. I ended up saying “no it’s really not necessary” and I  walked off. She told me that I was very disrespectful bc my mom ended up wanting to see my artwork but I just told her that I won’t show my art to my mom. Instead of asking me why she just labeled me as an asshole and as disrespectful which did start an argument. I told her that it’s my choice on who I want to show my art to and I’m not going to show my artwork to someone that called my artwork worthless, useless and bad. I then told her “if you gave some food to ur friend that u worked so hard on would u send them more food or would you stop?” She said that it wasn’t the same because this is my mom and it’s alright if she said that to me. I told her that it doesn’t even matter who said it to me bc I always put effort into my drawings so her saying that does hurt. In fact her being my mom and saying that is even worse bc as a mom you should always be encouraging your children to always do their hobbies and to never quit. Respect should be given from both sides so why would I show my art to someone who said that it was horrible and not a good quality and that I should just quit? I then told my sister “if I were to say something bad about one of moms hobbies you would be the first one to call me disrespectful, so why am I disrespectful when I CHOSE not to show her my artwork?” She just stayed silent but after a while said that it’s not the same and that I should be respectful to her bc she’s my mom. I told her that respect goes both ways and that I’ll never show something I love to someone that disrespected it. She just stared at me and said ok. I’m always showing off my art to my friends/family for criticism and advice but when someone straight up says degrading things about me and my art work then I just tend to stop showing them.

253,1c61j1a,AITA for not letting my parents drive my children around?," I have 4 year old and an 8 month old. In the beginning, they were allowed to take my oldest places. It wasn’t very far and they told me where they were going. When he was around 2-3, my husband and I found out that my parents had actually taken him on a shopping trip an hour and half away from us and didn’t say a single word about it. My husband and I were both pissed. I explained to my mom that we can’t drop our child off and they run off with him like that. She was shocked that we were upset and said “she didn’t see a problem with it and she was a good driver so we just just trust her”. I decided to give them a second chance and I ended up finding out that my mom had planned to take him the zoo 2 hours away and not tell me. I didn’t drop him off that day and he stayed home with us. Ever since then, I won’t let my parents or anyone else drive our kids around. My anxiety has gotten bad recently (which makes me think that I’m the asshole, I’m always blaming myself) but I also lost a significant amount of trust in my parents. My mom called me tonight out of the blue because she wanted to know what she did in the past that made us to not want them to drive the kids around. I explained the situation and she started crying. She was making me feel extremely guilty. She kept saying to put myself in her shoes because when I have grandkids, I’ll want to take them places too and that “this is just how it’s suppose to be”. 
Our relationship isn’t the greatest anyways, I grew up being mentally and emotionally abused by my parents.  I’m still dealing with trauma from all of that. SO am I the asshole and just need to suck it up or do I have valid reasons for not letting them take my kids places? I will also add that we visit them once once a week for dinner, plus see them a couple weekends a month and they also come to my husbands softball games and my sons tball games.

254,1c61e4o,AITA if I left a friend without a table for prom,"So prom is coming up and we had to make our tables, minimum 7 people.

I have 2 friends who dated for 11 months, let's call them Tom and Sarah, Tom is my best friend since middle school. I met Sarah a little before they started dating. 

Even after they've broken up I remained extremely close with both of them. However, Tom for some reason can't be in the same place or room as Sarah. No one cheated, they ended in good terms, they broke up in October 2023. He says he has nothing against her yet never wants to go to the same parties or places as her.

 I keep ending up in situations where I have to choose one or the other. I've been able to balance it well but I guess today I broke that streak. 

We had formed a group with 8 people, including Tom, Sarag had no one else to sit with, and was going to be left without a table. I asked Tom if it was okay if I included her, shes friends with everybody on the table, and they weren't going to be together all night, besides the tables are just for eating dinner, we're going to be standing up all prom. I explained to Tom to please be considerate and just let her sit there. He said there was no way and that it was his decision and to please respect it. He threatened to leave the table if I included her and that meant him + 2 other people, leaving us with only 5 persons and them only 3.  

I had no idea what to do and I had to submit the names. I ended up submitting the 8 people table without Sarah who remember is a very close friend of mine too. I understand why she got mad I mean I left her out. But I had to choose to kick one or the other off the table, one meant leaving everybody without a secure table and Tom being mad at me, or Sarah being mad at me. 

I've explained to her that the tables don't really matter and that I was in a moral dilemma, she still got mad for leaving her alone. But what option did I have? Does she not realize I'm trying to balance 2 friendships? I'm not responsible for Tom's emotions or decisions. And one friend left the table to be with Sarah.",Asshole,2024-04-17,1.0,0.11703841,0,0

I (23, f) have an older sister, “Alicia” (27, f), who has been in a relationship with her boyfriend, “Hugo” (34, m), for about 5 years now. They’re pretty serious, and there have been talks about marriage in the near future.

The problem lies within his financial stability. Pre-COVID, Hugo was in sales and was doing pretty well financially, and that was when he and Alicia started dating. During COVID, his workplace went out of business, so he lost his primary source of income. A year ago, he got a job in retail. However, my sister is doing pretty well at her job, and her pay is good too.

My mother and I have been noticing that whenever they go on dates or out with us, Alicia has been the one paying for both of them. Even when Hugo’s over at our house (we still live with our mom) and when we order takeout, Alicia is the one paying. Lately, my mom has been getting upset about this. My mom has even offered to foot the bill some days because she felt bad for my sister, but Hugo never speaks up about getting the bill. We notice that even when they go on dates, they would take her car instead of his.

One day, my mom and I had had enough, and she told me to try to speak with my sister about it. When I did, she got defensive of him. I tried telling her that from my point of view, it doesn’t seem fair at all. She told me they make the same amount of money — and if that were true, how come I never see him offering to pay for anything? It’s not like he has any huge commitments; he still lives with his parents too.

My sister told me that if we keep bringing this up, she would start to doubt her relationship with Hugo. I told her that’s not really our problem; if she’s doubting, then maybe she shouldn’t be with him. Now she’s upset and won’t speak to me.

I (24F) recently started talking to this older woman Lisa,(30F)for about a month. We met on Hinge. She’s very sweet and we have a lot in common despite the age difference. She’s the oldest I’ve ever sought out. As we started talking more and getting to know each other, we eventually started talking about our dating history etc. This is where I got a lil anxious because I essentially don’t have one! I’m 24 and a late bloomer. Life got in the way so dating wasn’t that high on my priority list. I’ve also spent so many years trying to figure out my sexuality without ever physically experiencing it so i have never done anything before, never been in a relationship etc. I did let Lisa know that I don’t really have a dating history and I’ve never been in a serious relationship. She seems fine with that but i never disclosed that I was a virgin either. We haven’t really talked about it, but I am definitely interested in developing a physical relationship with her. I’m just afraid that our age difference will have an impact in that department and based on what she’s told me of her history, she’s obviously more experienced than me. She’s even let me know that I’m probably the youngest she’s ever talked to/persued. I’m not sure how she’ll take being with someone with little to no experience nor if she’d even want to be in a position to “teach” someone. I don’t want to scare her away with that responsibility but I also don’t want to lie to her and i think i WBTA by starting off with a lie. I’m so conflicted.

Context: I 28F and my boyfriend 30M of 3+ years are currently at an impass and are In need of objective advice. We are both African. However I have been raised in the west my whole life while he was raised in Africa. This may be relevant as its possible that it may be due to cultural differences.

My boyfriend called me today telling me that he didn't remember where he parked his car. He was headed to a store and parked his car a little distance away because he couldn't get parking closer. So he parked it and walked about 4 minutes to get to his Destination. When he came out maybe 30 minutes later, he didn't remember where he had parked his car as he's not familiar with the area which is when he called me. We tried looking at Google maps to see if it had tracked his movements but the feature wasn't enabled. We tried googling it but none of the suggestions worked. So I was getting ready to go meet him and help him look for his car. While we were on the phone, my brother was getting ready to leave. In order to stop him I from leaving I told him about the current situation. Also, He has and iphone and I have an android so I thought there may be a feature on iPhone that I wasn't familiar with that could help us find the car.

Long story short: we found the car and all is fine. The issue is that my boyfriend thinks that I shouldn't have said anything because I embarrassed him and made him look bad to my family. He believes that I should've known better than to speak on this to other people because we should always make sure to protect each other's image (I completely agree with that). I told him that the reasons I told my brother are: 1) the issue was time sensitive and I needed to stop him from leaving, 2) we needed a solution which I thought my brother could offer, 3) this isn't something I thought would be embarrassing to him because it's happened to him and myself.

I've told him all of this but we're at a disagreement. He believes that I have completely broken his confidence and is questioning whether or not I can be trusted.

After ruminating on it during the weekend, I realized she probably meant that she knew everyone was having issues with me, and for a while, no one wanted to tell me about it. So, the following Monday I went to Melissa and asked her if there was a problem. She said ""You're not crazy something is going on"", and said that we could speak later that day and not at work. 

We talked on the phone and expressed that she felt uncomfortable that I was expressing my frustration and emotions about my situation with Alexis and Katherine. She felt that I put her in a bad position by doing so and that she felt as if there was distrust now. She also expressed that I made her feel uncomfortable when I mentioned that I was frustrated with the lack of supplies (we work in a field where we are constantly using paper supplies, pens, folders, etc., and the new person in charge of stocking has not kept up to date). 

I apologized to Melissa, saying that I never meant to put her in such a position. I didn't realize I was doing so. But, I also didn't say nasty things about Alexis or Katherine. I never spilled their secrets or talked actual shit about them. I did not know I put Melissa in an uncomfortable position, as she never expressed that to me before she just pulled away. She claimed that she didn't know the three of them were not talking to me, but I told her that Katherine had not talked to me in weeks. 

She is unsure where she wants to go from here. I told her the ball was in her court, as she was the one who had the problem with me.

263,1c6078q,WIBTA for leaving my roommates to fend for themselves after I move out?,"I've lived in the place I'm at now for a few years. It's a more expensive area so there are three of us living here to divide up the rent costs. Roommates come and go and the general practice is that when one person leaves they find someone else to fill the spot on the lease. 

Well, I'm getting married in a few weeks and it just so happens that the yearly lease expires about the same time, so I am leaving. Both the landlord and both my roommates have known this was my plan for at least two months. I didn't actually start the moving process until a few weeks ago, but my fiance and I have already found a new place and I've started to pack my things.

Problem is my roommates are making it very difficult for me to find someone to take over the lease. It started with them wanting to find a friend to take my spot, so I let them ask around for two weeks to no avail. So I said I was going to make a post online to which I was told to hold on because the roommates wanted to change what rooms they are staying in. I've waited another almost two weeks now with no cleaning or progress from either of them.

I'm moving out in just over a week and can't really list or show off a room that is a mess when it may not even be the room they decide will be available for rent. The new lease has been signed and I am not on it. Am I wrong for wanting to just move on and let them figure it all out after I'm gone?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-17,0.0,0.9880149,1,0
