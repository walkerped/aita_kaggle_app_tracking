0,1c8hmx1,AITA for miscommunicating with my mother?,"I (17F) had a rehearsal dance because I’m performing at my friends birthday party. As she also had other performers, the rehearsal time was long. My mom insisted on picking me up at 6:30PM even though the main rehearsal was going to likely end at 9:00PM. 

For this reason, I asked my sister to take my dads car to an event so my other sister could use hers to pick me up. I assumed this was the plan as my other sister would have no other reason to use my dads car. I told my mom my sister would pick me up. However my sister who was supposed to pick me up wasn’t able to look at her phone so she never saw. 

Suddenly I get a call from my mom angrily telling me to come outside because “I lied” to her. She called me crooked even though I apologized for not getting my information right. I got upset because she accused me of lying but she still called me things. She said it was like getting stabbed with a knife because I didn’t tell her.

AITA for causing a miscommunication between my mom and I?

1,1c8h9lt,AITA for going to me and my bestie's favorite restaurant?,"So me (29F) and my best friend (M29) have this favorite restaurant that we love. We've only ever been there together once almost a year ago now. It was the first and last time. We've tried to get together there a couple times but he's religious and can't make it there after dark because of Shabbat (I believe that's what he calls it. I'm not familiar with the rules for his religion). Thing is I love the place and I feel safe being there. I have gone on dates by myself there a couple times and made a couple friends within the staff. I have a 1st date tomorrow and when I told him I was going there for the date he flipped out on me. Saying it's our spot and I shouldn't be going with out him. I told him its not like never invited him to go with and that I've asked him to come with before I went myself. Then he wanted to say it's like him going to Metallica without me. I told him it's not the same because he didn't even like Metallica. He hung up on me right after that. I feel bad about everything and even tried to call him back which rang to voicemail. Then I sent him a text after I confirmed the new place, date and time with my date. Still no response. So now I'm wondering if I'm the asshole here for going to a restaurant I love and feel comfortable at because it pisses off my bestie?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,0.014402551,0,1
2,1c8h8l5,AITA for not donating to a  children’s charity ,"I had an interaction the other day with three fraternity brothers who were tabling while walking to a test. I was running late to my test and one of the guys started asking me if I would be interested in donating to a charity benefitting starving children in the local community. I cut him off right as he said the word charity and just said “ ah no fuck the children sorry”. I then hurried past their table while avoiding eye contact.
 Am I the asshole for how I handled the interaction? I feel bad in hindsight for not taking the time to at least hear them out and consider donating.

3,1c8h8kj,AITA for photoshopping my female friend’s body when she asked me to make her look prettier?,"I’m a straight male by the way, to clear up any confusion before it starts. I post a lot on Instagram and I’ve been known to make myself look a lot better in the pictures than in real life. I use this Chinese app to make my subtle beautifying adjustments. I don’t hate how I look by the way. I’m pretty fit and am pretty handsome, but I like to make myself as close to perfect as possible in the pictures. 

The app is really great. I can do things like narrowing the nose, enlarging the eyes, slimming the face, lowering the hairline, widening the chest, narrowing the waist, lengthening the legs, concealing acne, etc. You can’t even tell I have made adjustments to the picture unless I show you the original. 

My female friend asked me if I could make adjustments to her photos to make her look prettier. I told her about the app. She looked at it and said it was too complicated for her. I asked her what she wanted to be beautified and she said to use my best judgment to make her look more beautiful. She’s already pretty gorgeous by the way, but hey even pretty people want to be prettier. 

She sent me 5 photos and off I went. Pro bono work. It’s really quick to beautify these pictures by the way, only about 5 minutes per picture. I did the basic beautifications with her face like I mentioned above. With her body, I made her waist a tiny bit narrower and her hips a tad bit wider. But in the 2 pictures where her boobs are visible and can easily be manipulated with, I made them look about a cup size bigger each. 

When I sent the beautified pictures back to her, before saying thanks, she questioned me why I messed with her boobs. I told her that’s what she wanted me to do, to use my best judgment to make her look as perfect as possible while still looking like herself. She told me that was unnecessary and I’m body and booby shaming her for my own enjoyment. I told her it was a misunderstanding then and if she only wanted her face beautified, she should have clarified. She sent me the emoji with the dash line eyes and the underscore mouth and that was that.

4,1c8gvya,AITA FOR USING THE WOMENS BATHROOM AT WORK?,"I (20m) work at Carl's Jr. Today, my manager Cristina told me to go clean both bathrooms. That's normal. Every employee can clean any bathroom regardless of gender. I first started cleaning the men's one. After cleaning it, I went into the women's one to clean. However, I felt like I had to go to the bathroom so I sat down on the toilet and started going to the bathroom. My manager said thru the miicrophone headset ""Donovan are you cleaning the bathrooms?"". I said yes and 10 seconds later I heard the door being unlocked. She has the keys to both bathrooms, and I said ""don't come in here!"" right when I heard the door being unlocked but it happened so fast she already opened it and saw me on the toilet. Then she yelled at me, saying ""why were you using the bathroom?? I told you to claan, not go to the bathroom!!"".  I said I was cleaning as well and that I just had to go, not expecting her to come help me clean. She said ""why were you using the women's bathroom? That's not for you!! Use the mens!!"" And she ran over to my co workers and started telling them I was using the women's bathroom. I personally am not convinced that she didnt do it on purpose to check if i was cleaning or if I was being lazy by using it as an excuse to sit down and not work. Every time I go to the bathroom she complains about it taking too long (maybe I do take too long sometimes, but I try my best. I'm never more then 10 minutes, I'm usually 4 or 5 minutes). She's knocked on the door before when I clean the men's bathroom or even go to the men's bathroom to do my business and asks ""are you on your phone or are you cleaning??"" It's weirded me out that she acts obnoxious like this every damn time I go into the bathroom because she thinks I'm playing on my phone to escape work. I do think I could have done better by telling her thru the headset that I was going to be using the bathroom as well, and I could have used the men's bathroom but I didn't feel like I had to go until I was in the other one. Never in a million years did I think she would use the keys to open the door without knocking. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,0.055136245,0,1
5,1c8gq97,AITA? I was awarded a position that didn’t know a co worker was going for. Now they’re upset because I got it. ,"I had applied for a position at a facility a town over because the hours were what I was looking for. The commute is longer, but the trade off is more days off so I can do an online course and still have time with my family. I found out today that I was awarded the position and was excited because a co worker (I’ll call them Brie)  I got on with at my other facility was going there too and already had a permanent position there. 

The feeling wasn’t mutual. Brie accused me of stealing jobs from people who live in that town never mind that they don’t live there either. Then started claiming that I knew they were going for that position and stole it from them. Except I didn’t know they were going for it. Then Brie started going on about how I’ll probably leave anyway because of my poor work ethic. 

Now admittedly I feel bad, but positions are awarded based on seniority so even if I hadn’t applied for this position there’s no guarantee that Brie would’ve been awarded the position instead. Besides she’d never said she was going for a different line after having a new permanent line. 

T/L D/R : co worker is mad that I was awarded a position they’d wanted because I have more seniority and didn’t know they were going for this line. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,-0.0063897166,0,1
6,1c8ghm0,"AITA, think living together ruined my (18f) and my bff's (19f) friendship","Due to her (Hannah) circumstances we lived together in the same room. (She did college online hated it, so she moved in with me to go in person)

I told her before we moved in together that I am someone who requires lots of communication. However over the course of our time living together she simply, didn't communicate. And now it feels like she has resentment towards me. 

Recently she got into like a car crash and I was in the passenger seat with her. During that time she wound up living with her boyfriend and I think she likes it better. 

However she left like a fish tank in my room and after the accident, the fish died. (They been dying)

In the morning I have set times I have to get up due to autism. I have my schedule and she was for the most part car pooling in my vehicle. So I paid for gas, I also never asked her to pay for gas etc. There were times she didn't have any money so if i happened to buy myself breakfast I also purchased her breakfast. There was also a point where I paid for her car note. She did pay me back like 20$ but then I lightly tapped her car with my car (not a great driver) and so I told her just keep the portion I paid for the car's note to that. And we can call it even. (Only scratched the paint) 

I'm also not like rich or anything and we were staying in my parents home. Well the accident where she was driving happened, and her car got totaled. So she went to stay with her boyfriend. 

Well she's dropping out of college now. Which is her decision. And she came back to finally do this fish tank that I've been constantly struggling with since she got. Since it stunk since fish had died etc. I feel really good that the tank is gone and I no longer have that responsibility. 

However, she started bringing up complaints. About me while she was here. That I had hurt her feelings making her come do this tank while she was going through everything. However mind you this was week 3 of me dealing with the tank. She also has been super unresponsive. 

No texts back, no reels sent. And she also lowkey blamed me for her computer being broke in the accident when it happened. And when I mentioned that I had bruises, that I didn't. Which I brushed off, I told insurance to drop any files on that since while I reported my injuries I'm not trying to make her insurance pay for it. 

Everytime we are on call she makes me feel like I'm a burden. (Doesn't answer texts, or call me) All of this is deeply hurting my feelings. I've never asked for anything from her. I woke up her up every morning even though she treated me like crap every morning but i understood that bc im not a ray of sunshine in the morning either and, I took care of her fish, but now I'm just a bother. 

My room is cluttered because it's all of her and my stuff and I just am overwhelmed. I've been overwhelmed. But I thought at least we were friends. But now I think she's pretending until she fully moves in with her boyfriend. Have I done something wrong somewhere?

7,1c8gcjl,AITA for telling my neighbors that we will take action if their nephew with down syndrome continues to trespass.,"Backstory: there is a tree canopy on our street starting at our house. It is allowed so long as the trees are maintained. My neighbor has no trees but parks in front of our house under the trees. This doesn't bother me.

We had a storm and a branch from our tree fell on their car. They asked for our car insurance, I tried to explain it was covered under the house insurance and gave them that info. I also called my insurance and sent them pictures to start the process.

Next day, they came over asked if I had heard anything from my insurance and asked again about car insurance. I asked for their phone and email to give to the insurance agent, gave that info to the agent. He called and left messages but he called me to verify the info because they never returned the calls. 

The neighbors asked a couple more times about my insurance over the week. I just told them they have to call them. They seemed to be getting angrier but they never talked to the insurance agent and I don't know what they wanted from me.

We scheduled tree removal and asked that they remove their car beforehand. During that conversation, the man with down syndrome, Alec, yelled from behind the door that it was his car. It was explained that Alec inherited it and he liked to take specific rides in it and that he is very upset it is damaged. I said I hope that it is sorted soon for him and got glares.

After the car was moved, Alec started staring in our windows and throwing items in our yard. Initially, I took the items to their porch but he threw the things right back over. Shoes, garden tools, etc.

I put curtains in the front so my dog would stop going crazy and kept the items in a tote until they came to get the items. He started throwing things at the house and tried to break the gate and climb the fence. Most of this is on camera.

When they picked up the items, they asked that we just unlock the gate for Alec and then he can get the things himself and will eventually lose interest in throwing things. ""It is good for him to pick up after himself"".

I refused, I have a dog with a dog door, I don't want Alec to try and crawl through,  I don't want my dog to get out and I don't want her to possibly injure someone who comes on our property. I have been hospitalized a lot this year and she is being weird and protective. 

I also sent an email and text that Alec is not allowed on our property and I will take action if he damages anything. They didn't respond by email but have knocked and yelled and said we owe them.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,0.013907981,0,1

There’s is this friend group of girls in my school and one of the people in the friend group has a crush on me.

9,1c8fjhl,AITAH for not giving my coworkers cat back ,"Let me start by saying that I feel really bad about this situation and my heart is completely torn. So two years ago, a coworker of mine (we’ll call her O) asked me if I could watch her cat (B) while she moved in with her parents until she could she was in a better spot to move back into an apartment. she couldn’t take B with her because her parents said no and they had a German shepherd that would “eat the cat.”  I said yes, figuring I would watch him for a month or two and she would find an apartment and take him back. two years go by and she’s probably given me $40 total for cat food and litter and came over to clean the litter box probably less than 5 times. O also had another coworker (M) watching a different cat of hers at the same time. she told M pretty much off the bat that she could start calling the cat whatever name she wanted. in M’s eyes, O was pretty much saying “this is your cat now.” After that, M immediately took the cat to the shelter because she did not want her own cat and did not tell O.  

B adjusted well living with me and bonded very closely with my other two cats. they snuggle together, groom each other, and all have different special relationships. i tried for a long time to fight the fact that he was in fact becoming a member of the family, saying i had 2.5 cats. but eventually, with more time spent, he was just as much as a member of the family as the cats i adopted myself are. we all adore him so much. when my oldest cat passed away, he really took on the role of the alpha of the household and his personality changed a lot. he started actively taking care of the younger cats (we rescued a kitten at the time too and ended up keeping her), so he instantly assumed the role of their papa. it was amazing to watch how he stepped up knowing the other cats needed a leader. that’s what this is really all about. how bonded the cats are. 

Well… O texted me saying that her parents German Shepherd passed and she’s ready to take him to their place because there isn’t much of a threat anymore. this was a GIANT shock to say the least because in my eyes it seemed like she really lost interest in finding a better place for her and B to live and that he was here to stay with us. I feel in pieces thinking about separating the cats and also about him being in yet another new environment once he’s finally made an amazing home here with kitty brothers and sisters and people that love him, that aren’t gonna change up on him and someone who has a safe place for him stay no matter what happens. IMO, she should feel good knowing B is so loved and well taken care of. I haven’t really known what to say to O because I don’t know how to tell her I don’t feel right separating them at this point after two years. This july will be 3 years. I don’t know if I might be in the wrong or if it’s selfish of her to even consider taking him back, so am I the asshole for wanting to keep the cats together and telling her no she can’t have her cat back?

10,1c8fjbl,AITA: For not wanting my brother in law living with my wife and I?,"So my Wife (30F) has an apartment where her mother stays with her, her mom (54F) can’t work more than part time because of health issues (spinostenosis?) ever since we started dating… she recently also brought in her brother (25M), after he graduated from UC Berkeley. 

He got a job as a school site monitor part time, minimum wage from his mom referring him for the job she also does. Currently there are no plans for him to move out, find a diff ok on or anything else. 


My wife pays the rent, utilities and some other bills. 


Mother in law pays : insurance for her car and my wife’s car. Some groceries every other few months here and there. 


Brother in law: pays for his cellphone (financed IPhone 15 pro) my wife’s phone plan, and my mother in laws phone plan. 


So lately, I have been looking at places where my wife and I could reside together, I miss her and seeing her once or twice a month is really difficult. This would displace her mother (55F) and her (25M) brother, they cannot afford to rent a place on their own from what I am told. And they work in the city in which they reside with my wife (30F). 


Lately, it has been causing fights whenever I visit my wife (I sleep on the couch when visiting her and clean up the apartment a little because her mom and her brother leave it messy with trash around and don’t clean) 


I have brought up the idea of him moving out, me moving in with my wife and her mother to care for her.  I currently live about 70 miles away with my parents, so I can commute to work to a job that is 100 miles away from my wife’s apartment. 


However it leads to huge arguments with my mother in law screaming at me, my wife screaming at me, and her brother also raising his voice. 


Lately I have felt everything I do is wrong, at work, my home life… it feels like life hasn’t been great.

11,1c8fgn7,WIBTA for not letting my mom use my credit to get a loan to buy a house?,"For background info, my mom married a horrible abusive narcissist that is going through a mental health crisis. I've told her for years that she should get herself together because his behavior is only getting worse and all she's done is blown me off. It's gotten to the point now that I feel as though she's trying to manipulate me down a life path I do not want, putting the entire responsibility of getting her away from her husband onto me.

Years ago, prior to my autism diagnoses, she sent me to job corps where I had the worse time being taken advantage of by staff and students. I had to lie about my mental health to escape to which she blamed me for not seeing it through. Now she wants to force me into a program similar to job corps, where I'd be learning a trade and being paid for it. She says if my credit stays above 620 and I have some form of income we can get a loan and she'll be able to leave her husband.

My thing is, I don't trust her. The last time she used my credit, she put me in debt of $1k. I don't want to be forced to learn a trade, forced into a career for the rest of my life that I hate just to save her and make her happy and keep myself protected from possible debt. I want to live my life for me and start a career that I enjoy. Yes I do want to get away from her husband too, but I don't want to be used. She has never truly been a mother to me anyways and I fail to see how it's my job to be her savior for something she chose to do even after numerous people- even her own parents warned her about him.

Not to mention I spent at least 6 months researching different types of loans and housing options, even making a 15 page powerpoint begging her to listen to me and choose one of the other options that doesn't leave me being her slave.

My (f17) half sister (f16), Ella, is a menace. She constantly steals from me and treats me horribly. This has gone on for our entire childhood and I’ve always had to be the bigger person. 
A few months back I was diagnosed with a skin condition that’s pretty harmless but I have to apply a steroid treatment every night before bed. Also a few months ago, Ella moved into my bathroom since her shower pipe burst and our parents haven’t the money to fix it right now. Ever since she’s moved in, the bathroom has been dirty, my shampoo is now OUR shampoo, and she even took my flatiron and claims to have “lost it”. I’m not salty. 
Anyway.
I walk into our bathroom one night realizing I forgot to apply my skin treatment to Ella squeezing abysmal amounts of it into her hands. I immediately freak out cause hello??? And I get this sick idea in my head to scare her into not touching my MEDICATED skin treatment and said, “Oh my God, Ella, you can die if you use that.” Her face literally fell and she asked me to elaborate and I said, “There’s a chemical in it that starts attacking your immune system if you don’t have the illness.”
Ella starts freaking out and wipes it off and she’s crying hysterically and honestly it was pretty funny. That is until our dad walks in and sees Ella crying. He immediately asks what’s wrong and she tells him what happened and he reassures her that she’s not going to die. Ella goes to her room and then our dad turns to me and starts lecturing me about being nicer to Ella and that I need to start acting my age. The next morning he made me apologize to Ella and I had to miss my after school club as punishment. 
My friends all think that I’m right and that she deserved it but Ella and our mom are both ignoring me.

13,1c8eiko,AITA for disagreeing with my bf and providing feedback?,"I \[34M\], had a small disagreement with my bf of 7 years \[33m\]. I was explaining a new business idea to him and he asked me a lot of good questions and offered some critiques. After answering his question, he started telling me about how he once asked his aunt for advice on starting a business. He explained how she told him he needed to come up with a business idea before she could help him figure out how to start it. I said ""I don't want you to take this personally, but she was right. You have to have an idea about what business you want to start before she could help you learn how to start it"". This made him upset and he said he ""wasn't finished"" and that he was just ""venting"". I apologized and told him, it wasn't my intent to make him feel bad or to feel like he couldn't vent, but now we aren't speaking.

I think I may be the AH because I don't know what else he was going to say, but he stopped speaking before I gave my opinion. I also thought it was okay to give that feedback because he had just got done giving me feedback on my business idea.

The thing that makes me think he may be the AH is that, this seems to be a pattern where he gets feedback he doesn't agree with and does one or both of the following: 

* Gets defensive
* Says he was just venting; implying he doesn't want feedback.

I can definitely understand just wanting to vent, but it's not always obvious that he's venting as this usually happens when we are conversing about a topic and then I offer a dissenting opinion. An example of this happening was a few weeks ago. He was telling me how a friend of his was having doubts about her relationship and whether she wanted kids with the guy she's dating. He went on to explain that her boyfriend already has custody of his two children and he always wants to include them in their plans. She's fine with having the kids around but worries that if she has a child with the guy, their child together will never get to spend time alone with the father, without his other siblings. She essentially wanted to have a family that did not include all of his children, just the one that they shared. I thought this was ludicrous to expect that someone you met with children to not have them around if you decide to make another child with him and told him that. He did NOT agree! He understood how she felt and thought it was fair to expect that the new child have quality alone time with their father, absent their siblings. I pointed out how selfish that seems of her and he accused me of blowing it out of proportion and that he was ""just trying to vent"". We ended up having a calmer conversation about it the next day and it went well.

We have both been trying to improve our communication. He is in therapy and I am seeking a therapist currently since switching insurance providers. This most recent fight feels silly, but I don't want to dismiss his feelings. I also want to be able to be honest with my boyfriend. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,0.9805252,1,0
14,1c8e9iv,AITA for wanting to go workout at the gym? ,"I a 23f am a stay at home mom of two (1yr/3yr) whose husband works full time. This means I do not get a lot of time for myself in general., but especially not a lot of time to go out of the house child free. The gym I go to has a parent/child room but I enjoy going by myself and just getting it done without having to stress about my kids.
 I haven’t been able to go in a while and was feeling gross so I told my husband while we were hanging out on Saturday that I wanted to go sometime during the day. He got upset and said “we’ll see”, for context he plans to be gone 8plus hours to go golfing Sunday/ had already been golfing after work Thursday and had friends over Wednesday. All of these things require me to watch our kids alone. 

He told me he had plans to go buy balls Saturday with or 3yr old but that was it, so I thought I’d have enough time to go workout. I got upset at his response to my question about working out and he said it’s because I “Threw a monkey wrench in the days plans, and that I can’t just throw stuff at him last minute” I was confused how because the only thing we planned in advance was him going to the store. Apparently I was wrong. 

He said he told me about needing to practice golf again on Saturday after he didn’t do well on his Thursday practice. I told him I don’t remember him saying anything about that and it’s ridiculous that he gets to have all the time to do what he wants but I can’t go to the gym for an hour or two since I didn’t “tell him in advance” 

I am upset but can see where he is coming from if he told me about wanting to practice more on Saturday and I just forgot. However I think it’s dumb that he says he wants to make my Saturday easier before he’s gone all day Sunday but says no to me working out during his “supposed”(I still don’t remember him saying anything about it) predetermined golf time.

I(21m) was going out to dinner (pizza place) with my parents (F/M 50's) and they were arguing over a house contract while we were waiting for our food (we're in the process of closing on a new place) and my dad asked the waitress who looked barely 18 if he could change his order, and she came back with ""no, it's pretty much already done so you can't"" and my dad replied with ""you're not the only woman to disappoint me today"" trying to be funny but right after she walked off, I could see her talking shit with the other servers and told my folks as much. When she came back, he tried to explain it was a joke but you could tell she wasn't buying it and pretty much ghosted us the rest of the night and seemed all too eager to give us the check.

When we were driving back from the place, I brought it up to my dad that what he said was more offensive than funny and I was told to ""stop trying to judge him, I wasn't his conscious. It was a joke and I should shut the hell up""

I know I probably shouldn't have said anything, because it just ended up pissing everyone off, but it's getting to a point where I don't really want to go out in public anymore because he always has something to say about the staff of a restaurant.

Reddit, am I the asshole here? I'm not trying to sound like an entitled little shit here, so please tell me if I'm just acting entitled, but I feel like there's a point where it becomes a problem.

16,1c8dqqs,AITA for asking my mom to turn on the AC?,"I (23F) live with my mother (48F) and sister (19F, Sam). Our AC unit has not worked properly in nearing 10 years (My dad's ""buddy"" installed the unit improperly and screwed us over. Would cost several grand that we don't have to fix. Could've had it fixed by now but a string of financial factors prevented repair), but it functions enough that we can run it for several hours & keep the house decently cool in the summer.

This week, temperatures peaked at 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celcius) and that peak day it got up to 84 degrees Fahrenheit (28C) in the house. Into the evening it cooled off outside, and in my bedroom alone I had a ceiling fan, a tall floor fan by the open window (it was now cooler outside than inside), and a small fan attached to my bedframe, all on high speed. It was still 83 in the house.

Sam and I had been delaying to ask if we could turn the AC unit on since we know it racks up the power bill, but the temperature was becoming unbearable. I bit the bullet and asked. She asked if my window was open? Yes. Fans on? Yes. Blinds open to let in more air? Without the whole neighborhood seeing into my room? Yes. Hmmm, no, it's not hot enough.

I slept with only a sheet covering me (since I can't sleep with zero coverage) and still stuck my legs out I was so hot. It took significantly longer for me to fall asleep, and to make matters worse it was the night before starting a new job, which I desperately needed good sleep for. My mom claimed that she slept fine. Sam noted to me that she probably slept better because her room is surrounded by interior walls, while ours are both exterior.

Here's where I worry that I may be the asshole. 

I graduated from college last year. Since then I've been working food service while looking for full time work in my field of study, and just picked up a part time job in said field to get my foot in the door. (Long story to why I didn't have work straight out of college). When I graduated, she told me she would not charge me rent while I get on my feet, that way I could start paying off student loans with fervor. I help out with groceries, drive Sam places since she cannot drive yet, etc.

Recently, my mom has started using rent and finances as a reason to deny both Sam & I various things, such as teaching Sam to drive or turning on the AC. As soon as that started, both of us immediately offered to pitch in with monthly expenses, we just needed to know how much she needed, how we could help lower expenses. Despite the many times both of us have asked, she never gave us information to what the bills look like every month. Sam says our mom withdrew funds from her bank account, but I've never observed this from mine, and yet my mom still holds it against both of us for not helping more. 

Am I asking for too much in asking for the AC to be turned on? 2/3 of the house are miserable. I asked again today (high 80s), she denied again, citing that it'll get into the 50s tonight & to just leave our windows open.

17,1c8do87,WIBTA if I sent a colleague dog training pamphlets and flyers,"So, I have a colleague who is an artist, “Bob”. He has the art studio across the hall from mine and we have become somewhat friends. I have become acquainted with his four Jack Russell terriers, which I call “The 4 Terrors” because they can be rather wild.

To people, those pups are lovable and sweet, though, again, a little wild- jumping up and giving love bites. To other animals- they are like wild dogs. I personally have only ever seen them bark incessantly at the other dog and chase them down the hall, but never be aggressive or dangerous. It seems their bark is worse than their bite.

The Terrors are constantly barking in his studio and many people in our building are not happy with Bob or them. I have taken them walking and tried to do some training, but my limited time with them hasn’t really made a difference. I feel like they haven’t really had any training. They seem to react to some simple commands, but not too many.

Well, I like to dog sit and so I have a revolving set of dogs in my studio. Bob is conscientious enough and won’t let The Terrors into my studio with any other dogs there, but his solution to it all is to just avoid socialization  except between them. 

Now, I’m up at his place with The Terrors and I’ve met some of his neighbors and although they have been generally nice to me (a little brunt at times, but informative and not accusatory) and it seems like he’s not on great terms with any of them… because of the dogs! The dogs came with me to the mailbox today, which is down the street. The dogs were interested in a boy playing with a baseball in his front yard. The dogs were delightful with the kid, but the dad came out and told me the dogs are not welcome on his property because they have attacked the cat and when his sister brought her dog they attacked it too. I said I understood and got them home and will not bring them to the mailbox again.

It’s no big deal and I didn’t get yelled at, but it really instilled that same feeling I have had before. They don’t have enough training and they NEED training. I can only do so much in my short time, but I’m afraid that if I broach the subject or leave pamphlets that I would come off as rude or offensive. I love these pups and I just want everyone to see their good side and for them to not get into trouble.

Eventually she ended up cheating on me with one of her employees and we ended up getting divorced. When we met she had a teenage daughter. I was never a father to her daughter but we got along pretty well. During our marriage I bought myself a new car on a 3 year lease, I'm not sure how it works in other regions but in my country at the end of the lease you can either return the car or pay the 40-50% value and keep it. And that was the plan, to pay off the car and give it to my ex wife and then get another one. 

But because we ended up divorcing, after my lease ended last month I ended up giving the car to my ex's daughter. She had just passed her driving test, I knew she was looking to buy her first car and I wanted to give her my car. She may not be my daughter but she was there for me when her mother cheated, she was the reason I didn't fall back into old addictions and  love her like she was my own daughter. 

After my ex found out about this she accused me of sleeping with her daughter, which isn't true.

So I live with my dad and step-brother, and a week or so ago they decided to get a puppy. Didn't even ask, my dad just popped his head into my room and said ""hey we're gonna have a dog""

The thing is that I'm not really a fan of dogs, I don't hate them but they're just really not my kind of animal. On top of that I got attacked by one when I was a kid so they make me a little nervous. My biggest issue was that we have two cats and one got attacked by a dog just months ago and just hearing one outside freaks her out

Even though I wasn't at all happy, I figured since I'm not exactly paying to live here that I would just have to deal with it. I made it clear that i wasn't going to be the one taking care of it unless I really had to and luckily my dad agreed

This morning I was doing chores around the house before work and the dog had to go outside, my dad told me to take him out and didn't say anything back when I told him I was busy so I just opened the back door for him and let him out into the yard while I went back to work

My dad came downstairs maybe 5 minutes later and asked me why the door was open, I told him the dog was out there and he started getting on my ass about leaving him outside alone. I figured he would be fine since we have a pretty good fence and we made sure that nothing dangerous or toxic was out there. The dog was fine but my dad told me I needed to grow up and stop acting like I'm the only person who matters

But I'm so bothered that his friend called him and after my partner says he's going out with some guys next weekend.

And truly, seeing them isn't the issue, that's great. But I'm mad and hurt because how many times have I asked, begged, you know? When I have, it's all 'I don't like bars' and yet he's going to one now. He won't go to shows with me,  no live music, or a comedy club. Getting a lil dressed up and going to a late dinner doesn't even happen. I get lunch or casual, early dinner once in a blue moon and it feels like he only does it because he's hungry or obligated. We go to a shop once a month or two, and we grocery shop. We do spend time together at home, play games sometimes, watch movies. But even then it's almost exclusively the activity/movie he wants. 

I miss being wanted, I miss being fucking desired. I wish I were a priority. And I know he loves me, know he's been trying so much more lately. I appreciate it so much, I do! But I worry it's not enough.
I don't want to leave, I want to be with HIM. I want the good things with HIM. But I'm feeling more and more like he holds so much more of me than I do of him.

Maybe I shouldn't have but I said something. I told him I thought it was great he was going out with his friends, but that I really wish he'd go out with me too. Hell, even invite his friends and their partners over sometime, anything! He got pissy and made joking comments to his son about how women don't like men having friends and how we can be so controlling. I just sat there fuming inside. I started to defend myself on how of course I would never be that way, but the way they were laughing like it was the funniest joke in the world just had me shutting down. 
He finally said, irritatedly ""I don't even know if it's gonna work for everyone, it's a maybe"". I replied ""Maybe is more than I ever get"". Then he shut down. I feel bad, it was a hurtful thing to say to him. But it's also true. He's also not really talking to me now. 

I keep telling myself he was just teasing me, that's how he is sometimes, but it's difficult for me to read these situations. I'm neurodivergent af and tbh I just really struggle with reading people, their intentions etc.

I know he loves me, he does show it, but I don't understand. I can't tell if I really do have a right to be angry or not. I would never say he can't go, we're supposed to have our own lives and friends, but I wish he would do things with me, or include me, more. But maybe that's not even the right thing to ask for as I wouldn't want to intrude on his rare night out with friends.

27,1c8ca56,AITA for not paying my Student Loans?,"I (26F) left for college abroad at 17.  My parents always said that college would be taken care of. It was not my goal to go to college, I wanted to take cooking classes and build my own business. However this request was dismissed. If i knew what I know now i would have FOUGHT more to achieve this.  
  
When signing up I remembered the degree I chose was not government-assisted (I was born in the country I moved to study, my parents planned all of this out) but I didn't worry as I knew my parents were paying for my school fees. 3 years into said degree, we had a family meeting and my dad told us (my sister and i)  that we were responsible for paying back our loans.  I was confused as I thought they had saved up for college tuition and were paying comfortably. It all started to make sense why I had to sign bank papers every semester,I feel silly now but I was young then and didn’t fully understand the scope of things. I continued college and in the final year started asking more questions about my loan, the amount, how I was to pay.   
  
They told me the amount and I was flabbergasted. I couldn’t believe my parents would take out so much money as we were not well off. The loan is 150,00.00 and would take me 8-10 years to pay off.   
  
Fast Forward to now, I have been paying on time for a year and it takes out a big chunk of my salary. I work (3 jobs, didn’t get a job in the field i studied for) and bring home 7,700 and have to pay 3k (loan fee) minimum per month.  
  
Recently, I moved out of my family home because of safety issues, and a crime neighborhood, I was S.A once coming home and often harassed.   
  
I feel more secure and comfortable but with rent and my school loan it’s impossible to make ends meet. I’ve told my parents I would like to request a deferral (as I am building my catering business, it has definitely helped financially but lack of money is slowing things down) and ultimately to survive. Also, I have to communicate bank queries with them as my dad is joint person on the account.   
  
They then let me know that my cousin's land was used as collateral and contacting him to sign the deferral is not a good idea as his wife wants to take back the land paper to start their life because they need it for collateral. (which i was not aware of)  
  
So I can't get the deferral. They suggest I move back home (my home country: my dad isverbally abusive) or back at the family home where I used to live to alleviate the financial strain. Both are not options for me.   
  
I feel very frustrated and let them know that I can only pay half of the amount. My mom told me to only send what I can. Am i the asshole for doing this? I feel terrible because they are also struggling financially, as my dad lost his job 2 years ago (his fault) and most of the financial burden is on my mom.   
  
I also feel very angry and resent my parents for putting me in this financial set back when it could have been avoided. I feel bratty saying “I didn’t ask for this”.

28,1c8c1xk,"AITA for refusing to carry stuff with me to pass to my sister at the end of a 3-week, 2600 km (1600 mi) road trip and not wanting to commit to spending more time with her during it? ","My sister (41, F) moved from Singapore to Seattle about 1.5 years ago with her husband and son. In that time, my retired parents (68, F and 73, M) have visited her once in Seattle and she's come back to Singapore twice. 

She has always been good at getting her way, and she's gotten multiple friends travelling to and from the US to ferry things back and forth for her. She's also involved my elderly parents in this, making them travel for these exchanges - which I am very unhappy about because she assumes they have nothing better to do than to run errands for her since they're retired. 

I'll (37, F) be going to visit her in May - June 2024 with my husband. We're not willing to fly 16 hours each way to spend a month in just Seattle/nearby, so we'll be landing in San Francisco and driving up the coast over 3 weeks, ending with about 9 days in Seattle.

For context: The country of Singapore is a 49 x 28 km (30 x 17 mi) island. Driving 2800 km is making me quite nervous in itself, even before accounting for the opposite hand drive and different driving rules. We're going to be changing accommodation every 2 or so days, sometimes daily. 

My sister asked me to carry some books and supplements in my luggage to pass to her and I said no because I didn't want to have one more thing to worry about during the trip. A couple days later, her friend texted me wanting to pass some food to my sister on her behalf - meaning that my sister had gone ahead and arranged for me to carry stuff for her even though I'd already said no. 

I asked her about it and she got really angry, saying I could just leave her stuff in the car and forget about it, and how many luggage-loads of things people would bring for their families. I pointed out that this was because the families were meeting them directly, not at the end of a 3-week road trip. 

It's true that I could leave it in the boot... But I guess now I'm just more annoyed at how she once again assumed that I'd eventually be OK to run her errands. 

She's also complained that I haven't carved out enough time for her during my trip, and it seems like more of a holiday for myself than going to see her. I've already adjusted the itinerary to allocate 2 more days in Seattle (9 instead of 7), and now we'll be meeting for 3 days in San Fran as well. (Apparently I can't pass her stuff in SF because she didn't buy luggage space). 

She keeps saying I see my husband every day, I don't need to spend any more time with him. But to me, living with someone day to day is completely different than travelling and having new experiences with them.

29,1c8c1om,AITA for buying a car brand that my girlfriend wanted?,"A bit of context. Two months ago my car's engine broke down and I (23M) was forced to buy a new car to commute back and forth to work. My girlfriend (24) also did not have a car at the time, for close to 8 months, and started to test drive and shop for cars around the same time that I did. Because I didn't have a spare car and I'm under 25 (no rental car), I had no way to get back and forth to work without spending hundreds on Ubers weekly. 

We went to look at cars a few days after my car broke down, at the time I wanted to buy a Toyota Tacoma and my girlfriend wanted to buy a Honda CRV or a Toyota Rav4. The biggest feature I was looking for in a car was a car that would be good for offroading. We checked out both trucks and SUVs and came away happy. One of the ones my girlfriend decided to consider after the visit was a base-trim Subaru Outback.

A week later I had test driven a few more trucks, and decided that a truck wasn't for me. I started to look at other options and found that there are quite a few Mid-Size SUVs that came in an offroading trim, and were within my price range. I found out that Subaru outbacks, foresters, and crosstreks came in a offroading trim, and one of my best friends that's very knowledgeable about cars spoke very highly of the brand, so I decided to buy a Subaru Forester Wilderness. 

My girlfriend has been upset about it ever since, because she said she wanted to buy a Subaru. From my perspective, I was very nervous and stressed out to buy a new car, and I was trying to make a smart decision in a short amount of time, so I went with a Subaru based upon the information I had at the time.

I probably copied her idea subconsciously on buying a midsize SUV without even realizing it because I respect her intelligence and rationality. But, I also feel very awkward, because she was also considering 3-4 other brands of Mid-Size SUVs at the time, so I don't feel that any decision I made would have been the correct one. I didn't want to buy a sedan or a coupe because they're too low to the ground and not good for offroading. A full size SUV as well as a truck would have been too big to take on trails.

30,1c8byrb,AITA for giving the password to my laptop to everyone but my mother? ,"Some bg - I never had a password bc the entire family uses my laptop. Banking, emails, shopping etc. Never had any bigger issues. I am an adult and I bought the laptop in hs with my own money. So no ground for anybody to dictate what i do with it. However my mom does not believe in privacy. It always bothered me a bit and i was always careful incase she went snooping. She has days where she will look for a thing to be mad about - she'll try to read texts, open your mail before you get to it, doesn't matter what was in there if she wants to start a fight she will. 

The thing is I was stupid enough to leave my laptop with messenger logged in. Something came up and i just left it like that. She went through everything there. Claims she only read what was onscreen but references messages that you'd have to scroll far up for. She read mostly the messages between my sister and me, where i was quoting some messed up thing she said, claimed she never said any of that and that i am 'smear campaigning her to strangers on the internet' (for some reason she didn't clock it was my sister). A huge fight broke out about that, which ended in her pretending i don't exist for a few days. 

I got mad and put a password on the thing but since everyone else needs it i gave the password to my dad and sister. She's the only locked out person and is currently extremely angry over that - claims i had no right to do that and sees nothing wrong with what she did. 

Is what i did unnecessarily petty? Did i go overboard? I did basically single her out but i felt really violated in that moment",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,-0.013789835,0,1
31,1c8bub5,AITA for kicking my ex best friend out of my house after she stole from me? ,"Ok to start off, (Im 19F) I've known my ex bsf (19F, we’ll call her Chloe)since early 2019 and we used to be close. Even though our friendship was ok then, I noticed Chloe had an issue with stealing small things. Back around the beginning of 2023 Chloe moved in with us because she had been having issues with an ex of hers living close to her, and she couldn't continue living with her current friend because they were pregnant and needed the room for the baby.  
I didn't want her living so close to someone like that so I offered to let her move in, so she did. She moved into our basement which happened to be bigger than everyone else’s room in the house. I noticed she would always talk negatively about the girl who let her live with her before. We were about to take a trip to Florida when she moved in, so she came with. We paid for her. All she did the entire trip was complain and it honestly ruined the trip for me. Things just got worse.  
Chloe claimed she’d pay rent but never did even when we were struggling with money, started stealing from me and my other best friend (who we’ll call Maddy 18F) that she was already jealous of because my family liked her more and we’d known her for much longer, but Maddy was nothing but nice to her and even gave her a ton of cute clothes because her ex had thrown hers out and she never wore them and would complain about not having anything.    
I would have to go to her room and collect our clothes, makeup, and more. I woke up once to her sneaking around in my room (my door was locked btw) and she called me defensive for asking what the hell she was doing. She started becoming to rude to me every time I tried to talk to her, always keeping this annoyed tone and would always start arguing with me, calling me obsessive and manipulative for trying to hang out with her and making a joke once about how she’d rather I not exist near the end of our friendship and more. 

She asked if her current bf could visit for 3 days and then kept having him stay over for a whole month. After around 6 months of tolerating her behavior we told her she had to leave before Christmas, still in the nicest way possible even though we were all fed up with it. She did leave, although not without stealing an expensive perfume that was supposed to be my Christmas gift on the way.

That’s not even half of the things she did. Recently she unfollowed me on everything to “make it clear we’re not friends” randomly which didn’t really bother me, but earlier today I found out she’s going to the same party that I am tomorrow and she found out and basically called me immature and acted like I was in the wrong, saying that if i ‘start anything she wont play"". and when I mention how she was to our other friends they act weird, like they don’t agree with me.

34,1c8bgml,AITA for asking someone not to leave a tip for my GF,"I (26F) am not American, I just moved to America a few years ago from South Asia. Tipping is a very American thing, but I’ve grown used to it, and I make sure I tip well whenever I'm in USA. I understand how important it is, especially since my girlfriend (27F) is a bartender and basically survives on tips. Back in my country however, tipping is not a thing, and it is seen as a very offensive thing if you try to give someone money for something they do for you when they are not asking for money in return. Especially if it is between friends or family members, you don’t offer them money or a tip if they do something for you, because it is seen as a power play like “oh I’m paying you so you are essentially my worker”....that’s the kind of message it sends so it is an offensive power play thing to do in my culture.

The problem is, I have a cousin Nisha who still lives back in Asia was visiting me in USA last week, and I took her to my girlfriend’s bar since it is walking distance from our house and the only place that was open. Nisha is not a very close cousin of mine, and her and I are around the same age and have a history of being competitive with each other. I’ve had her in my life since I was a child so I still see her occasionally, but she always had a tendency to put me down whenever she can like, for example making sure the family knows that I’m dating a bartender while she is dating an engineer, etc.

Anyways Nishal and I had drinks at the bar, and I wasn’t expecting her to tip, but she pulled out her wallet to pay for the drinks, and then also grabbed a $5 and a $10 bills and asked me “how much I should tip your girl?”. I said no. I knew there’s a layer of meaning to what she is doing and I said we are fine she doesn’t need a tip.

Well my girlfriend complained that my cousin was cheap and didn’t give her a tip afterwards and I told her what had happened and gf was upset she missed out on the potential $10. I told her I can give her $10, or $20, or $30 if she wants, I just didn’t want to accept money from my cousin. But she didn’t get it, and now I’m the Ah.",Asshole,2024-04-19,1.0,0.0770298,0,0
35,1c8bcuu,AITA for pointing out that I'm getting up early because of my wife's decision?,"My wife and I are in well paying jobs. We're not rich, but comfortable. Despite this, she likes to work additional, optional shifts every few Saturdays. I'm not a fan as I think that it limits our weekends having worked all week. I feel it should be quality time with our small kids, or catching up with people etc. She claims it's income we need, I would suggest it's more ""nice to have"". I've told her this, we've disagreed, but ultimately I've told her I'll support her decision. 

I wouldn't say we've ""fought"" over this - we've a great relationship and get on really well. She's my best friend, a great mother to our kids, the love of my life, and we communicate well, so we're not prone to big arguments, but it is something we've debated alot. Her doing this means that we need to plan our weekends around these shifts and it can and does impact on my free time.

Because these shifts are optional, they are at her discretion as to when she works them, so she will ask me in advance if I've any plans before committing. While this obviously doesn't help any spontaneous outings - friends wanting to go to a game on a whim, or out for drinks or whatever (and I've had to turn this kind of stuff down) - at least I know if there's something I want to do I can flag it.

I'm into records. Not in a big way, about 130 records bought over 15 years or so, but I like to get stuff from artists I like. Record Store Day is tomorrow, an artist I like has an RSD exclusive coming out. My local store has warned me that the demand for this record outstrips their supply. They reckon it falls into the ""won't fly off the shelf straight away, but will be gone by the end of the day"" category.

When she came to me last month and asked me if there's any Saturday in April that doesn't suit I only said RSD and told her the date. She went off, booked her days and.... booked RSD. When she told me I said it was RSD, how I had mentioned as much, and she said sorry, she forgot. 

Last year she was working RSD (this time was my fault, didn't flag it) and I thought I'd be able to pop in the morning and be home in time to be with the kids for her to leave for work. This was naive, there was a queue to get in at opening time and then a long queue to pay, meaning I was later than hoped getting home and she was unhappy at being under pressure to be on time.

Tonight I said I was going to bed early, and she asked why. I told her I plan to get to the store early so I can be further up the queue when they open. She laughed at this and I asked why. She said she thought it was a strange thing to get up for.

I said I'm doing it so I can be home earlier for her to get to work and her face fell. Not happy. She said ""ok I get it"" sharply and went to bed before me, no goodnight.

Obviously the subtext here is she thinks I'm an asshole for making her feel bad that I have to get up early because she decided to work. I feel like I just answered the question I was asked; I'm going earlier to get back sooner.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,1.0415014,1,0

I do my hardest to make her feel special but for some reason shes constantly scared of me leaving her. Yesterday night we argued over something her friend did and we resolved it pretty quick. She was completely fine but then she watched a sad video on tiktok and got in her feels. She started crying and saying im sorry and how she feels like she is bothering me. This has happened multiple times and I usually reassurce her but this time I got kind of annoyed. I had just came back from the gym and she’s calling me crying.

( to clarify they never once made it official ever)

she ended up leaving him and talking to a new guy, but in between that i introduced her to one of my guy friends that i knew was a good guy and would treat her very good (mind you that is the worst mistake you can ever make) she ended up messing around with both of them at the same time ( which is so unbelievable.. so she was stuck between 3 men.. one was rich the second was better looking and the other was mixed between the other two, she stopped talking to my guy friend  and the rich guy and stayed with the better looking one mind you he’s 15M..

there so much more to say about the whole situation i just want to know if im the asshole or not…

after i cut contact with the rich guy i’ve realized you don’t always have to take your bestfriend side with this type of situation the rich guy was getting f#cked over so hard by her… and i felt bad for him really bad cuz he wasn’t just all about money he was actually very sweet and kind to her spent a lot of money on us and her (i never asked for half the things he paid for) except for my friend she just assumed he would just hand her what she wanted and sometimes that’s how it went… anyways skip to the part that apparently i’m the asshole for, my 3 friends all decided to make plans to go to the beach but left me out of the plans 

 didn’t tell me about them until last minute and i was very hurt and felt super left out (i was also dealing with something that day for an hour) but they just assumed i was busy the whole day.. anyways my friend ended up going back into contact with richie and we all hung out again and it was like normal, so i accidentally left my water bottle in his car so i text him if he can drop it off and he ended saying we can go get ice cream cuz i told him what has happened, he just felt bad for me so we ended up getting ice cream and i ranted to him about a lot of stuff that i was going thru and my attention of seeing him was just in a friend way
but now my bestfriend and all my other friends are mad at me and him because we left my friend out of the drive, but she was alr busy.. 
and apparently i’m not allowed to hangout with my friends man?( they never put a label on it and she was probably just using him) i also don’t have any interest in him (he’s not my type)

My whole life I grew up looking at my dad and mom, and my dad didn’t treat my mom like that once. He has a lot of respect for her so I’m basing my opinion on how a relationship dynamic should be from my mom and dad. 

When my brother comes over and he bring his girlfriend, when he does these things to her in front of us, I can actually see the anger build up in her face. I tend to talk to her a lot because he doesn’t even try involve her into conversations and makes her feel like an outsider.

2 days ago I brought this up to him when he came over to grab something from my dad. I asked him why does he treat his girlfriend like shit if she’s meant to be his girlfriend? My mom and dad looked at him as if they wanted to ask him that too. 

His answer was “deal with women, then come back to me”. I just said “maybe you’re just a bad person”. He just said I’m being an asshole to him and I should be on his side in all circumstances because I’m his brother and to not look at things too deeply.

Like I said, I don’t engage with girls too much and some relationship dynamics might be different I think. If that’s the case then sure I’m the asshole. If they’re not, then to me that’s just messed up because I couldn’t help feeling ashamed of my bro.

39,1c8ajb7,AITA for suggesting we cut someone out of girls night,"I have a small group of friends that will frequently plan girls nights. There’s about 8 of us. Sometimes we do nights in and we just order pizza and drink too much wine, sometimes we go out to do something (think smash room, sip and paint, etc). Basically on a night in everyone contributes to the food/snacks/drinks and on a night out we each pay our own way. Typically one person will make a reservation and then everyone gets them back. We make an effort to make some of these events more pay what you can afford vs something with a straight fee.  

Everyone except one member of our group, Gina. She makes less than most of the group, but not all of us, and there have been multiple times where some of the girls who make less have bowed out of a paid activity, but never Gina. Gina is always enthusiastically in for whatever we’ve planned. She’ll then put whoever bought tickets off saying that she can’t pay them until pay day. Then on the night of the activity she’ll make a huge deal about how she’s super broke to the whole group. Usually whoever paid feels too awkward to say anything to her, or sometimes one of the other girls will offer to cover her. To make matters worse Gina will also laugh and joke about how she and her girlfriend order out all the time, or talk about a new (insert unnecessary luxury item here) that she just bought to “treat herself”. 

Gina is a sweetheart and I love her, but it’s getting to be really annoying, and a few of us who have been left holding the bag for her have started to talk about not inviting her if it’s something we need to pay for.

I was doing an assignment for one of my courses but I started to feel hungry so I walked outside to my parents arguing in the kitchen. It was a small argument that ended up escalating as I prepared my meal. The argument builds and builds until my mom starts crying since she felt insulted. (I don’t want to go in depth into their argument out of respect for them)

I did not get involved until my father asked me if I understood what he was telling my mom. I told him that I was not listening too much and he proceeds to say “I want both of y’all to listen to me so y’all could probably get some fucking sense”
I asked him politely to not curse to at me. He explodes saying that “my mom and I are being soft and timid instead of actually listening to what he has to say.”

I let him rant for a while, listening to what he says until he brings it up again that I’m being soft and blames my mom for it.

I push back saying “I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to ask to be shown respect during an argument”.

 He argues that “I can’t tell him what to do and how to speak in his house since he pays the bills and if I don’t like it, I can move out”. Mind you, he knows my situation being a student and not earning a stable enough income to live on my own. 

We argued back and forth because he kept pushing his points to me, even after I said we disagree and let’s leave it at that. 

I basically told him that he’s being ignorant and arrogant and taking me asking for respect as an attack. He told me to leave him alone and I went back into my room.

My mom asked me why I picked a fight and I simply told her that I want to be respected in our home and that I believe that we shouldn’t be having such big emotional arguments anymore if we want to build a better relationship within the family.

I love my father, he has done so much for me and the rest of my family and I am forever grateful. However, I don’t believe because he’s the bread winner and provider that means he can talk to me or anyone in the house anyway he wants when he’s angry.

I kind of feel like an asshole because I don’t know how to approach the follow up conversation, and my mom thinks I should be the one to reach out and resolve it. Usually I would disagree and just avoid dad lol until he talks to me again lol but I want to do better at resolving conflicts.

42,1c8a16c,AITA for accusing my Mom of not understanding me?,"I (17M) am in my junior year of high school and was diagnosed with both epilepsy and ADHD in the past 3 months. Since then, I've had a hard time adjusting to my meds and have been extremely stressed out between schoolwork and college admission stuff. My dad is also diagnosed with ADD, but his doesn't interfere with his life as much as mine does. 

So Mom an I have been meeting with a college admission advisor/tutor for about the past year now. Recently they suggested that I take an additional AP Test for an English class that I will not take before the end of senior year. English is my least favorite subject, and I'm not too excited about taking it. Whenever I try to say that I don't really want to take the test, Mom always overpowers me and tells me that it will look better on my college application and will let me skip an English class in college. 

Everything boiled over on the way back from the latest tutoring session. In the session itself, it came up that I had put off emailing the test coordinator to schedule the test(I'll be the first to admit it was entirely my fault. Part of it is because I do not want to take the test in the first place, partially because my brain went ADHD.). In the session, my mom needled me pretty casually & lightheartedly about how  I had not done it yet. 

However, on the car ride home, she started to lecture me about how I needed to stop forgetting to do things like that, and made a big deal out of things she had casually dismissed in the session, like the email and how we might have to pay a late fee(which we can easily afford and is very small) because I forgot. She ended up saying towards the end of her lecture how she was tired of me lying to her by telling her I would do things and then forgetting to do them and threatened to hold me out of my national competition tomorrow if I didn't get it done. 

Well, that kinda made me snap. I told Mom that I wasn't lying to her and that I actually did intend to do these things, but I was stressed from my heavy course load(3 APs & 2 Honors, which she encouraged me to take) & meds, and as a result sometimes small tasks like that slipped my mind. 

She walked it back a little, but only really took back her comment about my lying to her and spent the rest of the car ride repeating the lecture in terms that made it sound less like she's accusing me. So I kinda called her out on it, mostly by saying that she didn't understand anything I was going through and was unwilling to work with me to find a middle ground we can both work with. Then we got home,  I ran off to my room, and here we are.

So, AITA? I know my mom just wants what's best for me & for me to have options for college. But I really feel like she's forcing me to do this and isn't listening to my concerns. I'm also starting to feel like her expectations for me are unrealistic. I kinda snapped and I feel bad about it.

After school had ended he had come home and proudly pulled a zip loc bag out of his backpack, filled with his most recent bowel movement, that his substitute teacher took upon herself to retrieve, bag, and send home with him so we could retrieve said tooth.

- he did not specifically request for this to be done 
- the teacher retrieved it AFTER he was finished

Today, the cat's distress was undeniable, and my sister agreed it was time. Despite calling my mom five times, she ignored the calls because she was busy being on call with her boyfriend. Eventually, when she came home, she and my sister took the cat to the vet without me because I couldn't bear to see her suffer.

She said it was too late, which hurt because she usually lets me stay out late. Then my mother called my sister, and they both scolded me for not being there to say goodbye to the cat but wanting to go out.

Things escalated when my sister accused me of being like our father and needing psychiatric help. My mom sided with her, saying hurtful things too. My sister demanded an apology from me for telling her to shut up two days ago when I was scared before a blood test. I know I shouldn't have been rude, but I was stressed (I know that this still doesn't make it okay to be rude, and I am trying my best to stay calm in stressful situations, but it can be hard sometimes).

I'm considering giving them both the silent treatment until I can move out. I feel like they view me like a monster or something. I don’t want to deal with all of this anymore ): and english isn’t my first language

46,1c89o4l,WIBTA if I told my wife I’m tired  of listening talking about their needy friend?,"TL:DR; I’m really tired of hearing my wife talk about a needy friend who is getting divorced. I’m tired of hearing about the friend but I don’t know if I’d be the AH if I said something about it. 

Some background: my wife (let’s call her “Lucy”) has a friend (who we’ll call “Ethel”) who lives in another state. Ethel is going through a divorce. She essentially got married to have someone take care of her. She’s never really loved her husband and complains about him a lot. And Ethel complains about pretty much everything

Ethel also doesn’t know how to adult. She’s never had to pay bills, work a full time job, rent a house/apartment, whatever. Ethel is a sweet person, but she has zero common sense. 

Ethel likes to call her friends and bitch about low lousy her life is, blah blah blah. She calls and texts Lucy probably 4-5 times a day, on average. And it’s always the same stuff.

Lucy feels it necessary to give me a blow-by-blow of the conversation, and how pissed off/frustrated she gets with Ethel. 

I can tune it out most of the time, but it’d be nice to have a moratorium on talking about Ethel for a while. 

Is there a way I can address this without feeling like an AH? Or would I be one just for bringing it up?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,0.98994935,1,0
47,1c89mjx,WIBTA for wanting my mom to pay for bathroom renovations?,"I 36f lost my vision suddenly and unexpectedly a few years ago. I was across the country at grad school but planned to settle there. It also has a lot of accessibility features that allowed me a lot of independence. My mom really wanted me to move home, a place I despise, and one day called and said someone was offering me a free house. I wasn’t given an option as she said she would cut me off if I declined. She was helping me out a little every month to keep me afloat but I was covering 90% of expenses on my own. Losing her support would have made me homeless.

I moved less than 3 months later, and the house was awful. No running water, no toilet/sink/shower, a giant hole in the floor, and major structural issues. The house is condemnable. Mom said she would take care of everything and it would be move-in ready when I got there, but I had to pee in a bucket for 3 mos before I got a toilet, and I only got a sink installed a few weeks ago. There are no plans for a shower 10 mos after moving. I have nowhere else to go.

I’m planning on going back to where I came from when I have enough saved up but that could be a couple years. And no matter how I approach my mom, she refuses to see what’s going on. She just says, “But it’s so wonderful your here” and remind me to be grateful, and that’s the end of it.

Recently, we went to lunch for my birthday, one of only a handful of times I’ve seen her since I moved here. She’d called off the workmen before they were done with my sink because she said she didn’t have the money to cover it. Fine. I get it. But then at the lunch she told me about how she’d just put down a $4k deposit on a cruise (she’s about to go on one, but this is another cruise) and another $2k on a trip to Nashville for her roommate. These were spur of the moment purchases that came after she sent the workmen away. For context my mom makes 6 figures, and while I in no way feel entitled to her money, she’s the one that dragged me down here and put me in this situation. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to have my basic needs met.

WIBTA for demanding her to follow through on her promise even though I’m planning to leave and write possibly break of contact?

48,1c89in5,AITA for splitting up our D&D party?,"Around a couple of years ago, I (21M) put together a group of people I met on Discord to form a D&D group to play every week. Excluding me there were 7 players  but the ones relevant to this are (fake names), Steph, Mel, Shane and Alice (a long distance couple) and their friend Maria, all within the ages of 18 to 21.  Shane, Alice and Maria were friends before this so they came as package deal. Long story short, over the course of a year, we play our D&D campaign and we grew very close as a friend group, to where we considered each other family.

Fast forward to October of last year, by that point we had agreed to make Shane the DM to allow me to tend to my ongoing mental health troubles. Steph, Alice and Maria (due to their close proxmity to each other) meet up to a convention in London with Shane announcing (to only Alice's knowledge) that he was joining at the last minute. The trip goes by and most of them rave about the great time they had.  


In November, an argument between Steph and Shane breaks out stemming from Shane ""feeling like shit"" that Steph was concerened that she couldnt make sessions as her schedule didnt align with Shane's. A month later and Shane announces that he kicked Steph out. Asking Steph, she said that no attempt was made to resolve things. After which I left citing my disappointment towards that as the catalyst as to why, on top of my joy for the game slowly fading. However, I remained on relatively good terms with everyone, Shane included.

However, after conversations with Steph, I learnt that both her and Shane were at odds since October, mentioning that he effectively turned her into a third wheel as he only wanted to spend time with Alice and when it was brought up Shane accused her of ""censoring their relationship"" (She got put aside so much so she had to leave a day early), that he ignored my opinon because I sided with Steph, that he'd refuse any resolution with Steph and that'd the group had sided with him because he felt like ""arrows were being thrown his way"".

Upon learning this, I got upset that she was treated this way and most of that they didn't bother to salvage the friendship I thought we valued instead choosing to cut her loose.

In response I messaged all of them an angry paragraph, effectively expressing my disappointment towards the group and my disdain for Shane for being (what I believe to be) the source of this as had he chosen to try to work things out maybe things could've been different. I ended the paragraph telling them to wake up to the kind of person they were siding with and telling Shane to go F himself and that I hope his dreams fail for the hurt and pain he caused me and especially Steph. Where I might be the Asshole is that I may have been too harsh towards the group and Shane as most of this stems from what happened to Steph and not me. Though I did what I did as I felt a hurt that a friend was unjustifiably being tossed aside for the sake of keeping the peace. Am I the Asshole?

50,1c88npy,AITA for threatening to erase my project for school? ,"Recently, I did a project for my school in which I was told I would be getting 75 service hours (requirement to graduate + scholarship money for college). Without going into to much detail, I had organized a large-scale fundraiser for our school from January of this year all the way through late March, which included meeting in-person with various local organizations, putting out social media advertisements, and managing the volunteers on the day of the event and during the planning period. I was also required to create a set of guidelines for the planning of future events.

When I turned in my hours today, the school went back on their promise and gave me 45 hours instead... I was not given a clear reason as to why and I was told this was not negotiable. Everyone got the same amount of hours despite the fact I got to work a month earlier and was in a leadership role. 

When I talked to the counselor later this same day, I told her that if I did not get the rest of my promised hours, then I would make the guidelines I created set to private on google docs and someone else would have to make them. It was about 26 pages long, and took me well over 10 hours just to compile all of that information. 

I was told that if I do not submit the guidelines, that all of my work will be invalid because I did not finish the job, and I will get no hours at all. That will deny me the chance to walk at graduation and get scholarship money. I was also told that since their office is busy every day it would be extremely disrespectful for me to waste their 'kindness' and the opportunity they gave me in the first place if I did not finish what I started.

My bf cries pretty much any time he speaks about or sees his father. There have been occasions when I've been invited to meet the dad but each time I've either come up with an excuse not to go or thankfully have been sick so I couldn't go. This man just doesn't seem like the kind of person I want to know and even if it's my bf's parent, he's a toxic person, my bf doesn't even like his father and only sees him out of obligation. I come from a family where I was physically and emotionally abused by the men in my family (who I've cut off) so I have 0 tolerance for that kind of behaviour. My bf says his father wants to meet me and thinks I should at least once but seeing the way my bf cries about the way his father is just doesn't make me want to see him. I get that family dynamics can be complicated so I support my bf maintaining a relationship with his father but I don't really want to be involved with that man.

53,1c88m5g,AITA for not inviting my flatmates to my wedding? ,"Me (29 F) and my boyfriend (28 M) are getting married this year. We knew each other since high-school and since then he has been my closest guy friend. Since that time we befriended another girl (let's call her 'Monica'). Monica became my best girl friend and we three were inseparable. 

Eventually me and Monica went to the same college and started sharing a flat with other two girls - 'Sandra' and 'Lucy'. Sandra  went off to work after college, and me, Monica and Lucy stayed sharing the flat. Monica and Lucy started hanging out more and became really close. 

At that time, me and my now boyfriend started talking more and realised we had feelings for each other. After I confided in them, they discouraged me from pursuing a relationship with him, making me doubt my feelings.

Despite their disapproval, my boyfriend and I continued our relationship. However, Monica and Lucy's behavior became increasingly toxic. They would exclude me from activities, criticize my choices, and predict that my boyfriend would eventually leave me. Their negativity began to take a toll on my mental health.

Seeking guidance, I started therapy and realized that their behavior was harmful to me (not only regarding this, but other things too). I made the difficult decision to leave our shared apartment, even though I paid the lease to avoid inconveniencing them. 

I moved in with my boyfriend, and our relationship flourished. Eventually, he proposed, and I happily accepted.

Since leaving the apartment, I've distanced myself from Monica and Lucy. While we work in the same building, our interactions are strictly professional, and we haven't maintained a close friendship. When it came to the point of arranging the guest list, I didn't even thought there was a point in inviting someone that would not be happy for me and my boyfriend. 

Recently, when Monica found out about my wedding plans and realized she wasn't invited, she became angry, accusing me of being ungrateful person and only caring about my boyfriend. Some work colleagues and close friends think I should have avoid this non sense and invite them anyway.

54,1c87xiw,AITA for not paying my sister-in-law for 2 months because the car she let me borrow had no tags.,"Yall I need some help from you guys to make this make sense for me. And for them.
Here's a little backstory. I want to say back in September 2023 end of August 2023 my sister-in-law (we will call her Marie) had came to me and asked if I wanted to borrow her car until we were able to get the car that we had bought fixed.
Mind you Marie came to me I didn't go to her. 

Marie asked if I wanted to borrow the car as long as I wanted and to pay them whenever we are able to pay them. We didn't set a date on when I'm supposed to pay the money. My husband and I had just recently taken in three of our niece and nephews in, plus we have three of our own children. So because  of that she wanted to help us out by offering her bigger car for us to drive around to get these kids where they need to get to. 

Marie told me that I would have to pay her $250 every month in order to use it. Which I understand she's letting me use this car but if anything happens she will get her money worth from it,  God forbid if anything happens like if I crashed it.

 So fast forward to February 2024 I noticed that the tags were expired they had expired back in December of 2023. So I brought that to Marie's attention and she  had said  ""okay we'll get it situated. You don't have to bring the car back for me to get the tags registered.

 So I waited now it's April almost May of 2024 and I still have not received any tags. After a month had passed with no information about the tags or anything. I decided that I am not going to pay for the car until I got the tags for it. 

To me I don't find that that is fair that Marie is willing to have me drive this car with no tags and to drive in this car with no tags with my children. To be honest I haven't really been driving the car because I'm afraid to get pulled over and get a ticket. 

And then expecting me to pay Marie the two months that I did not pay which was the month of March and April. So now Marie isn't going to get the tags until I pay her the two months. To top it off the car is not in mint condition.

 The back two doors are stuck in child lock, the driver's door window don't roll down, the fuel valve sounds like it's going to go out, the tags are expired, one of the front lights don't work, the AC nor the heater don't work. You can't see if you're putting the ignition in drive,reverse or neutral. Now that I think about it this was not a safe car to even be driving but I needed it and the kids had to get to their appointments. And it's hard to take the bus with six kids.

My bestfriend has recently gotten into a situationship with her ex boyfriend whom she was still friends with after they broke up a couple of years ago.

I was basically third wheeling(which is something I terribly hate) and I asked for one of my friends to stay with me so I don’t look lonely. She kept asking me what we should do when I already had suggested to do something, but I think she wanted to spend time with her ex. 

I got fed up and left with my friend and she told me she would be right there with me. I called her to let her that my mom was about to pick us up since she was going to spend the whole day with me.

In talking with another friend of ours ('Sarah', 33F), I mentioned how Miranda stopped talking to me because I told her to quit hitting on me.

Here's where it gets fun: Sarah tells Miranda that she makes me uncomfortable. Now, I myself am a bisexual woman, so she wasn't making me uncomfortable because she's a lesbian, but because I am married. 

Two of our other mutual friends have blocked me on social media now, presumably because I am percieved as being homophobic. However, they are still great friends with Miranda, despite her prowling on married women. 

To me, it feels like a type of victim blaming. It's not my fault Miranda was hitting on me, but telling her to stop because I'm married is apparently a step too far.

He has a mild intellectual disability due to some complications during his birth, but he's supposed to be able to function on his own. The thing is, he's always been a very helpless person when it came to taking care of himself - throughout his early 20s he has been placed in a few shelters for homeless, as well as mental facilities, but he always got sent away, because of his uncooperativeness and refusal to abide by any rules applicable in those places. He doesn't have a job, and he's been living in a social housing for a few years now. He has a poor hygiene, going without showers for as long as weeks. Around two years ago, he has been moved to a smaller flat, with no space for a bathroom. Ever since then, his personal hygiene became nonexistent, even though he has access to running (although cold) water. He also never bothered to clean his flat, and it had gotten to the point where the place got infested with vermin. He can't afford disinfestation, and the city refuses to help him. Last week he got admitted into a psych ward after an attempt. He got released yesterday, and was supposed to go back to his house. A few hours ago, late in the evening, he came to my mom's flat where I currently am staying for a weekend, and he wanted to stay the night with us, because he's ""scared to go back to his place"". I refused, trying to explain that there's no place for him to stay, which is the truth. He insisted, but I was determined, telling him that I can't help him.

I also forgot to mention that while his situation wasn't ideal from the start, it only spiraled out of control after he got moved to a smaller flat.

For your information, he’s been driving for a longer time than you have and I don’t appreciate you spreading shit to random people. The reason he was driving fast that day was to get us out of an accident. The Tesla is a fast car and if you didn’t want to ride in it then you could have driven yourself.

Cole had also said that Brandon had mentioned that he was thankful that Cole and their dad were at least “normal” unlike the rest of “us” who annoy the living heck out of him. 
So basically the rest of us are trash. 

I am highly offended by this. This is the most blindsided I’ve ever been by someone who is actively seeking something for free from me. I am not just a free lance photographer, I am a luxury wedding photographer in a large city.  This is my career and also someone who is going to be in my family? 

Brandon also had said some not no nice things about my husband while on this rant about us, and I’m having a hard time not making a phone call directly to the source to confront this. I will always defend my own, immediately but must say I’m conflicted in causing family conflicts right before two large weddings are about to happen soon. 

Part of me feels extremely guilty and sad for Alissa because I do like her, we’ve never been extremely sisterly or close but she’s always been sweet and it really hurts that she was basically right there while Brandon sits letting everyone know that he has such a problem with us just days before this engagement session. I really don’t think I could show up on Sunday and play pretend after hearing that I am SOO annoying and the worst to be around. 

Would I be the asshole for canceling this session while also letting her know that I would not have hurt feelings if they didn’t want me there at all as I am now uncomfortable to be around them?  ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,1.0013231,1,0
62,1c86qti,AITA for not asking my coworker if she wants to have lunch with us?,"I work in an office of 28 women with different sections. There are 6 women in our specific room section. It's a smallish room so conversations are normally heard throughout the whole room unless hushed on purpose. This week has been kind of an appreciation week for the whole office and we've been eating together every day this week in our common area. 

It was discussed over a week ago that for today (Friday) that we would all order crawfish and eat outside since we have a nice park area on campus. Personally, I don't like much seafood and I really don't like crawfish. A coworker of mine, Kylie, also doesn't eat crawfish and there is another who is allergic to shellfish, Amber, who is in another section (All fake names). So Kylie and I decided to go get something else so we're not sitting there like fucking lumps while everyone else eats or stay in the office or whatever. We start talking about where to go in our little room and we talk about multiple times both last week and this week. We'll there's another person in our room, Carrie, whom does eat crawfish and had voiced multiple times that she was getting a couple pounds. Kylie and I have not formally asked anyone else if they want to get our alternative with us except for Amber this morning.

Well Amber asked Carrie this morning if she was getting food with us which I guess was a huge insult. Carrie came into our section acting up with sarcastic comments about us going somewhere and it being secret. Eventually she began berating Kylie and myself that we snuck around and didn't want to ask anyone (specifically her) if they wanted an alternative, calling us ""snakes"" ""low down"" and ""dirty"". To be fair, we never asked the full room, however, everyone else in the room had already said they would get crawfish, she was in the room many times when we talked about it, and almost everyone knew Kylie and I don't eat that and would want something else. When she started her rant I immediately tried to apologize for not thinking to ask but at no point did she even stop to even hear my apology. I did get a little sarcastic and petty myself and jumped up and dramatically asked if her or anyone else in the room would want anything. She still did not shut up to listen anyone else. I'm serious, it was like a five minute long rant with no breath.

I get that she's upset but that seemed EXTREME, especially calling us snakes. Like seriously it's lunch. I didn't take your job. 

I didn't say much after. I did say that there was nothing malicious toward anyone else and I tried to just do my work and let it go. 

So AITA?

Edit: Sorry I completely forgot to include that after this our supervisor came into our office and said we were not allowed to get what we had chosen for an alternative because she had heard Carrie's disturbance and since we did not include everyone or get it approved. I do feel like an asshole for not including people but I only didn't ask because everyone had said yes to crawfish already.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,0.12026885,0,1
63,1c86n6n,AITA for telling my weight management group to stop putting nonchalant messages about being unhealthy on the chat? ,"I (F30) manage/facilitate groups with clients to help them to make healthy lifestyle changes to help them with their weight management goals.

Majority of my clients in my group wanted a WhatsApp group setup, so with their permission,I set it up. There was the odd comment about going overboard with treats so I ignored it at first but it has been ongoing for a few days now and I had a client email me about it. 

The comments are light hearted and not ill intended but are completely unhelpful for a health/weight management group e.g. 'I had prosecco but that's made out of grapes so that's my 5/day', 'i ate my weight in sugar' pictures of afternoon tea, 'i can't drink this week so you have my drinks for me' 'oh yes, I'll have your drinks for you'

I was very wary of the direction the group chat was headed so I drafted up and sent a message to set some expectations: healthy lifestyle group, I'd expect the prominent themes to be around healthy lifestyle, messages should benefit the group and inspire/motivate others with goals. Please try to empathise for others that might be struggling with goals as they may not find nonchalant messages disregarding health goals helpful. Best of luck with your goals this week, I look forward to seeing you all next week. Hope you have a lovely weekend (and I hope the sun comes out too!) 

Anyway since I added that message, the group has SHUT UP and one of the clients left the group 😳

I should mention that I also added at the top of the message in bold 'please respond to this message with an emoji so I that I know you have all received it -thank you' 😳

I feel horrible that I've needed to 'parent' the group chat but since I'm running the group, I feel that I have to make sure it's headed in the right direction. It's also ironic because around 90%of the clients are much older than me - I'm not sure if they have understood my message as condescending -  a client in his 70s responded with this emoji 😂 ffs

I have a virtual session with them next week (and every week for the next 2 months) and I'm not sure if I should apologise or if I should stick to my guns?

64,1c86e38,AITA for expecting someone to pay half the cost of a parking fine that they caused me to get?,"So my friend “Skylar” and I made plans for me to spend the night at his apartment. I had never been there before, and when I arrived I noticed that some cars in his building’s parking lot had parking passes on their windshields. I wasn’t sure if I was allowed to park there without one, so I asked Skylar if I needed to move my car to find street parking somewhere.

Skylar told me that he’s allowed to have a guest park in the spot assigned for his unit, and told me a specific spot to park my car. I moved my car to the spot he told me was okay to park in, and then we went inside.

The next morning, I went out to the parking lot and my car was nowhere to be seen. I went back into Skylar’s apartment to tell him that my car had been stolen and we needed to call the police.  Skylar’s roommate then came in and said that my car was most likely towed because at 10pm or so they tow any car in the lot without a parking pass. (Apparently Skylar was supposed to talk to someone in his building management to get me a temp pass.)

I still had to call the police to get the number of the towing service that had my car, but thankfully I did find it and the impound lot wasn’t very far away so I was able to walk there and get my car. I was charged a fine of $186 for illegally parking in the lot and had to pay that much for them to release my car. I did ask them if I could get the fee waived if I had some documentation from the owner of the unit stating that I had permission to park there, but they said it didn’t work like that and I still had to pay.

So after that when I updated Skylar on the situation, I asked him to split the cost of the ticket with me and pay $93. Skylar said absolutely not because it was my car and so I was on my own. I said that wasn’t fair since it was his fault I got towed, and that he should actually be paying the full amount but I was only asking for half because I was trying to be nice as a friend. Skylar just repeated that expecting him to pay for my car was ridiculous.

I didn’t want to argue about it and I don’t think he even had the money to give me anyway, so I just went home. I complained to one of my friends and she said that Skylar was a jerk for not doing anything to help me get the car back and it was fine to be mad at him for that. But she said that I was a little over the line expecting him to pay for my car expenses when he doesn’t even have a car himself and that’s probably why he didn’t know how the parking lot works.

I don’t get this logic. I still feel like Skylar owes me $93 and is a jerk for not paying me. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,1.0615486,1,0

67,1c85aho,AITA for bringing up concerns,"Throwaway account 

Background: 

My (33F) partner (33M) and I have been together over a decade and married for 4 of those years. 

We started seeing a couples therapist mainly due to my own, solo, therapy journey due to my CPTSD. I was starting to notice some things that hadn’t stuck out to me when we were dating, but were still prevalent issues in our marriage. 

Due to my own trauma history, I have spent most of my life being told I was in the wrong for lots of things, many of which were completely out of my control or were silly to blame a literal child for. Naturally, it’s hard to determine when you’re genuinely wrong and when you’re not due to a lifetime of being constantly blamed and this is what I’m doing by going to therapy. I have a hard time trusting that initial judgment and tell myself to give most people a chance. I should also mention I was only diagnosed with ADHD a year ago and I’m not currently on any medication for it due to other health issues. 

The issue at hand: my partner has a long history of criticizing me for not cleaning the house the way they’d like me to. This has literally resulted in instances of them getting on their hands and knees to check my “work” after saying yes, I did vacuum the bedroom today. I kept assuming I was just not very good at cleaning and kept trying to do better. After many years of this behavior, we are working towards a resolution in couples but it’s been…slow going. 

I came home today with a full bag of groceries and the dishwasher had just been run before I left the house (I even added extra, dirty dishes). I also had a full mental list of small chores I was going to attend to after I unpacked the bag. Not even ten minutes after I get home, my partner is already telling me a chore to do. We had just had a discussion earlier in the week about this kind of tone and situation, because he had come home from work the other day and rattled off a list of chores for me to do…at 10pm and without even turning on any room lights where he would see I already attended to those very chores. 

He then tells me I am unreasonable and he is allowed to ask me to do things and he doesn’t have to wait until I’m done with my present task to add another one to my list and he doesn’t need to wait and see what other chores I’m going to do that day. If we’re both in the kitchen, it’s on his mind and he’s justified in saying something.

The biggest thing I have been asking him for is to not ask me to do something while I’m in the middle of doing something else, or right before bed, and he got mad and said I have too many rules he needs to live by. 

I know this turned into a mini vent but I’m frustrated!

68,1c855sv,WIBTA if i went on a trip without my partner?,"First of all, i want to say sorry for my English, as it is not my first language.

So, me (22 F) and my boyfriend (21 M) have been together for a year, and living together for 6 months. After 3 days of dating, he got into a serious car accident so i took care of him for a few months. 

Because of the accident, he couldn’t work for 8 months so money for him is a bit tight. We wanted to go on a trip this summer, but he can’t afford it, so we’re not going anymore which bummed me out a lot because my last travel was when i was 14, and i was really looking forward to it. 


A month ago, my mom called me and said she wants to go on a trip with me since she knows how badly i want to go. (This is the first time my mom can go too because this is the first time ever she’s debt-free). 
I was so happy and told my boyfriend, who instantly got mad at me for being selfish and leaving him here.
I was really shocked at how he reacted, mainly because I didn’t understand why he would be mad? He said it’s not fair to him if i would go without him. 

My mom would want to go to a traveling agency in june, so i have to make a decision by then.

69,1c853zd,AITA for scolding my niece for the way she's been speaking to her mom?,"My older sister Mia gave a baby boy up for adoption when she was 18. For many reasons she did not want to raise him and did not have the means to anyway. Abortion was something our parents, who she still lived with and took some time to get away from, did not agree with and they expected Mia to raise the baby regardless of any circumstances. But they would not be helping. So Mia fled before she gave birth and she put him up for adoption. I didn't see her until I turned 18 and fled our parents too, then we reconnected. 

Mia went on to get married and have three children with her husband. She was honest with him about the baby boy she gave up and eventually she told her children as well with the help of a therapist, who said it was important that they know. This was 2 years ago. The kids got therapy afterward as well.

The oldest, my niece, Callie, turned 18 four months ago and she decided she was going to find her brother and bring him back into the family. She made some comments even than at her mom that she never should have given him up and how could she not love him. Her dad stepped in and told her she was never to speak to her mom that way.

Callie found her half brother through an online DNA service. He had not used it to find family but to find out risk factors for certain things. He believed he had set his account and results for no DNA matches. But apparently not every box was checked correctly and Callie found him quickly once she had her results. She reached out and he told her he was not interested in knowing her or any of his biological family and to please leave him alone. He blocked her and then his account was gone.

Callie was so nasty to Mia after this and her parents kicked her out after she refused to stop. She told Mia she hated her, that she was a dirty little slut and a terrible mother. She told her she had no right to give up their brother and he should have been raised by Mia and raised with her and her other siblings and Mia ruined that and ruined all their lives. She told her she didn't care what she went through she was wrong.

Mia was so devastated and she tried to speak to Callie and prevent escalation but Callie is FURIOUS with Mia. Callie reached out to me after a few weeks had passed and she told me she wanted to live with me. I asked her why she thought I would want her in my home after she treated my sister so badly. She told me my sister was a c\*nt and she threw away one of her kids and denied them a relationship with their older brother. She told me I had no idea what it felt like. I told her she had no idea what her mom had been through and it was not okay to take out her half brother's lack of interest in a relationship on her mom. She told me I'm not her parent so how dare I talk to her like she's my kid. She told me I didn't have the right.

And I wonder if I did go too far.

71,1c84z5q,AITA for asking to pick up a few items at the store?,"My (F25) roommate, Jane (F24) had a few rules that I thought were pretty reasonable. One was we talk like 6 weeks before our lease ends to see if we want to renew it and live together for another year and also discuss what we should approve on to make our living situation more bearable for both of us. We've lived together for 2 years now but about 3 months ago she made the choice to move out. She didn't even want to do the 6 week rule to discuss our problems.

This is why she wanted to move out:

Jane works Mon-Thur and sometimes get called into work on Sat. She always bring her dog, ""Coco"" with her (her work provides free boarding) but this past year I have offered to watch Coco when that happens. Jane always texts me to ask me if I need anything at the store and I wanted omelets so I asked her to pick up a few veggies. She does pass by a few stores on her way here from work but I know those stores don't have at least one of the things I asked for. I thought it would be easier if she goes to one store that I know has all the items. She called me and said she's not driving downtown for just a few veggies. I want to point out she likes grocery shopping. She has mentioned that it relaxes her. I also thought it would be easier since she doesn't have Coco with her, which she usually goes back to pick her up from boarding so she doesn't have to worry about leaving her in the car while she's shopping. She accused me of using her dog to take advantage of her. I told her never mind and I'm sorry for asking.

About a week after that, she told me she's moving out as soon as our lease ends. It's been awkward living with her ever since. Now she's moved out. Our lease ends in 2 weeks. And I have to move back in with my parents.

Edit: I expected people to make fun of me for only eating organic food. What else is new? You know you guys can give me a judgment without being mean?

Edit 2: I think people are missing the point of her call. Clearly she didn't want to go when she complained about the drive and the traffic jam. What I'm saying is she could have just nicely said ""sorry had a hard day. don't feel like going"" and I in return would have replied ""that's ok we'll have omelets some other time"" and that would be the end of that.

72,1c84hhh,AITA for implying to mom I won't help her and my siblings out after I turn 18?,"My mom is a single mom and we struggle. I'm (17M) the oldest and I have four younger siblings (14F, 12F, 9M and 8F). We have two different dads. Me and my 14 and 12 year old sisters share a dad and he walked out on us while mom was pregnant with my 12 year old sister. A year later she found another guy and he was bad news but my mom was so desperate for a guy and overlooked a lot of red flags. She had two kids with him and then he stole from my mom and left without ever looking back and left us in a really tight position. After that my mom would lean on me a lot and she asked me to step up and be there for my siblings and help more around the house and I did it because I wanted to help my mom. I hoped it would mean she wouldn't rush into another relationship with another dude who was bad news.

It was tough though. Like having to help with homework and feeding my siblings and being responsible for most of the cleaning was a lot. My mom still did stuff it was just she had to work and couldn't be there all the time. But after a year or so of that she started to take her frustrations out on me verbally. She'd complain about calls from my school (I struggle in school even still). Or if I forgot to do something. She'd tell me I couldn't let her down and I needed to act more like an adult and do better. When I was 14 she asked me if I could start making money and I did. I helped around the neighborhood for some extra money and I got a part time job a year later and gave mom the money from that. But it was like she'd take it all out on me more. If I got home late from work or school she'd tell me to cut it out and I needed to be more responsible. If a bill wasn't paid on time she'd tell me to be less useless or be more useful. If I couldn't do something she'd ask me what good was I doing. She'd tell me I wasn't a kid anymore and needed to stop expecting the life of one out of nowhere sometimes. Eventually I got so tired of it and it became so constant that I started saving money so I can get away ASAP. Mom doesn't know about it and I still give her the rest of what I make, because it's really the only way to save without her knowing.

73,1c849tr,AITA for not inviting my dad's wife to my mom's funeral?,"Like the title says. Some backstory: my mom and dad split when I was 19, she cheated on him with a friend of his and left my dad to be with this person. She was with him till he died 2 months ago.

 My dad already knew his now wife from work, they had been friends for a long time and got together about 6-12mths after my mom left. Stepmother was always weird with us kids (I have a bro &sis) and made it super plain she didn't like us or want us around. They got married after she stated that he either marry her or they split up but she never ever liked us and it was plain. Apart from to him.

They have been together for decades now and it's ruined our relationship with our dad as he's either turning a blind eye or just doesn't see it. And we were all devastated as after they split, my dad made loads of effort with us, which had not happened before. Of course, new gf syndrome means that wasn't going to last. Not one person in our family or his friends likes his wife and she has been incredibly rude to other memebers of his family (not just us). Whenever she attends big events she dresses inappropriately (think white *and* a wedding style dress at a wedding and a very short skirt to a funeral) and always wants to be the centre of attention. He accused us of being jealous of his relationship with her when we tried to raise it with him, even though we actively encouraged it and supported him to move forward. 

My mom got sick a while ago and was really ill. It then got progressively worse and her partner had to get extra help in (my sister and BIL) as he couldn't cope. Eventually, we had to put mom in a home a month or two ago as she was too ill to care for at home anymore. My stepdad died a few days after she went into it (he was not happy about her going there) in a horrible car accident on his way to see her and she died a few weeks later. 

When I told my dad about mom dying, I asked if he wanted to go to the funeral and he did but he asked if his wife could go too and we all agreed that our mom would not have wanted her there as she didn't like her due to the ill treatment we received. When he was told no, he kept asking and asking why not even after we'd said it was against mom's wishes and that it wasn't appropriate. He stated that mom was the one who left him etc and wouldn't listen when we asked him to stop.

He left it for a while but the day after the funeral he called my sister and asked her *again* why not and we both told him to leave it alone and asked why his wife even wanted to go to the funeral of his ex? To which he said, 'she doesn't, she just wants to support me'.

It appears he is now not talking to us because of this and i am heartbroken and sad that my dad is so focused on this to the extent that he has.

I told him to get rid of his attitude and just get those applications out instead of putting the rest of us down, and he responded by saying that I was just ""salty"" I couldn't get into banking.

We passed by a jewelry store. The other guy commented to our girl ""You deserve the best so pick anything you want and I'll buy it for you."". He looked at me and said ""We can split the cost if you agree."" He knew I didn't have much spending money. He was putting me on the spot. Of course, I refused. He laughed and said ""Maybe, next time."" I felt embarrassed but I tried not lose my composure.  
  
Later, we went inside one of the clothing stores and ended up in the men's underwear section.  After looking at some of the displays, our girl flirted with us saying ""You know, I never understood the appeal of boxer briefs.  They always looked so ugly just like briefs.  I have good taste in men so I'm sure you two wear boxers.""  (I knew the other guy did not wear boxers at all.  He tried to wear them in high school for a week, but he stopped.  He said the boxers kept giving him unwanted boners.  He went back to his briefs.)  
  
I flirted back to our girl and said ""I sure do"" and pulled out just a little bit of the waistband of my boxers to show her.  I turned to look at the other guy to put him on the spot.  I think I got him since he had a ""deer caught in the headlights"" look.  He lied and said ""I wear boxer shorts.  I just don't want to publicly expose myself right now.""  Then, he points at me saying ""Besides he's lying.  He only showed you the waistband.""  I said ""Briefs and boxer briefs don't have fabric covered waistbands.""  He then reversed the challenge and asked me to ""Prove it.""  He probably thought I wouldn't be able to, but I was able to think of a way.  I said ""Once I prove I am wearing boxer shorts then you have to prove you are wearing boxer shorts.""  He said ""Sure.  No problem.""  
  
So, I got a pair of pants from one of the racks and asked our girl to follow me into one of the fitting rooms.  Once inside the fitting room, I took off my pants and I showed her I was wearing boxer shorts.  Now, it was the other guy's turn.  He said ""Fine.""  I thought he would walk off somewhere while our girl and I was in the fitting room or try to talk his way out of it again.  He got a pair of pants and went into one of the fitting rooms with our girl.  A few minutes later I heard our girl laughing so loud.  I saw them walking out of the fitting room.  The other guy had an embarrassed look on his face while our girl was still chuckling.  
  
When the date was over and our girl went home, he said I should not have acted that way about him not wearing boxer shorts. Am I the asshole for calling out the other guy's lies about himself and me?",Asshole,2024-04-19,1.0,0.099499285,0,0

77,1c83hf9,AITA for getting angry that my friends paid for my birthday dinner,"I had my birthday a couple days back and I had asked 2 close friends of mine to join me for dinner. I chose the place which is pretty expensive (more than 100$ per person and that's without drinks), and ofcourse I wanted to pay for the whole thing because that's how I want to celebrate my birthday and that's what makes me happy. I asked one more close friend of mine to join us last minute who doesn't know my other two friends.

We had a great night and by the end of it I realize they picked up the whole bill among the 3 of them without me knowing because ""I'm not supposed to pay on my birthday"". I later got to know it was the idea of my 3rd friend and the other two agreed. This got me really annoyed because I chose the expensive place,  I was over ordering the entire night so everybody is full and I had promised my 2 friends that's it's going to be on me. They shouldn't have been put in a position to pay. Ofcourse they wouldn't say no, but I feel it's a violation of a boundary I had set and a disregard for what i had communicated, especially since my 3rd friend doesn't even know them and sprung this on them out of the blue. One of them was also recently laid off and is not earning currently. 

I have been feeling bad the entire time and feel the need to take them out again. When I think of my birthday, I just don't think of it fondly.

78,1c83e26,AITA for refusing to let my half siblings come to my birthday party?,"So I (20M) will be turning 21 in a couple of weeks. I was raised in foster care. In my first foster home I was placed in the same home as my (not biologically related) brother. The two of us bonded in our five years with that foster family and when they were no longer willing/able to care for us it was decided we could not be separated because of how much we longed for the other when it looked like we would be. This made it harder for us to be placed but we stayed together for the rest of our time in foster care. Sometimes foster families would attempt to send one of us back but the other always insisted they would leave too. All we had was each other and we were determined to keep each other. He's my brother even if legally and biologically he's not.

Six-ish months ago I got some DMs through social media from two half siblings who had also grown up in the system. They met when my half sister learned she had two half brothers and he was easier to find as a minor and she asked for a chance to see him. I was harder to find but eventually they both found me and they were all excited and I was both surprised and also a little curious about them. I was never told about half siblings. We share the same mom who did not keep any of us for any real time after our births. It was exciting to talk to them at first but as soon as I mentioned my brother their tones changed and everything I read from them sounded so jealous and possessive. It escalated when my half sister asked me to stop referring to my brother as my brother. She said they were my real siblings now and they did not want him to be part of the family they wanted the three of us to build. I told them I wasn't going to discard my brother and he was always going to be part of my family so if they refused to accept him then they didn't want me either. They told me I should be glad I have them now and I said they were strangers, he was family and if they wanted a relationship of any kind with me they needed to accept my relationship with him.

They refused but continued to reach out and continued to try and form a relationship with me. They ended up cyber stalking my brother's social media and found out about my party through his public account and they asked me why he knew and was invited but not them and I said they had made it clear we were having no relationship so wouldn't be invited. They told me they had never said that and they wanted to come. I said they were not welcome. My half sister said it was a shitty thing to reject my family for someone not related. I told them their attitude is exactly why I wouldn't let them come. They called me all sorts of names in retaliation.

I asked why not just me and him as we have done this many times and he kinda just blew me off, I didn’t ask anymore and left it be to maintain some dignity.

80,1c82ipb,AITA because I keep messaging my mom about money.,"It started about 2/3 years ago when I was just 18, eager to study abroad. My dad had saved about 20k for me (my parents divorced when I was three). When I turned 18, my dad lost his job and needed government support, but feared they’d see my bank balance.(As we lived together , even though we both had no income he was afraid they'd maybe expect for me to first use my study money) We withdrew everything and, as we were planning to move to different countries (traveling is big in our family), it seemed chaotic but necessary. We left the money with my mom and stepdad; they were supposed to send me money as needed for my studies.

This setup worked initially; I always had great contact with my mom—visited often, called, messaged. About 1.5/2 years ago, I settled in Germany, found a nice apartment, and got stable. I asked my mom to send the rest of the money (around 7/8k left after school expenses) as a backup. She said she’d handle it. Months passed with no change, though we stayed in touch. I asked again; she kept promising but nothing happened.

Contact lessened around November; she’d promise to send money and even birthday gifts, but nothing came. Last December was my birthday, and she promised a gift. Never got it. Nor did I get anything for the previous birthday. It was always ""I'll send it.""

As things went silent, a huge, unexpected electricity bill hit me this February. Desperate, I reached out for the money urgently. She promised immediate action; a day ended with ""It’s sent."" I waited a week, nothing. Calls, messages went unanswered until mid-March when she said she was sick from stopping a medication. I suggested she rest and perhaps let my stepdad handle the transfer, but no follow-up came.

From then, I sporadically checked on her health and gently nudged about the money (thankfully, the electric company agreed to a payment plan). She’s active on social media, changing her WhatsApp photo and posting for my sister, but rarely responds to me. Today, she briefly replied, ""I'm at school rn,"" then silence.

So we have decided that he will take care of all the household chores such as dishes, laundry and so on. While I work 5 days a week on varying shifts because I'm a sales lead. But back to whats important. As I was getting ready to go to work I realized that none of my work clothes were clean meaning I have to wear dirty clothes. Now I don't mind if I have too wear dirty clothes sometimes but I'm wearing clothes that I have already worn twice this week. I have a thing about not wearing the same clothes twice within the same week. So I asked my husband where all my shirts and pants were for work. His only response was ""oh I didn't know u needed clothes for work"". After he said that I kinda blew up and started getting mad telling him ""I asked u to do laundry on Tuesday and reminded u on Wednesday"". It's now Friday. I then proceeded to ask if I was putting to much on him by having him do the cleaning. Which is what he agreed to. His response is always ""no, I can do it"". So i decided to walk away cause I was getting mad. Yes I did pull the door closed harder than intended all so I could have some time to calm down. While I was in our room finishing getting ready he decided to start the laundry. Although he knows that we r both going to be leaving for at minimum 3hrs (he goes and donates plasma twice a week). So I stopped the washer telling him that the laundry is gonna need to be rewashed cause he started it now. And he should have started it after he came back.

My oldest brother was always successful and single until about two years ago when he finally met his current girlfriend. Amanda. She’s about 15 years younger than him. 

My brother always helped provide for his nephews because their father isn’t in the picture. He set up college funds and had him in his will next of kin so they inherited everything if something happened to my brother. 

My brother had a nice house and Amanda moved in changing everything about it from paint to wallpaper. I told my brother she was using him but he ignored me. Then he slowly started spending less time with them and more time with Amanda. He used to take them to trips to Disney World with him and last year he took Amanda instead because she never been. 

My brother who never thought he would be married or have children announced that he and Amanda eloped because she’s pregnant. 

I told my brother not forget about his nephews because they was here first and he promised them things. He said his life has changed and I was selfish for making him play dad all of those years because he felt sorry for me. I was super angry and I told him I hope he enjoys his life with Amanda the gold digger.

This might not be for everyone but in our community when a woman is on her period, we are to sit/sleep/eat separately in a different room, bed and basically be untouchable to everyone and especially the kitchen for 3 days. This has been followed due to different reasons in the past but now it has become more ... Offensive for a lack of better word.

In my family, we did not follow this ""tradition"", but am made to follow this at my in-laws.
So the thing is I hate it! Period. Me, being a science student would always argue with my husband (we are married for 2 yrs now) to just let go of this unnecessary custom because the environment and hygiene and health, etc are very different from then. But my husband is one adamant person. He's like when you have periods, its a negative energy?!?!, so just follow it. (This was the phrase they would use back in 10th century!!) Anyway so I just follow along since I am getting a 3 day break from household chores.
I have a very bad PMS phase from every symptom on earth, irritability, mood swings, joint pains, migraine, body aches, depression, etc. So this time I still haven't actually got my AF and its due next week but next weekend we are planning on travelling so I said f@@@ it and said I have it now! He of course has no way of knowing it. And I am better off taking a break during my PMS phase rather than on my flow days which is a breeze.

Oh mom she's out for the month so I am cooking/cleaning, etc first thing in the morning and my MIL would just utter stuff like Oh shit, oh ffs, oh no! ....

84,1c81vp4,AITA for blocking pda from my view,"I am not an English native so excuse my mistakes please. First of all I would like to disclose that I (16F) have a great disliking for pda/kissing (mostly kissing but from my experience the coupels in my school can't do one without the other). I had that since my childhood and no idea what caused it.

I know that I'm the problem in that regard and I've wanted to go to therapy for it and other stuff but couldn't do it yet (incompetent health insurance). That being said I am right now ""dealing"" with it by just looking the other way or holding my hand to the place where I see people kissing, because it makes me mildly irritated. I am not aggressive towards these people directly, just in a bad mood for a little while and others might also have the displeasure of getting to feel that so I do my best to avoid it. 

With that out of the way this is where I might be the asshole. I was talking with a friend the cafeteria and saw another friend of mine (16M) cuddling with his girlfriend (16F) and they tend to kiss. Since I could still see them out of the corner of my eye and I didn't want to relocate so I just used my hand as usual to block them out of my view.

After a short while the girlfriend asked me in an aggravated tone what I was doing and I told her that I don't like to see pda/kissing so I'm holding my hand up to avoid seeing it. She then responded (more aggraveted) ""then we can just leave"" and stormed out of the cafeteria and her boyfriend followed her after a moment.

After the break I had biology with him (we sit next to each other in that class) and I asked about her and he said that she was in the right, but we didn't talk much about it and he was to me like always.

I would understand her reaction if I had known she had a problem with it, but I've been doing that for months and noone never told me that they were bothered by it. The closest thing that which I can remember is her asking me if I had something against her and I told her no, that I just dislike to see people kissing.

My parents do not get along; my father is an alcoholic, and my mother is... in a league of her own. Earlier today, my parents were talking about how long it took for the water to heat up. What started as a normal conversation, escalated very quickly. My father made some backhanded comments about my mother using all the water when she showered, and she got angry extremely fast.  
  
This is silly. I'm aware. I prefer to stay quiet because they bicker often, about things I can't be bothered about. I stayed quiet this time as well, and when they started arguing, my father denied making any comment in the first place. My mother then turned to me for support, and even though I had my AirPods in, I /was/ listening to them. I said I didn't hear a word they said, and my father stormed off, and I guess my mother decided it was time to take it out on me.  
  
She started saying I never support her during arguments, and that translates into me never being there for her and that she hates my personality. I was shocked. I wasn't expecting that, because the argument was petty, and they didn't even get as angry as usual.

Because of the vegan food truck and the fact the restaurant has a reputation for good vegan, and vegetarian food, we were booked to host and cater for a very large and prestigious wedding. All of the bride's family are vegan, and so are most of the couple's guests, but the groom's family are not.

The wedding is in May and last week the couple sent out a menu choices email to all the guests with the vegan menu listing the dishes they have chosen. The whole menu is vegan including the cake which I am baking myself.

To make sure everything is both Kosher and vegan we are deep cleaning the kitchen the day before and will be doing a special vegan night at the restaurant so there is no chance of any cross-contamination

Since the menu email was sent I have been approached about 10 times form different guests who have asked for non-vegan food i.e they want meat. I have refused because it's not my wedding to plan and this is what the couple want. I and my staff have in each case said no, and please talk to the couple.

We spoke to the wedding party last night and they are happy we said no and sent out an email to everyone saying it's vegan or nothing.

The groom's parents have since exploded on the phone about an hour ago at us for 'dobbing them in' and ruining their wedding because they didn't want anyone to know that they and their children had asked for no vegan food.

Since the call we've had loads of comments on our review sites about how our vegan food is crap and not really vegan. I'm having them taken down but am I the asshole for not just giving them the food and keeping the peace?

TLDR: The wedding party want vegan, groom's parents don't, they want me to do meat for them and I said no.

I offered 2 months at first, but she was panicking about getting a better job and told me she needed 3 months. This would probably put me in credit card debt, but I didn't want her to go hungry or homeless. I thought she understood that because I go into debt in months where I have to pay all the rent. I was hoping she would find a roommate, but she was planning on not doing that for the time period that I payed all of the rent. A couple days ago, she got a 30k inheritance. Yesterday, I asked the plan was that I still needed to pay all of the rent. I said that maybe I could pay 70%, like what are current arrangement is. She got mad at me at first because I was asking her to dip into her savings, because she has lower earning potential than me, and she doesn't think she'll ever get this amount of money again. I said that I don't have a savings, so it's like I'm dipping into my savings every month. But now she is mad that I didn't tell her that I would go into debt if I paid the entire rent, because she said she would have said no to my offer of paying 100%. She is insisting that I pay 50%, which I am fine with. The debt part wasn't a big deal to me before, because she didn't have enough money to live off of, but now that she does, the context changed for me. Am I the asshole for not telling her that paying 100% of the rent would probably put me in more debt?

Edit: thank you for the feedback so far everyone. I have been feeling like I can't trust my own judgement sometimes in this relationship, so I appreciate your outside perspectives.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,1.0585198,1,0
93,1c80mpd,AITA for not wanting my kid to meet her grandpa at a bday party? ,"Hi everyone, I will be a new first time Mom come May. My husband and I will be having a daughter. My dilemma is that my husband and I were invited to a birthday party for his step siblings son, who will be 7 this upcoming July. The dilemma is, my husband’s dad, Jack, will also be attending this party.  My husband (Jake) & his dad, do not talk. Jake and his dad have always had a strained relationship. His parents got divorced when he was a little kid, about 4 or 5, and his mother struggled a lot as a single mom after Jack left her for another woman (let’s call her Liz) with children of her own, who was also currently married at the time. Growing up, Jake’s mom had primary custody but he was still expected to go to his dads every other weekend, and it was not a fun time for him. His dad and Liz went out of their way to express their dislike for Jake’s mom in front of him often. They were not kind to her, or to Jake. Despite all this, Jake’s mother was nothing but cordial to them, and very nice to their children as well. 
He had a distant relationship with them at best, and after he turned 18, only made obligatory visits to his dad’s maybe once throughout the holidays.  Then Jake’s Mom passed in July 2021 and would miss our wedding that Oct 2021. He was devastated. He expressed to his dad he would invite him, his younger half brother (from Jack and Liz), & his step siblings (whom he had an okay relationship with), but would not invite his stepmom. He relayed that he understood if he chose not to go cuz of this but he did not want Liz there, when his own mom couldn’t be there. He explained the same to his step and half siblings and they all understood & still came. After all was said and done, his dad was angry with him, but showed up briefly, then left during our first dance. He said nothing to my husband that day, just came to me to congratulate me. They haven’t spoken since/ Jack has not reached out to us. 
 His step siblings have always been kind to us and invited us to things, but Jake always chooses not to go, knowing his dad and wife will be there.  He sees his step siblings on his own, not at social gatherings. However, he has shown interest in going to this upcoming bday party. I feel for my husband, cuz he is generally a passive person. And although his dad has wronged him his entire life, I know he wants to try his best with him. However, Jack never takes accountability for his wrongdoings.  He never reached out once to us, even after we found out we were pregnant, I want better for Jake and my daughter. I don’t want Jack to meet her and hold her, and  act like all water is under the bridge. He’s hurt my husband so much, and I don’t think he deserves to see his bio grandchild without making any effort with his son. I want Jake to feel supported, but I also want better for both him and my daughter.    I especially don’t want to make a kids bday party about our drama either.

94,1c80bw9,AITA for telling my dad that I don't trust him to pay for college?,"I (16f) am a junior in high school and struggling with a lot of pressure about college. Apologies for formatting I'm on my phone.

My high school is apart of a program that lets you go to any of these 5 community college in my city for free up to 2 years. There is a university in my city that connects to that same program so you can go to that university for free up to 4 years. However my dream school is Texas Christian University but it's 14k a year, and I've resigned myself to using those two programs because I'd rather graduate with no debt than with 60k of debt or more.

I recently took the SAT and brought up to my dad on the car ride home how scholarships look at those scores and if I want to go to TCU I really need to do well but I was worried I didn't. He replied ""If you want to go to TCU we'll figure it out."" He used to have a good job but lost it he has a slightly better one now but we still don't have 60k worth of money to throw at college, we live in a shitty townhouse on a shitty side of town with a crappy van. My parents are also in the middle of a divorce and my dad is looking to rent a new place and buy a new car. In all fairness my dad grew up in poverty so it makes sense that now that he has money he'd throw it at everything for us. 

I still haven't gotten over some stuff he's done in the past and as a result I really don't trust him. Some examples: he used to take gifts away because ""he bought it so he can take it away"". He wanted me to open up at very low point but when I did I got threats of being put in an mental instutite because he didn't like that I would go to anyone and everything else but him. I brought up this in the argument we had about him paying for me to go. I also told him ""I'd rather go to college for free and graudate with no debt than go to college and be stuck for 15+ years of debt. If I can go to TCU on a full ride I will, but if I can't I won't and I don't expect or want you to pay."" 

He told me I was looking for excuses for him to not pay. I feel he's being unrealistic for putting a financial strain on himself and I don't want to deal with the consequences of his decision later down the line of I end up not being able to do anything with my degree. And I told him as much.

He got really upset and said ""Well I guess you don't trust me for anything now."" Which is partially correct but I didn't tell him that.

95,1c80750,AITA for giving my family a silent treatment in response to my mom's silent treatment? ,"The last Easter weekend at my mom's was a disaster. It's just me, my mom and my grandparents. My mom would not get dressed into anything other than her house clothes for 3 days. She wouldn't talk to us almost at all. She'd just nod, make disappointed or disgusted faces and say as much as ""yeah whatever, yeah i don't know, yeah who cares"".

My grandma (her mom) tried to confront her, asking what's up, telling her we can all see she's not happy, that we're here if she needs us to talk. My mom would pretend she didn't hear. To be honest, my mom is moody and silent treatments are her thing, but I've never seen her display that in such a rude way not only to me but also to her parents AND for that long. I'm not kidding when I say it was just me and my grandparents talking for 3 days.

On the third day, my grandparents planned to leave. They usually leave around 6pm-ish. When it was 3pm, my mom started packing leftovers for everyone (as she usually does), but she'd never pack them so early. We were basically packed and ready to go at 3:30pm. Very unusual for my mom and very apparent that she doesn't want us there anymore.

It's been 3 weeks. In the first week after that Easter weekend, my grandma would call me several times per day and I told her to not call mom, that she really acted very bratty and that she owes an apology and an explanation at least to her, her mother. Grandma agreed, but the second week, she stopped calling me. By the second week after the Easter weekend my mom wouldn't call me either. She texted me asking if I paid for her Netflix. I was floored. That was the first communication from my mom since 2 weeks. I decided to ignore that text and wait for her to call me.

Since I ignored her text, one week has passed (3 in total since Easter). Grandpa called me last week to ask me for advice on what bike to buy for my mom and that I talk to her to try to get some ideas. I told him that my mom hasn't spoken to me in 2 weeks, to which he'd said ""Oh, shoot!"" and just ignored it. From that interaction I assume that my grandma and my mom are talking again and since mom is in touch with her, grandma won't call me either, as she's either siding with her or she just doesn't need me to talk to her anymore as her daughter is back to that.

I feel childish not talking to them. But, it's happened in the past. My mom would give me the silent treatment and I'd still talk to her as if nothing happened, hoping she'd say something and explain herself. She'd not talk to me and I'd still talk to her eventually confronting her gently about why'd give me the silent treatment. She never apologized. She makes up reasons that are supposed to justify the awful feeling of being ignored, of being made feel guilty for no reason, of being a disappointment, of being bad support.

96,1c804lb,AITA for keeping a gift?,"I left a long term job recently on good terms with all except one manager. She was rude and condescending, but there were times when we got along. 

On one occasion, she said to me “hey, OP, my husband bought these winter coats but he didn’t like them, do you want them?” So I said sure! I needed a new coat anyway. She gifted me two of them. Turns out they were over $200 “designer” coats, and the labels were still on them because she had planned on returning them but chose to gift to me instead. 

I wore them for the next few months. Nice comfy coats. Then on my last day of my job, the manager called me an offensive term and laughed it off. I reported her to HR and she was told off by her higher ups. 

Apparently she cried in the meeting. Now she hates my guts. But I’ve obviously moved onto a new job now. 

Me and the manager have a mutual friend - and this mutual friend just told me that the manager has texted her, asking if I can return the coats that she gifted me…

AITA for not wanting to return the coats that were clearly gifted to me? I already gifted one and kept the one I liked more. I’m under the impression that no matter what happens, you don’t take back a gift…

This guy, let's call him Bill, always has to take a jab at me for no particular reason whenever we all hang out. He's always calling me things like ""air head"" and making fun of how I dress, etc. Also makes fun of the fact that he thinks engineers aren't smart (???) and that they have to be explained everything (he's a PM, I'm an eng).

98,1c7zrxi,AITA if I Pay 50% for 50% Outcome — Regardless of How Long Someone Worked,"We have a relative that is frequently not fully employed but is super talented and fun to be around. I am the relative that is always working with a pretty good income. Sometimes I have periods of famon and other times fame — the nature of the consulting business. But I am aware that my struggles even during those times are not the same as their struggles.

Recently I had a 4-month layoff with a bout of Covid. I went into savings and borrowed from parents to stay afloat — but my house was as mess. A horrible mess.  As I’m coming out of the downturn, and working again, the relatives’ sibling passed.  So we reconnected. They offered to clean my house instead of me calling in a lady that I’ve used before. I thought - GREAT - I’d rather give $$ to family. They did a great job and may have gained more business on social media (they did b4 & after reel).  I told them my next step was the full home laundry (curtains, sheets, spring, summer, winter, fall, garage - clothing). I needed it washed and folded; and then, I’d separate it for a yard sale. Cleaners stuff separated.

This week they agreed to do it using my washer, dreyer, supplies while we chatted. Fee for everything $250 and they said it may take an overnight to get it done.  This worked for me because I had limited funds and we’d get to talk while I worked (remotely); for them because the funds were needed.  We walked through the whole townhouse and pointed out everything that was to be included and they got to work.

Fast forward to the evening. I’m on a call for work at now 8pm. They pass a note saying “all is done” and they’re leaving to go care for their kid.  I think nothing of it and only look after my call.

What IS done is done FANTASTICALLY. What IS NOT done is “everything”. None of the bins are even opened nor washed/dried/folded.  None of the garage stuff. So I assume that they will return in the morning to finish.

The next morning they call and text asking for full payment. I ask if they’re returning to finish and they say no.  It was a lot of work and it was a discount.  They say I owe them fully even if they didn’t do the other things we talked about.

I clearly told them that I needed all done for the fee agreed upon.  I then say AND pay for 50% because 50% is what was done, regardless of the  effort on the work that was completed.

This relative seems to think that because I have more that I’m supposed to give my $$ away even if I didn’t get what I asked for.  I know that my $$ struggles aren’t theirs, but I too have them.  I too have a kid to take care of. And I honestly don’t have $$ to throw away.

Not to mention that both times I gave my last because I needed help but I knew they needed the $$.  I had to borrow milk money (for real) … so

99,1c7zo3t,AITA for not going on medication that traumatised me into an eating disorder?,"I (19F) have ADHD (as well as autism) and used to take medication for it. When I took this medication, I was in 7th grade and had been diagnosed with mental health issues as well. I couldn’t pay attention in school so I tried every ADHD medicine I could, but all of them had side effects that I couldn’t handle while trying to pay attention. I found one that had minimal side effects and started taking that one every school day. The bad side effect of this one, however, was loss of appetite. I was younger, so I didn’t think much of it when I started losing weight, but I became nearly skin and bones. I was so underweight that my psychiatrist said that if I didn’t stop losing weight so fast, I’d have to be taken off the medicine. 

Fast forward to about a year later, about half way through 8th grade I stopped taking the medication because it made me feel like a zombie. I already felt like I didn’t belong because of how different my thinking seemed to be from everybody else’s, but being zombified made me feel worse. The biggest issue was my weight. Because of the weight loss, I developed the belief that I had to remain this skinny because it was my normal weight. I was super hard on myself about, despite being malnourished and severely underweight for my age and body type. 

I was so traumatised by the medication and the eating disorder it caused that I swore I’d never take it again after I had recovered. 

Now it’s been almost five years since I’ve taken that medication, and I hate the idea of ever taking an ADHD medication again because I can function fine enough without it, it just takes a lot of effort.

I work in the same place as my mother at a law firm, I am a mail clerk. She will come into my office to see how I’m coming along and make sure I was focusing. We had talked with my therapist about the potential of me going back on ADHD medication, but I shut it down immediately. Five years had not been enough for me to heal from the trauma, and my mental health is still slowly recovering from not having good enough support as a, for lack of a better term, special needs student. 

My school really messed me up with the lack of support, which I am currently still mentally healing from. 

So today at work, my mother walked in and saw I hadn’t gotten much done, as is usual for me during early hours because I’m not very functional in the mornings. She got upset with me because I hadn’t gotten as much done as she knew I was capable of, and I felt bad so I went to her office to apologise. I explained that I had gotten distracted, and changed my clock in time to leave out the time I had lost dicking around on my phone. 

Her response? 

“Well then you should be on meds.”

So casual, as if they didn’t screw with my mental health and take away my sense of self. 

She made it seem like I was an asshole for not going on the medication, and instead trying to push through and function on my own. 

So AITA for not going on the medication?

100,1c7za8i,AITA for refusing to organise anything for my bosses 50th birthday. ,"We work in hospitality. There are only 6 staff. It’s fallen on to my shoulders to organise things like birthday cards, retirements etc.  we usually do a collection from staff and our regular customers, buy a card, flowers and a gift. 
 I don’t mind doing it, I like surprising people with a presentation of the gifts etc. we don’t do this for every birthday, just the big ones. 

In the last couple of years we’ve had a staff member turn 60, one turn 30 and two retirements.  We’ve always made a big fuss. 

I’m turned 40 last year. I took a week off to go away for a few days with family and then returned to work. My boss casually strolled past me and said ‘don’t expect any cards or anything. We haven’t done anything for you’. 
 I hadn’t been expecting the effort I normally go to but I did expect a card from them all. 
  I spoke to my co-workers about what my boss had said, mainly cos I thought it was really callous and cold. We all get along really well and we’re good friends so it was a bit of a surprise. 

 The most senior of my co-workers (f61) told me that she doesn’t know how to organise a card or a collection because that’s my department so she didn’t do anything. I told her the least I expected was a card from everyone and she said ‘I’m no good at stuff like that’ and that I’m the one who usually does that stuff so it’s unfortunate. She blamed my boss and said he should have done it. When I asked my boss why he hadn’t done anything for me he said it’s my co-workers responsibility to organise something. He said he did think it was weird that they forgot but said he’s not here to remind them.  He 

Fast forward to this year. He tells me he’s taking a month for his 50th later in the year and that when he comes back he expects to come back to a massive fuss. He’s expecting a huge collection because he’s the boss so our customers should chip in lots for him. I told him I’m not having anything to do with organising anything for him. Nobody made an effort for me so I’m not making an effort for anyone else’s anymore. 
 He said it’s about giving and not taking and that I’m being selfish and that he’ll be furious if nothing happens.  I told him he’ll be furious then.  


 He said I shouldn’t do things for other people because I expect things in return.  
I told him it was selfish of him to expect people to make an effort to celebrate him when he does nothing for other people. 

I told him that it wasn’t about them not doing anything for me. I wouldn’t have brought it up if he hadn’t pulled me aside and told me that none of them had bothered. It’s not like they forgot, they just chose to do nothing.  He just keeps saying it’s about giving and not receiving. I told him it’s a bizarre thing to say by someone who never gives but always receives. 


He reminds me on a weekly basis of the stuff he wants. I keep telling him to speak to someone else. He thinks it’s my job to remind someone else to do it. He thinks I’m just pretending im not doing anything.

102,1c7z0ov,WIBTA if I uninvite my brother’s girlfriend from my graduation?,"So I (25 F) am graduating from college in a few weeks and I was really excited. It’s only an AS but I worked really hard and I’m graduating with honors. The graduation is free and so I invited a lot of family, my husband, my mom and dad, step mom and step dad, grandparents, and all my siblings. But I didn’t invite my brother’s girlfriend. I didn’t do it to be mean or anything I just wasn’t sure I wanted her there. 

It’s probably important to know I am autistic and can get really overwhelmed around people especially those I’m not super comfortable with. This month in particular I’m nervous about getting really overwhelmed because I have finals, a trip to see family a few states away, my cousins wedding (also a few states away), and of course graduation all happening within two weeks. I’m very concerned I’ll get overstimulated and/or burntout and be unable to enjoy these big events, and so I am being very careful about where and how I’m spending my energy.

My brother has been dating this girl for a while, and she showed up for thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter and my cousins bridal shower. She’s nice, but she’s high energy and she’s trying really hard to make sure everyone likes her. I don’t dislike her, but the dynamic of my family changes when she’s around. Everyone’s on best behavior and everything seems more formal than I’m used to. I want to be comfortable at my graduation, and I won’t be if I have to be around “new” people. 

Today my brother responded to my grad invite (just a text that says the time and place and you’re invited, no mention of a plus one or anything) saying “oh yeah [girlfriend’s name] reminded me the other day. We’ll be there.” And my heart just sunk. I didn’t invite her, didn’t discuss my graduation with her, and so I’m not sure who told her/invited her. I want to be clear I don’t hate her but I was looking forward to this graduation. 

I don’t have a single photo with me and all my siblings or all my parents because my parents divorce wasn’t exactly amicable and so they’re never around together and this was my one chance to get a photo with all my siblings and step siblings and parents in one. And now I’m worried that everyone will want her in the picture too and I have no idea if she’ll last with my brother (who has never had a girlfriend last more than 6 months to my knowledge). Even if she does, she’s not family yet and I just… maybe I’m being a baby but I don’t think I want her there. And I at least want it to be my choice. Obviously uninviting someone to an event is kinda a jerk move, but I don’t know the protocol for when I never invited her to begin with. WIBTA if I tell my brother she’s not invited? Should I just suck it up and be a big girl?

His house is a 2 bedroom that was in a partially remodeled state (no hot water in the kitchen, no dishwasher, freezer didnt work, no doors and no flooring in most of the house, no washer or dryer). We paid him 400 a month for our one room, bought all our own food (even fed Matt and his GF lunch/dinner consistently) out of our pocket, we bought all household necessities for everyone.
  
   We had just saved up a fair amount and I disclosed to him we'd be ready to move out in about month so he could have time to adjust to not having the extra income from us. A few days later he came to me asking to borrow 300 dollars and said he'd have me paid back in two weeks. Two weeks went by and I told him he could keep 200 for half rent (as we were only gonna be staying with him two more weeks) and just pay me 100 dollars. 
   
   He then asked to borrow another 300 instead and said he'd pay me the full 400 by the next Friday. Friday came and he said he had to pick up his check from work (he never did) and said he'd get my money the next day (Saturday). I was camping that Saturday and said I'd be home Sunday evening and he could leave the money in my nightstand.

106,1c7xw7a,AITA for moving away from my family?,"I posted on here a while ago about my situation in wanting to get married and move away to the north of my small-ish country in Europe. Basically my mum was not happy and accused me of being manipulative, narcissistic, and depriving her of her future children etc. 

However, recently, I have been looking in to building a new house in my town since there are incentives for first time buyers to build in my country, 20k towards the price of the mortgage to be exact. My family own a bit of land and they offered to give me a plot to build my family home on. The catch is - I don’t really want to live near my family, and I don’t want to wait the possible years it may take to build and have all the stress that goes into it. 

Instead, I want to move to the north of my country, which is part of a different government (don’t know if you could guess the country, but it’s a very particular place that had a lot of troubles in the 20th century). I love this place and think it’s great, my boyfriend’s sister lives there with her husband too, I have friends there and it’s much more affordable. 

Though my whole family have advised against buying a house in a place I’ve never lived before, and suggested at least to rent for 6 months. I have been looking at the market and have seen some dream homes pass by the longer I wait, and I really am confident I want to live there. 

As well as that, they don’t like me moving to an area that has had a history of division and political turbulence (not in recent years, except in certain areas). They think I’ll really regret it and wish I was south again. 

This has all been making me so stressed out and no matter how many times I ask, my mother in particular always brings up new points or mainly repeats old ones. She talks to her friends whose children are buying houses in our area and compares me to them or says what they’re doing and saying I should do it too. She cries a lot and says she’s grieving me leaving her (I’m not getting married till next year). This has made me cold and ignoring, I don’t answer her much, I just say “stop talking about this, I’ve told you my plans”. I know it’s cold but no conversation has ever been fruitful so I’ve given up. 

Me and my boyfriend are in total agreement on this, and his family don’t mind where we go as long as we’re wise. 

AITA for ignoring all of these arguments and pursuing moving away from my family?

107,1c7xg6t,WIBTA for skipping my sisters(20F) birthday party?,"I edited my post since it was confusing, and a bit all over the place. I also forgot to mention some details.  
  
I recently turned 25, and my birthday did not go as I expected it to. Personally, it was a big deal since I view it as a milestone, and wanted it to be special. My mom wanted to invite the family out to lunch, which was very kind of her, but she had her own vision in mind and did not really take into consideration as to what I wanted. Now my sisters 21th birthday is coming up, and her birthday will be more extravagant. I am considering not going since I am still upset over how my birthday went. I am not thinking of skipping to punish my sister or because I am upset at her. I also felt like my birthday wasn't that important to people, which added to me being disappointed. My relationship with both my mother and my sister is really good, but I don't think that she feels that it's crucial that I attend either. 

WIBTA if I decide to not go to her party, or am I justified in my reasoning?



Some backstory: I have moved back home to my single moms(48F) house since my LTR ended. The break up happened about 7 months ago. I'm also dealing with mental health issues which is probably playing a part in how I'm feeling about all of this.

My birthday was on a Friday, and I wanted to celebrate it on the same day if possible. Everyone involved was technically free that day but my mom and her boyfriend were going to a party on Thursday, and in case of her boyfriend getting hungover they decided that celebrating on Saturday would be better. Even though I felt like it wasn't ideal - which I told my mom and discussed it with her twice, I agreed to it. It wasn't really that big of a deal.  
  
My mom had also picked out a place and wanted to invite us all to lunch. I gave some other suggestions on places I wanted to go, but at the end of the day she was treating everyone so I thought that I could let her decide. Later on, everyone was too full to have dessert, so we skipped that part. There was no cake or anything and the other guests went home right after giving me my gifts (which I am very thankful for), but that was pretty much it. The whole ""party"" didn't really go the way I wanted, but I didn't have much of a reason to complain. I was slightly upset about there not being any cake, or much of a celebration really. My mom just went straight to her boyfriend after the lunch, so it's not like we celebrated as a family, which I did tell her that I wanted to do.   
  
To be fair to my mom - she did however buy a small cake like a day or two before my birthday, but it wasn't like a celebration or anything. We just ate the cake, my brother took a piece and ran up to his room. I was upset since I wanted to eat together with my family and talk. When I brought it up, she said that she didn't buy it only due to it being my birthday, but also because it was easter. We don't even celebrate easter. I did apologise for overreacting, and that was pretty much it.

Sisters(20F) birthday is coming up soon, and she gets to pick the place. Later we will go to my moms boyfriends and have cake/dessert there to continue celebrating. The place she picked out is like 2-3x more expensive than the one we went to for my birthday, and my mom let her pick a place instead of choosing one for her. It also sounds like it will be a bigger deal than my lunch gathering, which makes me upset, and feels like she is being prioritised. 

 If our birthdays would be on the same level then I wouldn't be upset at all. But it feels like my sister is getting better treatment than what I did.",Asshole,2024-04-19,1.0,0.18090433,0,0
108,1c7xea0,AITA for potentially ruining some friendships?,"My storytelling skills are terrible, so sorry in advance if any of you struggle to read this.
Also, sorry for any mistakes. I'm not a native english speaker. 

To create some context, I'll list the participants of the event:

Roy - good friend of mine
Ashley - Roy's gf
Tobias - good friend of mine
Marta - good friend of mine

Around two months or so ago we were having a BBQ and some beers at Roy's house and later in the evening we decided to go inside because of the cold. 

Once inside, Roy brought a plushie ball and me, him and Tobias started to play some sort of football with it (trying to keep the ball in the air by kicking it from person to person). In our half-drunken state, although a stupid activity, it was really fun for us. Meanwhile Ashley and Marta were sitting on the sofa chatting.

As time passed, Ashley started getting more and more pissed because we were kicking the ball around, her reason being that she sleeps with that plushie and wants none of the dirt in the bed (they have a shitton of plushie thingies in the bed). At some point I told Roy that maybe we should stop and find something else to do, but he said not to worry because he will throw the ball in the washing machine once we're done with it. Alrighty, your house, your rules. We eventually stopped, chatted a bit more and me, Tobias and Marta left shortly after.

Two days later, Marta tells me that while we were playing, Ashley told her that no more events/parties/gatherings will happen at Roy's place the reason being, I assume, that Roy didn't listen to her and pissed her off.

Well, yesterday Roy invited me for a BBQ on Saturday and I told him what Marta told me and declined him. I told Roy I'd rather visit him when Ashley is not home in order to not disturb her and we can instead go to a pub or some other public place. 

After this I feel like shit hit the fan. Roy talked with his gf and told me that he didn't know what Ashley said and got pretty pissed because she was denying people/making rules in his house without him knowing about these decisions. Then Ashley called me and told me that she actually said she doesn't want big parties (we spent the NYE party there and it got pretty crowded and they (she?) had to clean up a lot after), but small gatherings are fine. Me and Marta have been friends for quite a while now and I trust her word 100%, that's why I imagine Ashley is now trying to rephrase what she said in anger to take the edge off it. 

Right now, Ashley is sad because ""we think of her as a demon that controls Roy"" and she tries to get in contact with Marta. Marta is sad because she thinks she made Ashley sad telling me what she told her and Roy seems chill enough. 

Looking at it objectively, this is pretty dumb and silly, but I can't help the fact that I feel guilty about this whole situation. I feel like I shouldn't have told Roy what Marta told me and should have just proposed to meet at a bar or something.  ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,0.31367302,0,1

I love her so much, but we have argued a lot when I was a teenager. I moved out at 18 and our relationship got better. A few weeks ago I visited her because she invited a few family friends and me out to dinner. My mom sometimes likes to talk without thinking how something can come across and she made a comment, basically insinuating that I was always too dumb to wash the dishes properly, so she never even told me how she wanted them done, because I wouldn't get it. I am used to such comments here and there, but also telling this story to our friends really hurt me and I just started silently crying and didn't talk much for the rest of the night. A few days ago we talked on the phone and she asked me what was up with me that night.

110,1c7wkna,AITA for expecting considerate bedroom lighting?,"Well, compared to many of the posts here this one is going to be pretty lighthearted. Get ready for Lampgate.

My partner (let's call her L) and I are getting ready to go to bed. If I get in bed first and L is in the bathroom, then I'll make sure the bedroom remains lit for her.  If I'm awake and reading something on my phone for example, then I'll have my own lamp turned on. If I'm going to sleep, then I have in the past turned my own lamp off, but I'll turn L's lamp on if it isn't already. However, if L is first in bed and I'm in the bathroom, then she doesn't do this. Once she's in bed her light goes off. She won't turn mine off if I've turned it on, but she'll plunge the room into darkness otherwise, even if she's not going straight to sleep.

The other night was one of these occasions. After brushing my teeth and leaving the glorious brightness of the bathroom, I was enveloped by darkness. Entering the bedroom, I can see the faint glow of her phone screen under the edge of the covers (so I know she's still awake). But between the door and the bed I'm now left to feel my way through a laundry basket and furniture obstacle course which is begging to give me a tear inducing toe stubbing.  As I navigated across the room and around the bed I let out a little chuckle. L asks me what I'm laughing at. At first I said ""nothing"", but when asked again I explained - I described the above difference in our considerations, but also made it clear that I found it funny. Because me precariously feeling and shuffling my way around the room like I'm on a tightrope was funny.

Cue surprise and defensive reasoning from L on how she couldn't be expected to do anything more or differently. This escalated to me explaining that the consideration that I give her would be nice to have myself, which only exacerbated things and upset her more. Which then upset me. Her main point seemed to be that she didn't know when or if I'd be heading to bed, even though she was fully aware that we'd both headed up together and I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth. So I lost my temper eventually and snapped that this made no sense and I was only asking for the same kind of consideration as I give to her and which seems natural. Queue both of us going off to sleep, back to back, in a huff.

So... AITA?

I'll stress that this woman is a wonderful partner and mother, and the next moring we both apologised and made up. She's truly beautiful throughout and this was just something silly. If anything, she stretches for justification in some circumstances where she's told she's somehow wronged or upset someone. But then she rarely wrongs or upsets anyone, and I'm hardly a beacon of perfection and infallibility. If anything, she spends far more time going out of her way to do good things for people.

UPDATE: Some people seem to have taken this far more seriously than intended, so just to be clear:

1. This was meant to raise a little laugh at the absolute ridiculousness of it all.
2. We bickered over it for 5 minutes and went to sleep in a bit of  a huff with each other - there was no full on rage-faced screaming match, no one was thrown through a window, and no bedroom furniture was sacrificed over anyone's head.
3. I don't resent my partner. She's the love of my life, the mother of my son, my childhood sweetheart, and if I stubbed all 11 of my toes navigating our bedroom, then I'd still love her to bits. I'm pretty sure she still loves me too.

111,1c7wjs3,AITA for encouraging my fiancé to be an asshole?,"Everyone mentioned is in their 30's. 

My fiancé is the sweetest, most agreeable person you can meet. Will literally help people till he's injured or cant sleep due to stress. He cannot say no to people, and will even go above and beyond what they ask of him, and people have taken advantage of that in the past.

I was recently chatting to my friend about people pleasers and mentioned that without me my fiancé would be a massive people pleaser. When she asked me to explain I told her that often he'll first approach me when someone has asked something of him, and he asks my opinion.

If I think they are asking too much or being rude I will tell him so and he asks me to help him write a response. This mostly means removing about half a dozen ""I'm sorry""s from his reply. Or saying things like ""I might be able to help at the weekend but not tonight"". 

Rarely I've had to put my foot down (usually when it comes to his boss expecting him to work for free/or his family insistently demanding things of him/close friends treating him like a slave/if we already have plans that were set in stone) and insisted he be more direct and say no to people.

He always gets the final sign off on his responses and we often say we balance each other out because he stops me sounding too blunt at times. Funnily enough we've joked he never has an issue saying no to me!

My friend was horrified and said it's controlling and manipulative of me to do that and if he wants to be helpful then he should. Said that he's always been that way even before I met him (she's known him two years longer) and it's not right for me to change him. And now if she ever asks a favour from him she'll feel judged and that it's not really him responding it's me.

I thought I was helping him but now I'm not sure and I hate the thought that I'm also taking advantage of him but in a different way.


ETA - one of the hardest stances I take with him is to not give people false hope. He truly hates saying no and if he really doesn't want to do something he'll say ""maybe another time/possibly in the future"" because to him that IS saying no. The problem is people then take that as a ""yes, just not right now"" and will ask again and again until he does it. In those cases I usually insist he takes out phrases like that or maybe/possibly/might etc.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,1.0615473,1,0

I struggle with my own mental health issues, but I try to help him as much as I can since we’re each other’s only friends and the mental health services here either don’t care enough or are so overwhelmed with referrals that there’s a 5+ year wait just for an initial appointment. 


This morning, we went down to the library as soon as it opened and got set up at one of the computers. As we’re waiting for the computer to load, I hear him say what I thought was “I hate this..”, so I reply, “Yeah it’s not fun, but we have to get it over and done with.” Thinking he was talking about his assignment, but then we get into an argument about how he obviously said he hates his life and wants to d*e and I should just go if I’m not gonna listen to him properly.

She thought she would receive her tax return money that same week to use for paying off her debts, but it didn't come in on time. That's why she asked me for $75.

 All of our other friends that were also sitting at the table they all got up and left, because I have no idea what was going on and they did not want to get involved. I stayed because I was very nosy and I wanted to know what was going on because she was really mad and I just wanted to know what happened, but then Suzy got up she walked away from the table and we walked behind her because we wanted answers.

once we were alone, she started explaining she said that she compared two black girls, apparently they were on a call and when Susie saw the girl's (we'll name her Amber) face she said 'oh you look like Gia (fake name for the other black girl)' that's when the girl got mad she was like ""you're so racist she doesn't look like me and you offended me"" yada yada. and then later that night Suzy got added to a group chat with all of that girl's friends and they all started yelling at her, throwing insults at her this and that.

Normally I would've had some sympathy, but I know her and she has said very controversial and racist things in the past. she often says the N word and we all correct her on that saying that she can't say that, that it's disrespectful and then she just excuses it with ""I grew up with that word"" which is 10 times worse than even saying it in the first place.

117,1c7sh9b,AITA for planning to not finish an art work & never draw for my friend again.,"I (28F) love to gift art for friends and family, physical or digital. I have gotten to a point in my life that I get commissions for my art now, which is exciting. My friend, (30F) let's call her Becky, also likes to draw, but because of some circumstances, even though she has drawn for nearly as long as I have, we both agree she hasn't really improved. Which has been a sore spot in our years of friendship...

Becky asked if i could draw an OC for her as an early bday gift. I had 5 commissions (pricing from $50 to $200) and informed her that I did not have time to do a full body. However, I could do a headshot for a pfp for now, then work on a full body character ref later. Becky agreed, I told her that it would still take time, seeing as she's getting work for free while I had 5 others waiting for their art that paid. 
I thought she understood until she started asking daily if I worked on it. I'd tell her no, remind her I have to do my paid commissions first, only for her to them move to asking for progress weekly. Again, I haven't started. Eventually, I did start and got to a pretty decent chunk done and sent her the almost finished results. I only did line art and color, didn't start on shading or highlighting yet, because it was not complete. I told her as much, she thanked me and said that she didn't mind waiting now that she knew I was still working on it.

Fast forward to a week ago. She starts showing off her ""artwork"" one day. I say it like that because she has sadly become an AI art user. (She'll draw her own drawing still... but then put it in an ai filter so it comes out looking better, then tries to sell it...) As I look, I realise one of the headshots of her oc looked really familiar. I straight up asked if it was my art of the pfp i made for her that she used. 

Becky: Yes I was too impatient to wait for you to finish XD

Me: ok...but your not selling it right?

Becky: God no! It's my OC I don't want others to use or steal it. (The irony)

Me: ok...as long as you're using it for yourself, I guess it's ok. (I then notice she re-colored a lot of the pic in the ai art) but if there is anything you want me to change I'll do it b4 the highlight and shade cuz that's the final process

Becky: nah it's ok. That's just the filter changing the colors lol. 

I get a bad feeling at this point, and I know she has a DeviantArt. (Note: I never used DeviantArt, so I never thought to look at her account until now) So I go to check, and what do I find, but that same headshot! Becky's advertising it as her own work.

118,1c7se5t,AITA for not working hard enough to get a full time job to support my family?,"I (19m) work part time and make 14 an hour but i only work about 9 to 20 hours every week. (i have only been working 9 hours because it's a slow time right now)
I have been homeschooled most of my life because i was bullied throughout my childhood by both students and teachers. I haven't gotten much education because it was just my mother (roughly 44f?) and my sibling (28m) and they both were too busy and when they did try to send me to programs, i wasn't able to learn much. However my mom passed away so now it's just me and my sibling, who i will call ""Charles"" to remain anonymous.

Charles is graduated and works full time as a driver at a delivery company and makes over 23 an hour and works 5 days every week, (6 days during winter) and works 10+ hours every day! Owning the house and providing things for the both of us. Charles does need me to give him money, usually i have to give him $400 every month. But sometimes the paychecks are either too small, or the money ends up spent on streaming, or i get carried away and spend most of it on my collecting hobbies.

 I have also recently had to spend over $100+ dollars to try a therapy session for the first time because i have undiagnosed depression and other mental health problems i probably don't know i have, a lot of days i don't even feel like getting up and cleaning and have thought about ""deleting"" myself often. I feel a lot of guilt for not working harder like Charles does but i am not strong enough to work like he can. 

Charles considers my collecting and spending habits stupid and he wants to be more strict about me giving him money every month because he is also having a hard time paying bills. He (and other members of my family) wants me to get a full time job soon and to work more on my GED and i am called lazy because i haven't worked hard enough on either. I don't understand the GED stuff, none of the places i saw were hiring, and quite frankly i don't have any motivation to do any of it. I want to support my family but i just don't have it in me to push foward, so i just let myself fall into a mundane boring routine where i do the bare minimum, if i have any energy at all, i clean something.

The thing is that getting a GED is extremely important, Charles even telling me once that if i don't get it, i should be put in a mental institution. I want to help him because money really is very tight. I can't afford therapy, Charles can't afford a day to himself, he has to deal with something else and is unable to relax and we are behind on a lot of things to take care of in the house. I want to help out more but i have don't have anything left in me to try.
Mom may or may not have been controlling and abusive (or i'm dramatic) but she and Charles both working kept finances stable. Since she is gone though, i feel stuck, but i just don't feel like i can handle a full time job as i am already at my lowest point. I can't handle all the pressure i have been getting, AITA?

119,1c7s17g,AITA for not knowing that the trash on the table were props for their video?,"This happened in my (M16) school, we had to shoot a video for an acting lesson, I guess. 

When it was our lunch time, group 2, consisting of ""JC"", ""Darren"", ""Blaine"", ""Lia"", and ""Cassie"" (not real names)., decided to record a scene there. I think their vision was for someone to clean and be a good samaritan? I don't know, as I'm not in their group.

When lunch was over, I saw them leaving their trashed table, I quickly had to clean up since the lunch ladies here are too busy to clean up as we have a snack time in the afternoon, in which they have to cook for as well. I didn't know that they were filming as our teacher doesn't really have our phones out at lunch, so when they shouted at me, telling me that they were filming, I just sincerely said sorry as this activity was 60% of our grade, I let them be after.

When they got up, ""Blaine"" was still screaming at me, telling me that they had to shoot for 10 more minutes after lunch, which got them some looks from the lunch ladies.

Now, here's where I may be the asshole. I said sorry and asked why it took them 10 minutes when the maximum time for the video was 3-4, ""Darren"" said that it was because they were messing up. I asked the question; ""Then why are you blaming me?"" as I didn't understand why they wouldn't just blame the person messing up.

""Blaine"" told me it was because my cleaning messed with their flow and that's why they messed up. I just told them to try to calm down and concentrate on what they were doing, and not what other people were doing.

""Blaine"" got mad, telling me to not clean up next time and just leave the mess since I don't know if someone might still use it.

I just said ""fine"" and ""sorry"" and left me alone. They still glanced at me, however. (Yes, Blaine and Darren were the people mostly involved here but the other people still avoided me, even though we are, or were friends.

Blaine, however, bombed me with texts, telling me to pay them tomorrow, as they can't believe that someone would barge in on their recording. I told them I said sorry but would not pay them as I was just wanting to help the lunch ladies. Blaine straight up called me and shouted to not care about the lunch ladies next time.

120,1c7rhwh,AITA for withholding rent from my brother because he does drugs and makes a mess of our house daily,"I (23F) live with my brother (30M) and a couple of his friends. For months they have been using nitrous oxide as an inhalant. They have a tank of it and it is VERY loud. Almost every night for months, he has a bunch of friends over to use it and I have such a hard time sleeping. They also make a mess of the kitchen and living room which is very discouraging because I will clean it then it will be dirty the next day. I’ve talked to him and told him that he needs to do it in the garage so it won’t be as loud but it’s still disturbing. I honestly don’t want him to do it at all anymore or to do it at someone else’s house. 

I want to tell him that if he continues to do this every night then I won’t pay him rent until he stops (I pay $400). Is this too harsh of a punishment? I’m not sure how to go about this but I haven’t been able to enjoy being in my own home because of it. Am I making the right decision?

122,1c7r8si,AITA for continuing to drive my work colleague home after he had a fight with another colleague of ours?,"So i work with a group of people, as most do, this story involves two of them. 

We’ll call one A and the other B. 

A is just generally not a happy chap and hates his job, it can be a real pain to work with him and this is shared with the others I work with too.

However he is tolerable and can be a good dude from time to time, he’s just easily set off and then he’s pissed for the rest of the day.

B is a much nicer person, works hard and is nice to be around, always good to work with him. 

B like a few of my colleagues weren’t fans of A but it got worse a couple weeks ago.

We all rock up to work and at the time only 3 people had a key to open the building. 1 of these people was actually working today, this person is A. 

Opening time comes and A is still not here, 10 mins past and still not here, he’s not answering the phone either. 

A finally rocks up 20 mins after opening, customers waiting with us at this point. He’s just casually walking. 

He gets to the front door and realises no-one else has a key except him. Now B would also be normally carrying a key but he had to give it to the manager and no longer had it.

Instead of A apologising and opening the door, he opened the door and started going off saying “shouldn’t B have a key as well?” and “Why can’t he be useful for once in his life and open the building as well”

It was pretty poor form, we go inside and start working, B’s getting ready to confront A, but before he can A just straight up leaves work and doesn’t come back that day. 

B wasn’t happy for the rest of the shift and we were all pretty shocked at how A just acted. 

I ask B about it the next day and he said he’s ok, he never liked A anyway so nothing’s changed for him. 

Now every week we all go to the pub and I usually drive A home cause he has no car and lives a while away, I’m not a fan of the way he acts at work either but I still do it so I know he’s safe. 

I do the same as normal after the pub but I rock up to work the next day and B is not happy with me. I ask him about it and he asks why I drove him after what he did at work a couple days ago. 

I could see why he was angry I completely understood it, but what was happening between A and B was their business not mine. I’m not going to fight other people fights without them asking me too. B said he was ok and nothing changed in the way he perceived A as it was already pretty negative.

I tried explaining this but B walked away and still has stayed pretty mad with me. 

I get why he‘s mad at me but I don’t want to start picking sides and making it possibly worse. I also don’t want to create an aggressive relationship with the people I work with?

The bassist in the band started it, and i was the first person to join. On Tuesday we had our first practise with our new singer, who didnt end up actually doing anything bc she didnt want to sing with an ""audience"" (two of my best friends came and watched) The practise was going okay, but the singer kept criticizing us, even though she wasnt doing anything herself. At one point, the bassist mentioned he was in another band for school, and was more commited to that one.

After the practise, me and the bassist were sitting in the train station, and the singer texted me, asking her to call her once i wasnt with the bassist. I showed the message to him, so we could discuss what the heck she wanted to talk to me about, but ended up guessing she might wanna kick him out of the band.

That evening, the singer called me and said she and the drummer wanted to kick the bassist out, bc of what hed said about being in another band. I hate arguing with ppl, so muttered something incoherently and hung up. I obviously told the bassist that the singer wanted to kick him out, and he started arguing with her on our band gc. The singer texts me immediately after, saying i shouldntve told him, and i responded telling her if she could please leave me out of it. I then receive a minute long voice message from her saying im the reason this arguement is even happening. I dont respond, and block her contact so she stops lecturing me.

On the group chat, the bassist and the singer kept arguing, until the singer left the group chat. The drummer apologized for siding with the singer, even though no one really blamed him, and we decided to recruit my really talented friend to be our new singer.

124,1c7qkxr,AITA for telling my dad that I will not be doing anything for Father's Day or his birthday,"My dad and I have a good relationship. This week was my 25th birthday and he didn’t acknowledge it until 8pm and he texted me. It made me a bit sad but he has a history of forgetting. In our family, each person gives a gift and we go for dinner. My mum got cake and made her present fun by playing a game. My dad didn’t get me anything which hurts a bit but it's okay. My mum said that she got a bigger cake because she wanted to share a bit with our tenants downstairs. I said sure and my mum told my dad to cut half of what’s left to share.

When I was about to sleep, my dad came into my room and gave me a giftcard to a cafe but I got him that gift card. That made me feel pretty shitty because I knew it was just sitting in his drawer. I said thank you and then cried myself to sleep.

The next day we went out for dinner and my dad paid. I put the giftcard back in my dad’s drawer because I felt like he didn't care and only gave it to me because he felt obligated. The day after is when shit hit the fan. When I woke up, I found out that my dad had given the remaining 2/3 of the cake to the tenants and my mum was pissed because she reminded my dad twice how much to give.

Later that night, I asked him why he gave all the cake away and he said “I didn’t give the whole thing”. I said that he did and that had no right and he just ignored me. I brought up everything that I had been feeling and he just waved me off saying that he did what he could (we are not tight on money. He’s looking at buying another new bmw). I told him that he ruined my birthday for the second time (first time was a whole nother thing) and he ignored me. I said that I put the giftcard back in his office and that he could keep it.

I told my mum what happened and he came in and yelled at her for turning me against him. He said that he didn’t even want to give me the giftcard and why should he have to give me a second gift when he pays for dinner. He only gave it because my mum mentioned that I put so much effort into celebrating them and I might be disappointed. I said he didn’t have to get me a second gift but giving me what I gave him at the last minute was rude. I did say shut up when he kept on speaking over me and I know I’m the AH for that. He blamed my mum for the cake thing and he claimed that she never told him to cut half.

I said that I won't be celebrating Fathers Day or his birthday. I’ll say it but no gift, cake, or dinner. He said “Good. I don’t care. In our country, we don't say happy birthday”. But on his birthday at 11am he asked us “why didn’t anyone wish me happy birthday?”  Also, there's a pricey concert ticket he wants and he told my mum that he thinks I’m gonna buy it for him for Fathers Day. I think it’s unfair that he expects all this but won’t reciprocate. I feel I might be the AH because it’s just a birthday. I don’t need a gift but regifting something that I gave him rubbed me the wrong way and then saying that he didn’t even want to get me a gift. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,0.03533909,0,1
125,1c7qjbq,AITA Disappointed me boyfriend won’t pick me up from hospital - AITAH? ,"My boyfriend of 8 months will not pick me up from hospital after surgery (septoplasty) after telling me he would three week ago. 

Confirmed during a call last night that he could still pick me up and he told me I should “look for a plan B” because I could not immediately confirm the time of pickup. 

I told him had just emailed my ENT to confirm the time and he showed no flex / refused to reconsider. 

This puts me in a pickle as the surgery is in less than a week now and I have no family, everyone I know works / has no car. 

Some of the reason I may be the AH:

-Boyfriend will have his kids

-Round trip would take him away from the kids 2-3 hrs (on school vacation while he is also on work vacation)

-I am unable to confirm exact time until day before (although I have a window already)

Personally I’m very upset. I feel there’s little point being in a relationship if I can’t rely on him for stuff like this. I also feel like he isn’t trying (eg he hasn’t even called the two people I think would do this for him in a heartbeat to ask). 

He feels that if I can’t confirm the exact time, that’s not his fault. 

Edit:  I can’t leave the hospital without someone else picking me up due to medication - they won’t discharge me (eg i can’t just take an Uber)

Edit2:  Great news, a friend has been able to take part of the day off and will be picking me up. Super grateful that I’ve been able to find a solution! ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,0.08238667,0,1

127,1c7qi5r,AITA for not offering to help my mum with her DIY?,"I (27F) got into an argument with my mum (67F) recently in which many topics were covered (she was a bit drunk and hard to understand) but one was that me and my partner (31M) hadn’t offered to do any DIY during a short (4 day) visit. 

While I am not great at DIY, my partner is a builder so obviously has a good set of skills. Obviously if my mum had an urgent DIY issue and we were there we’d sort it, or if she asked us to help her with something specific we would. But the way she phrased it was that she was upset and angry we hadn’t offered with my partners capabilities. For the reasons I’ll list below, I wouldn’t be happy offering out my partner to do DIY and I’m not going to make empty offers. 

We haven’t offered in the past (or on this occasion) for the following reasons: 
- my mum is comfortably wealthy (like “I’ve just bought a £2k rug because I like it and don’t need to worry”) and can afford to pay to have someone in. 
- her bf will often do small jobs 
- she doesn’t need anything doing really and has currently got workmen in to do some big jobs (she’s having a kitchen renovated for 20k). 
- we live a 6 hour drive away so when we visit we’d rather spend it on quality time catching up with family/friends including my mum. Often our visits are short because we’re short on money and need to go back to work. This is compounded by the fact that jobs often take longer than you think, especially with runs to hardware stores and troubleshooting. 
- my partner benefits massively from having recovery time with his job being physically demanding. 
- we live in a renovation project we’re doing ourselves and need an emotional break from the stress and strain this puts on us
- our car is small (we can’t afford anything bigger rn) and we don’t have the room to pack tools - so we also can’t offer anything beyond skills which she already has access to. 
- while my partner has skills he’s not proficient in everything and he wouldn’t know how to do a couple things she wanted (plumbing related). 

When her and her bf have visited they have offered to do jobs for us - but we’ve asked them not to, and have sometimes done jobs against our wishes (and major things like repaint the house white). So while this could be part of the ‘you should do jobs for us’ mentality, we have never asked or expected them to do our DIY. 

Instead of doing DIY we do - pick up shopping, buy her gifts and sort out device related issues (I sorted her TV wiring while visiting and often sort internet ect). My partner also helps with cooking/cleaning and is a very polite guest. But she’s not satisfied with this. 

TLDR - my well off mum expects us to offer to do DIY during our visit which we haven’t done because it wouldn’t be a genuine offer. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,0.025815656,0,1

I always found a way to work make the best of things despite not being given much from my family.     While my golden children in my stepbrothers (24m) and (29m) were given everything and were allowed to not do anything.     The (24m) stepbrother realized things will turn out bad if he continued this same path as the older step brother so he changed his ways and is going well with his life too.  But to give some context,   I was forced to pay for my own uni while they got theirs paid for.  I also had to 10x more than they did.  My mom and stepdad also have a son (9m) and I was the only one required to help out while my stepbrothers got to play video games.   But despite that, I found a way to make my life and career successful. 

But the issue is with the my older (29m) stepbrother.  Let’s call him B for the story.  B has a degree in Computer Science and graduated in 2020.  I understand it’s hard to get a job in the tech field but B has spent most of his time playing video games.   He works 4-5hours a week as a soccer coach while not trying to work.  It got to the point where his bedroom smells like a hoarders house. For those who don’t know, it’s a horrendous smell. Imagine some of the worst smells, and now imagine all those smells mixed together.    And I also am having to hear B scream on the mic every night too and I have work in the morning.   

I moved back in a year ago to help out take care of a few members of my family who were sick and to help take care of my half brother (9m). After they recovered, I was trying to move out on my own again. But my mother asked me to stay as she admitted I was a positive influence on my younger half brother and she doesn’t want my younger brother following my step brothers. 


Keep in mind, despite the time off, B never lifted a finger to help the family. And my half brother doesn’t even say hi to B or have a relationship with B either. 

Now here is where I might be the asshole.   I work in construction and I offered B many different jobs that people new to the industry can do and it’s easy to learn. Just until B finds a job in his field.  B said no and claimed I insulted him by offering honest work with a decent salary.    My mom (45f), stepfather (52m) and many other members of my family took B’s side and berated and insulted me.  I tried to explain that a job is a job and that B would be making decent money while waiting for a job in tech.  I also tried to explain that there are very good opportunities here too.  No one listened and I  lost it and screamed that I couldn’t sleep due to B’ screaming on the microphone, the house smells bad despite cleaning, and when I wasn’t heard, I told them to go **** themselves

I know they were disappointed that I left the medical industry to work in construction as I found opportunities that suit me better but I don’t think this warranted me being attacked by this. So, AITA?

I got home and she lost it at me. “Don’t you have a responsibility to your mother” I’ve been at home for the last week with her not leaving the house except for work, I told her a week before that I’m not going to be at home today (I’m a musician so I’m always busy in the studio, playing gigs all that stuff) she doesn’t like it when I’m not at home. She’s SUPER overprotective, hates it when I’m out of the house, calls me like 15 times AT LEAST messages me non stop, like I’m a grown man not a child. 

I’ve been having anxiety lately and she says it’s an “excuse” which I still don’t understand??? Like an excuse for what, she was a great parent don’t get me wrong, but never acknowledges my feelings only her own, because she’s has problems in her life if anyone else has a problem doesn’t count because hers are “so much worse” like she thinks it’s a competition. 

Last night I snapped at her, I regret it, but I don’t believe I was wrong, because my mental health has been pretty shit and she doesn’t really seem to care long as I’m not out with friends are supportive of me and take care of me instead she wants me with her 24/7 because she’s extremely over attached to me. 

Not sure what to do, should I apologise? Stand my ground?

134,1c7p93z,AITA for telling my SIL how my family really felt and now she will not let us be apart of their lives?,"AITA for telling my SIL how my family really felt and now she will not let me be an uncle to her kids?

In 2020 I called my SIL at night because I was in Vegas at a gay bar we went to together with my brother and his friends and it was their first gay experience. Calling to tell her I missed her and was thinking of them. She got upset with me for calling so late and said that I have no right to call so late. (Mind you it was 11pm) I was pretty wasted and then told her that, she keeps my nieces and nephew away from our family and only allows her family to see them and that all of us, including our mother and grandmother all feel like we are overlooked but out of respect for my brother we kept our mouth shut. Now it’s 2024 and I haven’t seen my nieces and nephew in four years and all I want is to be an uncle. So I shower them with gifts, even her, trying to get back into her good graces. Backstory, my older brother and my SIL have been together since 2004, I’ve pretty much grown up with her. She and my brother had my niece (now 17) in 2006. I had a job and would help them with diapers and formula, would be there for her always making sure she was safe and loved. In 2011, I met my now boyfriend of (11years) and wanted to introduce him to them and was told it would confuse my niece, which hurt because I’ve been out since I was 15 and my entire family accepted me. When I told them that, my niece if she knew her uncle was gay, would grow up loving everyone and could one day perhaps save some kid from feeling like he was a sin. In 2015 they finally get married and my brother tells me that he wants me to be his groomsmen but because my SIL niece was taller than me it wouldn’t be fair. So they choose our little brother instead. So my BF and I are in the background her entire wedding, we set up the reception, I helped all the groomsmen tie their ties, my BF made all of their bouquets and we were not thanked once. Now I have a nephew who is 4 and I’ve only met him twice. I am a successful manager and about to own my first hotel and all I want to do is share it with my brother and his family.

135,1c7p7a4,AITA for telling my boyfriend my family actually cares about me?,"I 19f have a bf 21M who came from a family of addicts and cut off all ties with his mom(dad was never in the picture) and basically only talks to his sister. Anyways he had wanted me to go out with him on a date but I told him we would have to reschedule because my dad wanted to take me out on that day. 

He had got all defensive and said why am I always putting them before him. He said there has been multiple times where me and him couldn’t do something because I had to do things with another family member. He also said it was getting annoying and that he kind of regrets dating someone who was so close with their family to which I replied:

“It’s not my fault I have a family that actually cares about me and didn’t neglect me for drugs” He got all quiet after that and hung up. I tried calling back multiple times and he’s not answering. Idk if I should text and apologize or just leave it alone.

Edit: I sent him a long message apologizing for what I said he hasn’t answered yet I think he might be sleep hope he sees it in the morning.

Update: I thought he would wait until the morning but he randomly FaceTimed me saying that he was also sorry about what he said as well it was basically us back and forth apologizing lol. Anyways tomorrow we are gonna meet up to do a deeper discussion as I want to properly apologize to him in person about what I said and I let him know I’m truly sorry.

Update 2: Okay we met up at this restaurant and talked about it. I explained multiple times that I was sorry and that I should have never used his trauma as a jab towards him. He also apologized for telling me to stop seeing my family. I told him I’d cancel the plans with my dad and any other plans in the future if it means we can continue the relationship as I didn’t want to lose him. He got all happy about that and now I’m over at his house and we’re just chilling together. Thanks everybody for the advice I got a lot of messages telling me how to apologize and what to say if I really wanted to continue going through this with him. It’s not a fully healed relationship yet but it’s a start. :)",Asshole,2024-04-19,1.0,0.9789402,1,1
136,1c7p1vc,AITA because I don't want to go to my husband's party!,"context I have been in a relationship with my partner for 3 years. In the first year I got pregnant and gave birth to a baby girl in May and we celebrated the birthday because there was no problem with my pregnancy. The month is very important because my partner's birthday is in April. Now I am pregnant again with our 2nd baby and I am 35 weeks and my due for the 25 of May. My partner turns 29 on the 27th and the same month his brother also turns 32 on April 20. They always celebrate their birthday together and there is nothing wrong. The problem is that with my first pregnancy everything went well, I never had any physical discomfort apart from the acidity, it was wonderful. Now with this pregnancy everything is horrible because my hip was dislocated and it is very difficult for me to walk and turn around in bed. This weekend my partner is going to celebrate his birthday with his brother and his friend who also has a birthday in the same month. My partner asked me as a favor if we could stay the night at his brother's house where the party is going to be and which is almost an hour away. At first I said no and finally he convinced me by telling me that it would be the last time since our son is about to be born but now two days before the party I no longer want to go.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-19,0.0,0.07624276,0,1
