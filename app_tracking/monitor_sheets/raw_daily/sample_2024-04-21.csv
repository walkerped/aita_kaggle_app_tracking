0,1c997wr,AITA for wanting my cousin to move out,"
A year ago my cousin was kicked out of my aunts (she is her aunt as well not her daughter) house because she wasn’t paying rent and wasn’t contributing to anything but anyways my dad being the “good guy” he always is he told her she could move in with us, mind you we are a family of 6 living in a three bedroom apartment in Ny so you can imagine the size of the bedrooms. My brother and I shared a room and my other two brothers shared another while my parents had their own. So when she moved in I had to share a room with her and all three of my brothers had to be in the smallest room it’s literally un walkable they have absolutely no space and I feel so bad for them. She also never pays for anything her only expense is $200 for rent. She doesn’t pay the light bill or buy food or house necessities. When we eat out we have to buy her food or if we go to the movie my dad makes us invite her and pay for her things and this just makes me so mad because she has a full time job making 19 an hour like why can’t she just buy her own things. But this is also messing up my relationship with my dad, he always wants to take her side I feel like he loves her more than me and I hate to say it but I am a bit jealous. He always makes me feel bad when I refuse to do something for her like call her to come eat or ask her if she wants to go out yk dumb things like that, he tells me I’m a bad person for not treating her like my sister and although I don’t treat her like a sister I have never been mean to her. Today he and I actually foght because we ordered pizza and wings and when I was full I was going to put my wings away and he literally told me to leave them so she can eat even though we saved her some pizza and the wings . I told him no because I wanted to save them for tomorrow and he got mad so I told him I would eat them now then even though I was full and that just made him angrier so I had to leave them for her. I’m just so mad and upset because why couldn’t bro just let me keep my wings. I just want her to leave. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,-0.004723171,0,1
1,1c99482,AITAH for wanting Christmas with my parents,"So our family found out my dad had cancer 2 years ago, all of a sudden my sisters decided that they would ask my parents  to go out for Christmas Dinner with them for the past two years but not ask the rest of the siblings, this year I have asked my parents if we could do Christmas together, to which they said yeah, bearing in mind I haven't had Christmas with them in over 20 years as I live away from the area they live in, anyway, they agreed, but I have since discovered my Mother isn't happy about it and has said that it's their tradition to do it with my sister(a 2 year tradition) but hasn't said that to me,.

Bearing in mind I did ask them and give them the option to say no and they didn't,

But also  up until the rest of the family were not invited to any Christmas meals, I made a very conscious effort to include everyone in any family gatherings until I feel my sisters selfishly  haven't..

 So is it wrong that   I'm wanting to spend at least one Christmas meal with them before they pass And should I Confront my mum about not wanting to spend with the rest of the family that never got invited previously? Or just cancel and not say anything and continue to feel angry because of the situation? 

The whole selfishness of my sisters not including everyone previously has made me not care anymore about including them in things and I feel there is no going back on fixing the sibling relationship, but also feel that my mother doesn't see things from our point of view and I don't get why she can't be  honest with me if she doesn't want to do it.

2,1c98t1k,AITA for telling my husband not to go to his family bbq,"My son has a school project due after the weekend. I work all weekend and my husband has the weekend off so we agreed he would help. I ordered the supplies they would need online and gave them ideas and confirmed they would do it today. We also have an apartment inspection coming up on the same day the project is due. My husband also said he would do some chores around the house to prepare for that. Last time we had an apartment inspection, I cleaned for 5 hours on my only day off that week, so I asked for help this time.

I get home from work today after working a 12 hour shift and my husband and son are not home. None of the chores have been done and my son’s project pieces are on the table not even started. I call my husband and ask where he’s at. He says he’s at his parents house having a barbecue and he’s obviously drunk. I get instantly irate. It’s too late at this point for me to do chores and help with the project. I told him his priority always seems to be getting drunk. He should have had other priorities today.

He says I am jealous and that they didn’t even have all of the pieces they needed to do the project (they got delivered while he was at his parents). 

We got in a huge argument about it and he thinks he should be able to get drunk on his day off if he pleases and I say he should have done the chores and project first. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,-0.003046437,0,1
3,1c98kva,AITA for introducing myself to some neighbors?,"So for context these people live down the road and their kids (9&6) ride the bus with mine (8&6). My kids talk about their kids all the time. My daughter and their son even exchanged stuffed animals for valentine's day, like little sweet hearts. The kids have been asking for several months if we could visit them. I decided we'd drive down yesterday and I'd introduce myself, give them my number so we could set up a play date. Only the dad and kids were there when we stopped by, we talked and exchanged numbers and the kids played for about 20-30 minutes before we left. My youngest son and their youngest son even hugged goodbye. I thought it was a really nice introduction, I was really hoping we could be friends with their family. I text the mom this morning because I wanted to make sure she had my number and we could talk about getting the kids together to play. She replied several hours later telling me she didn't want her son being around girls outside of school and they were old fashioned and it was inappropriate for me to show up at their house unannounced and to never do that again or else, because ""that's not how things are done around here"".  I'm just generally confused I really just wanted our families to be friends we have kids all the same ages. I don't know how I should have handled it to introduce myself differently. I  just replied to her text with ""sorry to have bothered you I'll tell my kids not to bother your kids anymore sorry"" I spent alot of the afternoon crying especially since I had to tell my kids they couldn't be friends with them anymore and they were heart broken. We live out in the country and all our neighbors we've met so far have all just driven over and introduced themselves. I don't know what I did wrong. When we stopped by, the dad didn't act like we were bothering them or we shouldn't have come over we had a really nice chat. I thought he would really hit it off with my husband.

4,1c98k7v,"AITA for getting up and saying ""I don't like you attitude"" when my mom said another girl could have my clothes without my permission?","Hi reddit, this is my first post here, and mind you this just happened (I'm currently crying while writing this).

For context, I (20F) always had clothes that were given to me by others, that really saved my mom (40F) when I was younger, and even when older I never minded having another people's clothes nor giving mine away, but this time it was different...

My mom has a goddaughter (17F) that I always gave my clothes away to, and I'm friends with her, because we have a lot in common and she had my body type, so my clothes always fit her.

Earlier today my mom saw my old denim vests and asked if I would give them away to her goddaughter, I said ""she doesn't have the dripp to wear these"" and I thought she understood because she didn't ask again. The day passed almost too smoothly.

At dinner time the family of her goddaughter came to dine with us, and everything was fine, untill my mom called her to go into the room and asked her if she liked my clothes and proceeded to put my favorite denim vest on the girl and said she could keep it. I snapped, I got up and looked straight at my mom and said ""I don't like your attitude"", she gone ""what?"", and I repeated and said I didn't give her permission to do so. The girl took of my clothes and gave it to me with an awkward smile.

I entered the room where my mom was and she said I humiliated in front of everyone, I told her it wasn't right to just give my things away and she proceeded to tell me she expected me to use those denim vests every day from now on as an punishment. Then she got out of the room and everyone acted as if nothing happened. 

They left our home, and my mom didn't talk to me until my dad brought everything up and gave a speech about respect and how he was sad about how I handled the situation. He was already late for work and said he expected us both to apologize to each other.

I told my mother how much these clothes meant to me, how they were my style, my mark, back in the day. She doesn't get it, she argued that I don't use them anymore and how they don't fit me ( an common topic nowadays, about my weight, I don't have to tell the whole thing, you get it ).

I just started crying and she left the room saying ""I'm done, this is not the first time you've embarrassed me in front of others"" (another whole different story that I already apologized for) and ""I left it alone, and I will from now on, I don't care anymore, I treated you right, I cared about you, and that's what I receive"".

My brother tried to stay with me and understand me, but my dad didn't let him, so I had no option but to talk about it with my boyfriend. And she's there, on the kitchen, talking with my brother, like if I don't exist.

My boyfriend says that I should get another job and be gone from home more often or just move in with him. He knows a lot of what I've been going through, he's my light actually.

I can't face her, I can't afford the courage to apologize now. I don't know what to think or do anymore.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,-0.0006355208,0,1

I was in a relationship with a (Male 45) and I was 27 then and got to find out when I was pregnant after he came clean because he wanted me to have an abortion and save his ""image"" he was so pushy and forceful about it that it scared me and we broke up and I had the baby in 2022 who he refused to have anything to do with. A knew about all this and wanted a ""relationship"" with me. I was alone with no family or friends and it was a difficult pregnancy and my financial situation was not good but I never ask him for anything. I kept using money for my feeding for data bundle to talk to him , which is expensive. I did it because I knew that was the cost and I wanted to talk to the only man who ever claimed to ""love"" me. I knew he was too young as I'm getting old but thought perhaps, this is where love is. He would always talk about his day to day and would talk on video for hours which was expensive but we made plans of him coming to West Africa for me so I was okay with it. He told me he ""loved"" me every day and it made me feel good because it's all I've ever wanted in life. Things were good, or so I thought because i have never asked him for anything and he's never offered to help with anything but I'm used to that because I've always been the one to give even with family. My phone got damaged and I couldn't get a new one sooner but found a way to let him know and he told me to ask my ex whom I've never spoken to and has never seen his child to buy me a phone and i told him i can't insult myself more than i already have by doing something so stupid and he laughed.

I had a really serious swelling on my middle finger that I couldn't work for a month that I lost my finger in the end.(I'm a braider) and I couldn't tell him him at first because i know that no one cares about me so it's hard to share with people. We were texting about it and he asked for a photo which I sent to him and he then ignored my message but was positive on Facebook. After 14hrs he responded with ""oh okay"". There was nothing I could say to that so I ignored it. The next day he sent me a valentine's day message professing his undying love for me and all. I knew it was all a lie at this point. I said ""thank you, sweetheart. I'm starving right now but as I've not been able to work in weeks and I have to take care of my baby's need and pay 2$ daily for electricity. Could you please buy me a plate of rice?"" And he responded with ""Hahaha that's cute"". Didn't talk to me or anything and I texted him two weeks later asking if he would have helped if I was American and that i never asked him for money as you can pay for food online and it would have been helpful if he hard scared 10$ for me.

I asked her to put it away so my car wouldn’t smell like the stinky food. She said no, so I took the food away and closed it so my new car smell wouldn’t be ruined by that smell. 

Today she was about to open a dessert that was really full. I asked her to wait until we got to a main road so it wouldn’t spill. She started arguing about me not letting her eat in my car. She says I’m rude for telling her to respect my car. I say she’s rude because I asked nicely and she just wanted to do what she wanted. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,0.06842472,0,1
7,1c98h9n,AITA for refusing to go to formal with my friend because of his outfit?,"Last week, my friend, who never attends frat events and isn't particularly interested in them, drunkenly asked me to be his date for formal. He's not heavily involved in the frat scene and wasn't even aware of the exact date or time of the event. He basically mentioned he was going because he knew I enjoyed it last year.

Fast forward to today, and he tells me he's at the mall buying a new shirt, just six hours before the formal. He looked fine last year, so I assumed it was fine. When he arrived at my house tonight, I was shocked by his outfit. He was wearing a white shirt two sizes too big, khakis, black (work?) boots, and no tie or jacket. I tried to remain calm and suggested alternatives, but he insisted this was similar to what he wore last year, which I knew wasn't true because I had photos.

Meanwhile, I had put in a lot of effort into my appearance despite waking up sick and going to urgent care earlier today. Instead of canceling, I pushed through because I was excited to go.

I gently suggested we talk in my car away from my roommates because it's hard to hear criticism about one's appearance. As a former fat and ugly child, I know how hurtful it can be. I didn't outright say he looked bad but mentioned that his attire wasn't appropriate for the event, and I felt embarrassed and disrespected.

I suggested that we do something else and anything else he wanted, but he became defensive and started yelling at me, calling me shallow, dismissing my feelings of disrespect, and other irrelevant irrational things. I remained calm and tried to explain my perspective, but he refused to see my point of view.

I believe feeling disrespected is valid, given the effort I put into my appearance. While I understand everyone has different standards, I don't think it's acceptable to show up to a formal event dressed inappropriately, especially when inviting someone as a date.

He offered excuses like his original shirt having a stain and it being too hot for a jacket. After I declined to go, he claimed his friend was bringing him a tie and he had nicer shoes. At that point, it seemed pointless to attend, especially after the argument we had.

I also suspect he was lying about the tie.

8,1c98f6f,WIBTA if I decided to stop pushing my kids to spend time with their dad,"I (30F) have been separated from my kids dad (29M) for about 2 years, things were going great and he was spending as much time as possible with the our kids (12F) and (7F) until he went a got married to someone he was with after 3 months. After that he picks and chooses when he wants to spend time with his kids. He gets them at the most two times a week. When he decided to get married he didn’t let anyone know not even his own kids. It honestly upsets me that he didn’t want his kids apart of a big life step he was taking. I feel as though they should have been included or at least told but he never even gave them the option. My oldest is at the point where she gets upset when I tell her he’s coming to pick them up, she hates going over there because she feels she doesn’t get quality time with her dad since this other woman came into his life. She’s always been a daddies girl and I can slowly see her starting to change. My youngest has always been attached to me and doesn’t ever want to leave me but I always tend to push her so she gets that time with him. I know what it’s like to grow up with one parent in the picture and I never wanted that for my kids but it seems like that’s the direction I’m headed. Should I stop pushing them to have a relationship with him? I’ve brought up these concerns with him and he says he’ll try to fix it but he never does.

9,1c986v2,AITA for agreeing to split the bill on a double date which ended in my best friend being dumped?,"Hi! I (22f) am really unsure here. My best friend and roommate (22f) Amiee had been seeing a guy for two months. She really likes him, it seemed to be going super well. 

Last night, she asked if I’d go along with a blind double date (ie. her and the guy she’s dating, me and one of his friends who is single and looking). I wasn’t keen at first but she insisted, so I agreed. 

We got to the restaurant, just a nice place in our area, and things seemed to be going fine. The friend she was “setting me up with” was cool, but I really am not looking right now and didn’t feel any kind of spark. 

We get to the end of dinner and the bill comes. Aimee chimes in and says “don’t worry, our men have got this” to which I say back, “ah, no I don’t mind”.
We’d had two cocktails each (all four of us) and it wasn’t a crazy expensive place but not cheap. 

A bit of back and forth happened, Aimee kept insisting it is always the gentlemen who pay, so I said something like, “you do you, I’m happy to split”. 

The guys were saying they would cover but both seemed uncomfortable. They paid, then we all left. Aimee and her boyfriend went back to his, I said good night to his friend and went home alone. Later, Aimee texted saying her man is now contemplating the relationship because he doesn’t want someone who always insists the men pay.

10,1c97wlw,AITA because I want my parents to pay for my wedding?,"I (f/19) am islamically married to my husband (m/27) since june last year. This means we are a married couple in the name of god. My parents always told me they won't give away their only daughter without a wedding. As a child I didn't mind as much. Today I (and my husband) don't see a reason in a big wedding. So I told them. They weren't too happy about it. We don't want a wedding at all since religiously we already married and this is the most important point for both of us. But because of respect to my parents (and his but mainly mine) and because we don't want to have beef with my parents we tried to talk about a small wedding in a mosque. At first they agreed for the wedding to maybe be in a mosque. Now my and his parents decided to rent a big wedding location. They plan to invite about 120 people. For people from my culture this is small but when we said small we meant SMALL (and made that clear)... My husband and I weren't too happy about all of this. However we kind of agreed (again) because of respect and no beef. This whole situation is already crazy and shouldn't be created by my or his parents. But out of love and respect we would have pretended to enjoy our own wedding. Now comes the worst part. Yesterday we went to the location to sign a contract. My father, his father, him and I went and talked to the guy. They laughed and agreed in everything. Our fathers agreed to both pay 50%. I repeat OUR FATHERS said they would both pay 50%. My dad 50 his dad 50. When we were home my parents and I talked. Without even asking they expected from me that I would pay the % my father agreed on paying. I felt immensely disrespected. It's not only that I have to live through a wedding I don't even want. I also have to pay 50%. Of course I didn't agree. My father said if I am not going to pay, there would be no wedding which would mean he wouldn't give away his daughter... mind you he makes his only daughter go through this. I have one younger brother. Alhamdulillah financially we are fine. I always had to hear how my father financially supports our family back home. How he payed for the weddings of my aunts and uncles. He never complained. But now he makes me pay. It's not like I don't have the money. Alhamdulillah I was able to safe some money from when I was working. I am in university right now. Back then my parents never asked for my money. They said I should safe my money for when I need it. For my wedding and everything. They never said I have to pay the whole wedding. They said I have to pay my wedding dresses. They never said I will have to pay for a wedding me and my husband don't even want. They expect me to pay 50% for a wedding I can't even plan because every little suggestion I make is bad in their eyes and mostly gets ignored. I talked with my husband about it. His father will stay true to his words and pay the other 50%.

So aita because I want my parents to pay for my wedding?

edit: it has only been 24h and so much happened. One Information I forgot to mention: Since my parents will not give away their daughter without a wedding I still live with my parents.

Today my father and I went to my husband who currently lives in our home on his own. We went to get some packed stuff of mine to the flat. My husband confronted my father and I asked why I would have to pay for the 50% my father agreed in paying. It kind of didn't work out. My father repeated how he raised me, how I am his daughter and how my money islamically is his. I never ever heard of this and am kind of convinced he lies. Maybe somebody from here knows about it and could clear this up for me. We talked for like 2½ hours and in the middle of it I kind of started to scream at him and cried a little. It's just frustrating to me...

All the talk didn't do anything except for my parents to be mad at me because I talked to my husband about my father's lie. I don't see anything wrong with this. However my parents are extremely mad. They said, I chose my husband over my parents...

I also talked with my father in law on the phone. His words made me strong but I believe this time (as always when I don't agree with my parents) I am the loser. I am going to pay the money and wont ever forgive them. Currently thinking about not talking to them again/ not including them in my life.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,1.0441111,1,0
11,1c97js5,AITA for expecting payment in spite of  friend’s/client’s Grandma’s death?,"I [32M] have a side hustle/hobby of doing yard work for a few clients/friends. I was recently put in contact with a friend of a friend [29F] ( let’s call her Megan) who had some jobs for me. The first couple of transactions went smoothly. 

We became pretty quick friends.

When she first mentioned she was struggling with money and asked for more time to pay for a job I was working on, I didn’t think twice about it. She asked for an extra day or two, but that turned into a few days. 

She eventually paid though. This happened a couple times. She’d have a job, I’d do it knowing that she wouldn’t be able to pay right away, and it would still take her longer to pay than the timeframe we’d agreed on. 

Each time this happened I would feel that she was less talkative, distant. 

Well fast forward to maybe 3 weeks ago, same situation. I’m owed money, it’s a week past the agreed upon payment date, and I’m getting radio silence. 

This was the biggest transaction to date, by a lot. So I’m starting to get a little worried, and say as much when I notice my texts are green. We both have iPhones. I know it doesn’t automatically mean that I’m blocked if my texts are green, but one can imagine how I’d be worried about that at this point.

I give up and kinda write it off when she finally responds with this long story about being in the hospital. She pays me and I feel bad for doubting. 

Then another job where she needs me to work with her in terms of payment, and I do. It takes her longer to pay, but I can’t argue when she asks “when have I never paid you?” —she’s always paid me (but rarely on time). It’s just that her uncle died this time and she can’t believe how not understanding I’m being. 

Then a couple days ago I do another job (I know, regardless of whether I’m an asshole, I’m certainly a dumbass for continuing to do these jobs) and she says she’ll pay the next morning. She doesn’t. Her grandma died and would I please just be nice? 

I told her “sorry to hear that” and she called me out for being insincere. And it was insincere because, frankly, I didn’t believe her. And I’m a pretty trusting, naive person. I couldn’t believe it though. What were the odds that nearly every time she owes money, a loved one dies? And regardless, I don’t see how that affects her ability to pay me. It’s not like she’s paying for the funeral.

But I’m painted as the bad guy here because I told her I still expect to be paid and that she could have paid me in the time it took to call me out.

It turns out her grandma really did die, and I quickly apologized and offered my sincere condolences, etc…should I have needed proof? Idk. 

But again I can’t help but feel this shouldn’t prevent her from paying for services already provided.

I think that she is just trying to buy time or piss me off to where I say something mean enough to where she can justify not paying me in her head.

12,1c97fuk,AITA for saying I’m unavailable after getting volunteered for something?,"My son is on a player pitch baseball team. He’s 10. Coach sent a text last night to all the parents giving assigned dates for parents to run the concession stand and provide a crock pot meal during the season. 

My assigned date was a day I can’t make. For context, I’m a single mom and a nurse who works all sorts of bizarre hours to balance my time with my kids between when they’re with their dad (who lives in the same town and we do 50/50 and are very amicable.)

I initially was surprised to see that I was committed to something that, to me, feels very overwhelming. I work long hours on the days they’re with their dad so I can be home on days they’re with me. I am struggling to stay on top of my day to day life sometimes. I’m burnt out but my kids deserve the chance to have their own hobbies so here we are. 

The idea of having to plan, prep and cook a meal and be managing a concession during a game that is important to me is really upsetting and has been causing me a lot of strife.

I don’t get to go to all of my son’s games - because I work every other weekend in order to keep my commitment and get benefits. I’m lucky if I’ll make half the games. I’m a very present mom and missing games is hard. When I can make the games, I want to be available and engaged. Watching him play and him knowing I’m paying attention is something that’s important to me. 

I love my job, despite the schedule which can be stressful, is also flexible in many other ways that are helpful to me in this stage of life. 

I messaged the coach to basically say that while I care about the team and don’t want to be unsupportive, that I cannot be committed to helping in that way. If other opportunities to help came up and I could help then I would gladly volunteer. He basically told me he would switch the weekend to one I would be at a game so I could help. 

AITA for refusing to commit to this task? I am so torn up about it but ultimately feel like it’s shitty that his coach signed people up to bring a meal and work during the game without discussing it beforehand. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,0.08871881,0,1

FYI, my dad’s retirement party is kind of a big deal in the community he is in. It’s not like a finance guy, but more of a community service lifetime achievement. I know it would mean a lot to him if I went, even though he’s a man of few words, and the party will probably only be a few hours. 

For reference - I live 3 hours from the bachelorette party, and live 5 hours from my dad’s retirement party, so hypothetically if I drove 7 hours to get to the retirement party from the bachelorette party, I’d be driving 5 hours back home the next day, in addition to the 3 hours the first day to get to the bachelorette party. I would also only be able to go to the bachelorette party Friday night, and leave at noon on Saturday at the latest. 

I also already checked flights, and it would be a few hours to get to the nearest airport from the bachelorette party, so that wouldn’t work either. 

I am planning to go to my friend’s bridal shower and wedding (of course). 

So, AITA for skipping out on my friend’s bachelorette party for my dad’s retirement party? 

Edits for typos & clarifications**

UPDATE: Since the bachelorette party starts on a Thursday night, I’m choosing to leave near the mid/middle of the day Saturday, then drive 7 hours for my dads retirement party - let’s do both! Thanks all! ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,0.08532497,0,1
14,1c96tz2,AITA for clearing out my room so my boyfriend can bring his things?,"My boyfriend 24(m) just moved in with me 25(f) about a month ago. I lived alone originally and have a fully furnished and decorated two bedroom townhome. Since he moved in and before when he’d spend the night he’d complain about the things I have, like how he hates my tv, or my shower or the bed, practically everything I own he’s voiced his opinion on. Now that he’s moved in he says he feels that he needs permission from me to bring his things even though I’ve got everything we need to live comfortably. 
We were going to turn the spare room, which I’ve been using as a closet, into a nursery for the baby. We have some items for the baby but we’re far from being ready. I told him the next place we go we can decorate and furnish together to give it our own home feel instead of it just being all my stuff. He said he just wants to feel like he’s got his own space and the ability to bring whatever he wants home. We’ve been arguing about this since he moved. So I’ve taken all the art and few personal items out of our room, where his closet is, and put them in the spare bedroom and said he can do what he wants with the room. 
He says he wants it to be ours but hates all my things and the house but we’re not in the situation to move or buy new things other than for the baby. AITA for moving some things to the other room so he can decorate one room in the house?

15,1c96oc7,WIBTA if i didnt invite them to my birthday dinner?,"So i (19F) am turning 20 in about a week and a bit, and im planning on just having a little dinner with some close friends of mine. But right now im just having a bit of a dilemma about who i want to invite.

So far i am for sure inviting 5 people, but im unsure about the 3 that are one my mind. Basically me and the 3 people were super close  in 1st year, then comes 2nd year and they started to distance themselves from me and 2 other people, and then 3rd year we would talk and say how much we missed each other whenever we would bump into each other, but we never were the same. Its also worth mentioning the way they kinda ghosted me and our other 2 friends was really painful and took a toll on me which i had a drunken breakdown over, and my now closest friends consoled me and urged me to cut them off. 

So why am i even considering inviting them? I am a people pleaser and basically last november one of these 3 had a birthday, in which i was invited to, and looking back i probably shouldnt have gone. A couple months back i still felt some sort of attachment to them since i felt like they were my first friends abroad and i became emotionally attached. Anyway. Then fast forward to 2 weeks ago, i was again invited to another one of the 3’s birthday dinner. So somehow i kinda feel indebted to invite them to mine??? Idk on one hand i feel bad for not wanting to invite them even though they invited me, but then i feel like that would kind of give mixed signals since i did show up to the other birthdays. So would i be the asshole if i didnt invite them?

16,1c96i5s,AITA because I ran out when my sister called me a Sociopath?,"AITA:
My sister insists on calling me a sociopath just because I ask for the attention of our busy mom. 

I (17F) and my older sister (20F) have a complicated yet close relationship. Ever since I was little I’ve had to deal with my own health issues and therefore I’m not around a lot of other people and I don’t go to normal school. 

Our mom is a CEO of a steadily growing IT company. She’s busy all the time and she has been busy for as long as can remember. When I was growing up I was definitely a mamas girl, I would always go to her for all of my problems and despite being busy she’d always give me her attention. When my sister was having trouble she’d also go to our mom but I’d be there too because I never left her side. 

We got into an argument today while I was staying at her apartment. She was drunk and was calling me a sociopath to which I said that’s not true. I told her that I’m not sociopath I just have my own problems and I go to mom for them. She said that I always steal all my mom’s attention and that’s why she’s so closed off with people, that’s why she’s single she says. 

We started screaming at each other and now I’m walking home from her apartment because she won’t drive me.

Everything took a toll on me, after the break up he asked me to help him take care of the dogs (we had gotten together but I couldn't keep because I lived at home so he kept) because he bought a used car and started working with Uber, I loved my babies so l didn't hesitate to help, he would ask for help to pay for rent since I would stay there when he couldn't make it back and I kindly agreed cuz I knew how much he needed help, til one day I received a letter and I decided to take it to him when he was off to his house n I see him come out of his car with a girl, at that moment I left, it hurt me so much to leave my babies behind but it was not okay for me to be mentally put down when all l've ever done was care for the person and went over the top for him, anyways after not speaking for months he contacted me earlier this year to help, he had gotten evicted and wanted to get a trucking license which meant he needed to go to school, he wanted help with watching over one of the dogs, I felt bad to say no and had so many emotions because I missed the dog so much so I agreed, things were okay between us after that until he started saying things again he would constantly criticize me til I had enough, i couldn't keep the dog in my house so I booked a hotel for months while he tried school but ev ally got kicked out for an unfair situation, he has ,ar yet again so I had been lending him my, he has kids so l've been letting him have the room when they visit I'm the one who been paying for food for us to eat and his kids when they are over, and never ask for anything in return, I started running low on money so asked him to least do Uber eats to help me, I been paying my bills and his cell phone and storage and the hotel, recently couple days ago we get into a argument, he started saying I looked down on him ( don't know why since I never really asked for much of him not even to do the dishes) and that I haven't changed and that I gaslight (I tell him he can't use the car because he would say he will go somewhere and then chooses to go somewhere else as well without telling me).

18,1c96dak,AITA for saying that my dad caused my mental issues?,"I've posted about problems with my dad previously, but for some backstory, my dad abandoned me as a baby. I'm unsure of the exact timeline of things, but he got my mother pregnant, left her, got married, she had me, he got divorced at some point, and then my mother was deemed unfit to take care of me by CPS so I was put into foster care. He didn't think he could care for a child, he wanted nothing to do with me. My grandma (his mom) came and got me from foster care. He quickly signed over parental rights so she could adopt me, as did my mom. 

My mom had her fair share of mental issues too, she was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, she dealt with addiction, was in and out of various mental hospitals her whole life, and had bad postpartum depression. I haven't seen her since I was four. Most of what I know about my mom I've learned from my grandma. I don't blame my mom for leaving me as she didn't have much of a choice. My dad has never been diagnosed with anything as he refuses to see a doctor.

My dad has been in my life off and on. I find this to be more damaging than just being completely absent. Up until recently, my dad has seen me once a year for 3-4 days at a time. He lived pretty far away. During that time, he would try to ""parent"" me around.

Added to all this, I went through a string of bad relationships at a young age, many being various forms of abusive. 

On my 16th birthday my dad sent me a letter. It talked about all the issues he went through like he said he had depression, the fact that when I was in foster care he had a job and was in school and didn't think he could take care of a child while still reaching his goal of becoming a lawyer. I just found it to be a bunch of excuses really. My therapist agrees.

As of about a year ago I was diagnosed with several things, being Borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, and c-ptsd. 

The issue came up when I was talking to my grandma and I made the comment that my dad basically caused most if not all of my mental issues (ik bipolar disorder is genetic, I don't count that one). Everything else can all be linked back to being abandoned by him as a child and the repeated trauma that having him in my life has done to me. My grandma of course got very upset at me and said I just blame my dad for everything.

19,1c965pe,AITA for downplaying my collegiate wrestling career?,"(Throwaway) I have been dating my GF for a few years now. When we met sports got brought up early she is a former college Volleyball player so wanted to know if I was also athletic. I told her a played football, wrestling, and ran track in HS. Informed her I then wrestled in college and was decent. I told her I hated wrestling in college and it was just a job to keep my scholarship I asked her not to ask questions about it . ( I placed at nationals a few times) I did not tell her this. She has never brought it up again I thought it was because she respected that I did not want to talk about it. I figured she would just google me if she wanted to know more.

We recently went to visit my mom for the first time she lives across the country now. with out me knowing my mom turned her spare room into a trophy room for me and my siblings. There are four of us so we each get a wall. I was the only wrestler so my wall is full of metals its a little deceiving since I only kept golds growing up I would chuck the other ones away.

She spent a lot of time looking my wall over and asking my mom what some of them were I got embarrassed and went to play with the dog. She seemed normal the rest of the night until we got to the hotel where she was visibly furious.

She laid out that she feels stupid because she always talks about her volleyball days and that she was nowhere near as good as I was in my sport. She also told her brother that I peaked as an athlete in HS. Her family is extremely into spots. I told her I loved how passionate she was about playing volleyball and she loved it so of course she talks about it a lot. Also the brother thing is funny cuz I feel like I did peak in HS sports at least my enjoyment of them. I try to block out college.

She is now saying IATA because I lied to her and now she does not know what else I lied about by omission. I think I told her the truth I was decent.

With that little back story out of the way, my husband has had this one friend for as long as we’ve been together and I have never understood why. He is the most disrespectful, vile, self centered person I have ever met. He absolutely loves getting people worked up for his own entertainment. For some odd reason, my husband has always cared what this friend thinks of him and has a hard time standing up for himself (and me)when it comes to him. 
I recently found out that the two of them went to a strip club. I was very upset. I told my husband how disappointed I was and how badly this hurt my feelings and he was very receptive and apologized for the lapse of judgement. Here’s where I’m at a loss..
Knowing how upset I was about this whole thing, his friend invited my husband back to the strip club and when my husband declined saying not a good idea, he says and I quote “you had better tell your wife that we will be going back to the strip club and we will be getting our d’s s’d” 

I have asked my husband to stop seeing him and to end the friendship but he won’t. They also work together so he is saying that it would affect his work life.

I genuinely loved all of them and enjoyed hanging out with them thinking that they’ll always be my buddies till I grow old.

It all started to crumble when I found out that they were actually planning on a trip, which I wasn’t invited to.

I felt incredibly hurt, even betrayed. I thought that I was 
part of all activities with them. 
I voiced out to them how hurt I was that I wasn’t included in the plans, which one of them responded that of ourse I can go if I want to but I shouldn’t be upset if I’m not always updated on the plans, and was told that overreacted too much and should stop blaming them for my hurting feelings. At this point I was beyond hurt and ended up becoming angry and because I was too overwhelmed with the pain, I lashed out and called them fake friends. One stood me up telling me that the world doesn’t revolve around me and that I was too much of an emotional mess. No matter how much I expressed that I just simple wanted to be included I was just being seen as selfish and self centered. I thought that maybe it’s because I called them fake friends, which I didn’t really mean it, i was just upset that i ended up saying it.

I owned up to my mistake and apologized to them, I even got them apology gifts. They said it’s all good and are glad that I calmed down. Only to find out that they still went through the trip without me. I got hurt again but no longer lashed it out since I didn’t want to do the same mistake. But all I wanted was to be included because I thought I was their friend.
I understand that I can be too emotional when I’m hurt, maybe that’s why they don’t like me and excluded me.

About 20min later BL comes out and tells us that they're leaving, NOW. and insists that SL get her shoes on and go. After that I asked my husband what happend and he told me that BL was making SL diet because he thought I was a bad influence on her since I'm plus size (I'm a big girl just under 300lbs), and I usually eat what I want. Husband said that BL had said that if SL ballooned up like me they were done and husband had responded that he was being cruel and unreasonable and that was when BL stormed out.

25,1c951rw,AITA for asking my MIL to fly home after all of her help?,"Posting anon for a reason.

My husband (early 40’s) suffered a major medical emergency about four months ago. At the time it occurred his mother, my mother-in-law, flew out to our side of the country to help with his care. Early on, her help presence was invaluable. She is a retired ICU nurse, I have no medical background. 

My partner could hardly move and couldn’t speak for weeks. He was in inpatient rehabilitation but now is home. This is where the issues with my MIL became more significant. Previously she wanted to stay in a hotel to not “overstay her welcome” in our home, her words. Since my partner’s release home she has been staying in our guest room, which I initially agreed was good. My husband is still recovering, needs significant assistance, and has many outpatient appointments.

Now out of the hospital she’s began commenting to me that she knew the real reason, since doctors couldn’t give me any reason why it occurred. Then went down an anti-vax conspiracy rabbit hole about how the pandemic was bioterrorism to get us all in to get vaxed. She told me, before she retired, ALL her patients had received it before having the same condition. I told her that’s correlation, not causation. The elderly were both likely to have both, but one isn’t caused by the other. She said even some healthy adults. I said it is still correlation. I wanted to scream, aren’t you a nurse?? I didn’t. 

I also learned she’s been putting essential oils on my husband’s affected left side. He was developing a rash but he wasn’t sure why either, and he has trouble remembering anything to do with his left side. Finally saw her applying them and she said they’re for nerve growth. I said he’s clearly developing a rash to them, you need to stop, she said that’s a sign of inflammatory modulators coming to the site to regrow his nerves. Again, I’m no doctor, but the nerves in his arm are find it’s his brain that is damaged. 

This was it for me. I told her that night I was grateful for her help but she should go home now and be with the rest of the family. She was adamant there was still too much here to do. I finally had to tell her, I feel she is now detrimental to my partner’s health and I need her to leave. She opted to go to a hotel, she was in tears, and she left on the earliest flight she could. She has since posted to FaceBook that her son-in-law (myself) has verbally attacked her and barred her from using her 35+ year career as an ICU nurse to help her only son recover. I’ve received actual death threats from his side of the family. I’m shocked. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,0.09940774,0,1

Everyone who didn't come tried and act like it wasn't necessarily a big deal to him and told him that they were sorry that they had to miss it but kinda dismissed it as having other plans and stuff.

My brother didn't really say anything but just kept looking at his phone but I could see his facial expression change.

My dad asked me why and told me that the family was looking forward to seeing me graduate and but I told him that I understand tbut I just didn't want them there. He kept pressuring me on a better reason but I didn't really wanna say it in front of my brother because I didn't wanna make him upset. 

I just told him that I just didn't want them there.

I thought he'd finally understand but he didn't.

 He told me that they didn't choose to move the graduation date and I explained to him that I understand but it still doesn't mean I have to want them there. He didn't like this and basically told my brother about it too. My dad keep trying to convince me to change my mind but I don't think I should have too.

27,1c94mvt,AITA for being annoyed at my fiancé for not making my sister a bridesmaid,"I (30M) have known my fiancé (29F), we’ll call her Amy, for 7 years and we got engaged 3 months ago. I also have a little sister (9F), we’ll call her Lily. Amy and Lily are very close as Lily only has brothers and Amy is an only child. Amy promised Lily before we even got engaged that she could be a bridesmaid for our wedding. Lily has waist length red hair which she is very proud of, and Amy loves it and frequently comments on how gorgeous it is and loves playing with it.

The problem came up last week, when I was at my parents house without Amy one day, and Lily was talking to me and asking when Amy was officially going to ask her to be a bridesmaid as she was really excited to go dress shopping. I said that it’s none of my business as the groom, and she’d just have to wait and see, but I was really happy seeing how excited she was.

I asked Amy later on when she was planning on asking Lily to be her bridesmaid, but she hesitated and then said she’s not going to ask her, and that she’s not going to be a bridesmaid. I was taken aback as she’d always expressed that she wanted Lily so be a part of our wedding party.

For some background, we’re planning on a spring wedding, and Amy very keen on the trend where all the bridesmaids wear a different pastel colour, which are all different but tie together nicely.

I know that the bridal party is completely Amy’s decision, and not mine but I asked her why not all of a sudden. She said that if Lily was a part of the bridal party she would be wearing a pale pink dress, which would clash horribly with her vivid red hair, and she didn’t want that on all the photos. I personally really don’t think it would be that much of a problem, and I know Lily especially would love that dress as it’s her favourite colour. I asked is it not possible for Lily to wear one of the other colours, and for one of the other bridesmaids to wear the light pink. She said she’d already decided what each of the girls were wearing based on what best suited them, and that it just wasn’t possible for Lily to be a bridesmaid. 

I left it at that for the night, as I didn’t want to get in a fight over it then. I’ve so far stayed out of the way of all of the bridal party stuff as it’s completely her choice, but I was shocked by this as Amy has already told Lily that she can be a bridesmaid. I brought it upon again the next morning calmly, and asked her is there no way she could still do it as she was so excited. Amy turned around and almost shouted in my face though and said she’d made her decision and that was final and Lily wasn’t going to be a bridesmaid. 

I told Lily that it turns out that due to a couple of different reasons, she wasn’t going to be able to be a bridesmaid, but didn’t tell her the reason why as I didn’t what her to feel like it was her fault. She didn’t make a big deal out of it and just said okay, but from what I’ve seen of her and from what my parents have told me she’s really upset. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,1.0577763,1,0
28,1c948qt,AITA for telling my wife that her brother relapsed?,"My wife's (Esme) oldest brother (Tom) is an alcoholic. She has a lot of trauma associated with her brother's addiction. Due to his addiction, he caused a car accident when she was 18 which resulted in serious injuries for her including permanent hearing loss. This wasn't something that went unpunished and he did serve prison time. When Tom admitted that he had a problem with alcohol, Esme started to forgive him but she has made a point to never forget and has said that she will go low contact if he relapses. 

Over the years she has gone low contact with Tom twice due to relapses, one of these was when he came out of prison.  Tom now works for the same company I work for but we work in completely separate fields in the company. Tom was fired last week for misconduct after he was found to be drinking on the job. I had heard through the grapevine that this was why he had been fired. I called Tom and asked him outright if this was true. He told me that it was, but begged me not to tell Esme. I told Tom that I wasn't going to lie to Esme and she needed to know that he had another relapse. He was angry that I was going to tell Esme, accusing me of trying to rip apart his family and told me that I was controlling Esme. Since the last time Tom relapsed, we have had children and since our first was born Esme had told me that if Tom relapsed then we would go permanently no contact because she doesn't want to put them at risk.

By the time I had gotten home, Tom had already called his parents and told them that I was spreading lies about him and that I was going to tell Esme that he'd relapsed when he hadn't. Tom is the golden child, they never think he's done wrong and blamed Esme for Tom getting prison time. They had called Esme telling her that I was spreading lies, and trying to damage the family even going as far as to accuse me of abusing Esme. When I stepped into the house, Esme asked me if it was true, if Tom had relapsed, and when I confirmed it was true she just sighed in frustration before messaging her parents and Tom to tell them that she was going no contact with Tom and that she didn't want him near any of us. She has blocked Tom on everything and is currently not responding to any messages from her parents. I've had to block Tom and her parents due to them sending me abusive messages. The three of them have taken to social media, accusing me of trying to split up the family and abusing Esme. I have them blocked on social media but Esme's middle brother send me a screenshot of what they had been posting as a heads up so I could make my employer aware in case Tom made a complaint.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,0.048170738,0,1
29,1c946yt,AITA for not taking my “friend” to prom? ,"  I am a junior in highschool and it’s my first year being able to go to prom without having to be invited. A friend, Jasmine, is a sophomore. We’re pretty chill I would say, so she wants me to take her to prom this year; it’s the only way she’ll be able to go. 
     I have a crush on this guy, Nate, and i’ve known him for 3 years. We’re also pretty good friends, and he’s the same grade as me. Jasmine, Nate and I all were apart of a group event, so Jasmine knows about my crush on Nate. She just got out of a 3 year relationship and has a thing with Nate’s friend (like a situationship). So Jasmine starts calling Nate “cute” or “hot”, but claims she would never do anything bc she knows i like him. 
      Then, Jasmine shows me a text she sent to one of her other friends, and it basically said that Jasmine “wants to hit things off with Nate”. She claims that she was intoxicated, but i don’t understand why she would she would show me that. I don’t know if she showed me to make me mad or to genuinely let me know. she knew i would be upset.

30,1c93ykr,AITA For the Way I Sneeze?,"I (32 year old m) live with my sister (27). I get very bad seasonal allergies, and when I sneeze, my reflex is to cover my nose and mouth with both hands. I feel like this is the default way we were taught to cover as children. Apparently though, by the time my brother and sister were going through elementary school a few years behind me, kids had shifted to being taught to cover with their full forearm and elbow. I’ve seen some people call it the “vampire cough.”

 I do understand the logic behind this (cleaner hands when you touch anything), but I find it hard, in the moment of catching a sneeze, to override my reflex to cover “old style.” I also think that while there probably are some marginal benefits to the vampire cough, and if I’m not gonna do it I should try to wash my hands when I can, people covered my way for a long time and it was considered socially acceptable.

But my sister has a very strong disgust response to it. When she came at me about it in a very harsh tone, and I tried to make the points in my last paragraph, she escalated to full-on screaming at me, saying the girl I’ve been seeing was gonna be disgusted by me etc. I would feel more inclined to at least try to make the switch if she would ask nicely, though it does annoy me that she makes such a big deal out of it.

I (27F) live with my mother (46f) and act as her caretaker because of certain disabilities she has. I had cleaned the entire bottom floor of our house earlier and she cooked dinner. She volunteered to do the dishes and, because I was exhausted and sore from an injury I received a couple of days ago, began going to my room.  She asks where I'm going, I tell her that I'm going to my room and ask why she wanted to know in case she needed me to do something. No big deal, right?

Wrong.

She began slamming stuff around and mouthing off about how I'm leaving her with dinner dishes and she's got too much to do and how SHE apparently cleaned the whole house even though she hasn't been home. So I come back down and offer to take over so she doesn't have to and she slams a Tupperware bowl into the sink and snap that she's got the dishes and to not worry about it. She also claimed that I was apparently giving her nothing but full attitude and how dare I as well as proceeding to mock how I was talking in the most obnoxious manner she could. When I tried to counter that I didn't, she cut me off to shout over me that I apparently always give her this attitude and that she never says anything so we don't fight.

But we have a fight like this at least once a week. And she's allowed to tell me how I'm always wrong and making her life difficult but I can't even tell her that I'm physically injured or she'll go on a full rant about how she's in so much more pain and I have it so much better.

32,1c93w9u,AITA For keeping my kids away from their new uncle?,"
I have been with my wife “L” for 11 years now. We have two kids together, a 2 year old girl and a 6 month old son. My SIL, M, was beyond excited when she found out we were expecting, and wanted to be very involved in our kids lives as the “cool aunt” because she herself believed she would never have children.

Last year, M asked our group of friends, “If you were talking to someone, and they threw up several red flags in their personality, but they treated you nicely, would you continue to pursue that relationship?” We all, of course, said no. Red flags exist for a reason. But then, a week later, she introduces my family to her new boyfriend “R” and his daughter “S”. Before doing so, M made a note to tell me that R was conservative, which i thought was odd. We are all very progressive, and “M” more so than the rest of us, so i thought it was a bit weird but that’s ok. R was quiet throughout the dinner and after that, we didn’t see him for a while, though M continued to be very involved in our lives. 

A few months later, we went on a family vacation and “R” tagged along. On the very first morning, i was sitting in the floor playing with our daughter while a children’s show with a black man as the main character played on the tv. He walked over to M and whispered something to her and she got up and turned off the tv. When i asked why, she said that R didn’t want S (a 7 year old) watching it. Ok, whatever, it was background noise anyway. Then, when she went back to him, i heard him say “-that fucking queer” to her, referring to the main character. I was APPALLED. M is bi so i was astounded that he would say that to her and even more so that she laughed after he did. We parted ways for the day but that night, we all met back up for dinner. I wasn’t feeling well so i left early, but later that night my wife told me that he made several racist comments about the black family seated next to us with my daughter right there at the table. At that point i’d had it. I did not want this person around my kids. 

When the trip was over, i told M that i thought she was making a huge mistake with this guy, that he wasn’t “conservative”, he was homophobic and racist and i don’t want my kids growing up thinking it was ok to hate people because they’re different. She got very upset with me because this meant he wouldn’t be allowed at family holidays if my children were there, and that if i just spent a little more time with him, i would see he wasn’t all that bad. I refused. This caused a massive argument between L and M and now, M said that if R wasn’t allowed around my kids, she wouldn’t be a part of our lives any longer. To make matters worse, she’s now pregnant after believing herself infertile, and her and R are getting married next weekend. Now my wife wants us to go to couples counseling because she’s convinced that i’m overreacting about this. If she wants us to go to counseling, that’s fine with me, but i don’t think that i’ve done anything wrong. AITA ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,1.0060991,1,0
33,1c93w17,AITA for going to college?,"I am the youngest of 4 siblings. I am about to turn 38, my sister is 46, brother 48 and brother 53. I have a different father than them who was my stepdad who raised me until he passed away. My mother and stepdad were married 2 different times. She became pregnant with me when she separated from my stepdad during their first marriage. My sister and I have always had a tumultuous relationship. She admitted when I was in my 20s that she blamed me for her parents divorcing and always had resentment towards me which would explain her behavior towards me. I was overweight as a kid and she would have her friends tell me how fat and ugly I was and lock me out of the house after school for several hours until my mom came home.

 All of my siblings had kids young, have been married and divorced at least twice and stayed in or around the town we grew up in. Nothing at all against this lifestyle I just wanted more for myself. I am the only child to go to college and move away across the country. We grew up really poor so I got a job at 14 and worked to buy own car, clothes, food etc. I had really good grades but didn't have the money to go to a university right away. I went to community college then eventually to University. I took out student loans and had my mother signed a Parent Loan in which I agreed to pay back. My sibling co-signed a loan for my undergraduate degree that I pay on regularly but have not paid off fully yet. We got into an argument previously and they decided they wanted to be released as the co-signer. I have tried to release them as a co-signed but my credit wasn't good enough at the time so I continue to pay the loan every month and will until its paid off. Its around $6,000 currently and I plan to apply to have them removed again next month. I have a good amount of student loans from medical school which I pay on every month.

My mother has Dementia and my brother became POA. 2 years ago, I get a group message from them saying they found out about the loan my mom has in her name and what a horrible person I am basically. My mother, nor any of them, haven't paid 1 cent of any of my loans and never have been expected to. Fast forward to today and the group messages go back out again because the student loan company sent a notice about the loan balance update to my mother. They then again, go on about how I'm so selfish for going to school and how could I have had our mother sign for loans I shouldn't have gone to school basically saying again I did all of this behind  their back and I’m horrible person. They keep asking why I haven't paid off all my student loans yet not understanding you don't pay them off in 1 or 2 years. The loans are all current and I have been paying on them. I just find that no matter what I do or say to them I am always wrong. I work 6-7 days per week and pay all my bills and am trying to pay off the loans as fast as I can. I just feel their behavior is a little unjustified. My friends keep telling me they are jealous of me but idk.

34,1c93m3r,AITA for telling the guy who I hired to mow my lawn that I didn't like the job he did?,"I hired a guy to mow my lawn on Facebook sent him pictures of the lawn and he quoted me 30 bucks and said it would get done that day ""last Saturday"". He later said he couldn't do it until Thursday but no big deal to me. It rained a few times between there so the grass grew a bit. He got there Thursday and said because the grass was now high it would be 50. I didn't want to deal with trying to find another person so I agreed. I didn't get to see it until the next morning because I got home late and what follows will be a verbatim account of our conversation after seeing it.

Me _ Hey I just got home last night and didn't take a look at the lawn but there are long clumps everywhere in the back the house has grass shot on it and there's a few spots you didn't even go over. I'll send you a check for 50 because it's what we agreed on and you did mow it kind of but I'm not happy with it and my fiance is actually mad that I'm still gonna send you the whole 50.

Him _ Unsends message before I can see it then says this. Keep your money.  I don’t want it.  Because normally with grass that high, i won’t even offer to do it.  Couldn’t tell in pic how high it actually was.  Only continued to do it for you because i could tell how much of a pinch you were in after seeing it.  I don’t do garden areas without first being asked.  As for the large clumps in the back? As for the patches that were never even gone over? When grass is that high, the mower has to displace it to keep running. Mulch isn’t an option.  Forcing the side discharge to shoot out clumps of grass. I went over every spot in your yard, twice because of that fact. But when it’s wet and that long, some of those clumps will weigh the tall grass down now allowing blades to cut.  It’s simple stuff really. 

But Know that if you send me a check, it will be torn up upon receiving.

Me _ Hey man I'm not trying to be a dick here you did the work and we agreed on a price so I feel I should still pay you. I appreciate the explanation and didn't want the garden messed with.

Him _ Invoice has been updated.  No further response needed man.  It’s actually a small price for me to pay as i do a lot of work at the lake and work with so many contractors.

For context the lake area he's referring to has a lot of very expensive homes and unless you live on the outskirts like me most people have big money and everyone else works for them somehow. So I think that's why he referenced contractors.

35,1c93kyl,AITA for making my sibling's partner pay for my labor?,"Title says it all. I (19m) had agreed to make my sibling's (20m) partner (22f, let's call her V) a costume for the Renaissance Faire this summer.

I took V shopping for the materials and told her how expensive it would be, and told her that the fabric alone had totaled $190. She seemed fine with it, so I started working.

It's a full-body costume and by the time I was done putting together the pattern and cutting the fabric, I had put 5 hours into it, making it total $340. I then told V that, since she misplaced the cord for my sewing machine, I couldn't work on it until she found it.

Since then, I've moved out into my best friend and her partner's house. Because I have some plans coming up in thr middle of June, I reached out to V to tell her that she owes me that. She said she didn't want anymore done because she didn't realize it would be that much, and I said alright, but I still needed the money by early June. I thought that was the end of it. I was wrong.

She tells my sibling, who calls me to cuss me out. After tolerating for about a minute, I hang up on him. He proceeds to call me 5 more times before I block him. So, he takes to discord (a messaging app) to continue and talk about how I'm overchanging her (I'm not. My original consideration for price was 60 per hour, but I decided to be nice). And guilt me about kicking her out of my dnd group (which I did because she kept overstepping the boundaries of my players, but especially because she kept making sexual comments about my asexual, sex repulsed friend) and talk about how I couldn't even bear listening to people tell me that.

At this point, I'm shaking. I'm scared of my brother to be honest. Once, when he was about 40 lbs/18 kgs heavier than me, he sat on my chest and refused to move. I honestly thought I was going to die, and he wouldnt move when I begged him to.

He insists that V will pay me 180, which doesn't even cover the materials. I block him and go and tell V that I'm not changing my price. She brings back up me booting her from thr dnd game and how I only message her when I want my money, and says she won't pay me for 30 hours since I have nothing to show.

My guess is she misinterpreted 30/hr from 30 dollars per hour to 30 hours (in which case I'd only have charged her 5 an hour).

I'm gonna be honest, I was at my breaking point and told her exactly why she got kicked. Because she made my friends uncomfortable. But that's another conversation.

Am I the asshole here? I think I might be for not just cutting my losses and leaving it be, but I want my money and I can't even return the fabric since it's cut up.

It isn’t until while were in the car, driving to my mom’s house for the graduation party that I was told that I was suppose to make pizza for everyone at the party. I’ve made pizza for my family before. Not because anybody asked me to purely just because I wanted to.

39,1c937s9,WIBTA if I wear a dress to a baby shower that I wore to a family member’s funeral?,"CW: death, mentions of miscarriage

I (26F) lost my aunt a month ago after a short but brutal illness. It’s been a devastating time for our family- my aunt was a formidable, gutsy woman, and it still doesn’t entirely feel real that she’s gone. These past few weeks have been about looking after ourselves and my cousins and uncle (her children and husband) as they go through this period of turmoil.

One of her children, my cousin Michelle (30sF), is pregnant with her first child- she’s the one I feel most sorry for during this time, as she is about five weeks away from giving birth and now her mother will not be there to watch her start this new journey. She’s tough, but she was very close to her mom, and after having a sudden miscarriage of what was supposed to be her first baby last March, she’s had one of the worst years of her life. Still, she wants to celebrate her daughter coming into the world and so her sister and my other aunts have planned a baby shower. It’s tomorrow, and I am currently baking some treats for it.

Thing is, I’ve put on a lot of weight due to the years of pandemic and I’ve been slow to lose it. I’m a little ashamed of my body and the fact that I don’t have many formal clothes to wear right now— money is tight and I have been trying to lose some pounds. For my aunt’s funeral, I bought a simple black dress to wear since nothing else I had that fit would have been modest enough for the Catholic Church (thanks, Jesus!) It’s cute and can easily double as a summer dress so I have been planning to wear it elsewhere at some point. A month later, it is still the only formal outfit I have that would be appropriate for an event like this, but I am so worried about going to my cousin’s baby shower in the dress I wore to her mother’s funeral. I know it’s just a dress and truth be told, I was wearing something over it during the services and did not spend much time with Michelle, so I actually doubt if she noticed what I was wearing back then. But would I be sending a bad message if I did wear it? WIBTA?

Edit: I set my phone down for three hours to finish my brownies and came back to more responses than I thought I'd get– hi, everyone! Thank you for your comments– I'll try to answer as many as I can. And thank you for confirming what I'd already been feeling; I'd rather wear a garbage bag than make my cousin feel worse on a day that's already going to be bittersweet. I will dig in my closet to see what I can pull together and enjoy the day celebrating Michelle and Baby A tomorrow. You all get Reddit gold in my heart 💛

Edit 2: This got more attention than I ever thought it would- thank you for your messages telling me to take several seats, as well as your condolences, I really do appreciate it. Good news! I managed to find a (casual, orange floral patterned, and most importantly not funeral) dress to wear! I’m about to go put it on and head over to the shower. I hope I can help Michelle have a wonderful time today 💕

Edit 3/final edit: Michelle had a beautiful shower- so many people came together to make it happen and Michelle cried a little thanking her late mother for the work she put in before her passing. I had a lot of fun and fit right in in my floral dress. Now we prep and wait for baby to come! Thank you all again 💜",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,0.053415388,0,1

I don’t agree with her doing that and she knew that beforehand too. Since a few days earlier we BOTH were laughing and criticizing people that do it. She expressed its because she’s insecure and I get that and gave her the shpeal that she’s gorgeous and perfect before the photoshop. But then questioned why she would lie to me and she said it was because she knew I’d get upset and didn’t wanna hear it.

Then she mostly wears sweats now. Then she quit her job because Janice comes from a wealthy family and Janice makes a lot of money. My sister stopped working out, and eats tons of sweets now.
       I feel really bad even mentioning this next part. Being a woman, I know that weight is a touchy subject. But my sister gain so much weight since her wedding. Before, she was fit and active like me. My sister gained over two hundred pounds in four years. And Janice is as fit and active as ever. They have a home gym and a pool. 
          I tried to give Janice the benefit of the doubt. But last week the 4 of us were out, and we had to go up some stairs. My heart broke watching my sister got so out of breath and drenched in sweat. Literally tears flowed from my eyes. And Janice was looking at my sister with this bright smile. I asked straight up ""Are enjoying watching my sister suffer ? Have you been fatten up my sister ?"" Janice yelled about how she loves my sister, and how dare I make such an accusation. I wanted yell back but Lily calmed me down.
            Now our family and friends are divided. And most of them are on Janice's side. Now I am questioning if I made a mistake. Maybe I didn't have enough evidence to make that accusation. My wife has been quiet on this issue, and I don't want put her in an awkward position. I am so worried about my sister but maybe I was out of line.

43,1c928ec,AITA for telling a concerned mother to shut up and stop talking?,"I (M29) take care of my younger brother, William (FTM15). He lives with me. I've always taken care of him, from the minute he arrived home, our mam was rather ineffectual.

Will and I have a seriously close relationship, I can read his mind half the time and vice versa. I've always taken care of him exceptionally well, even though there have been difficulties.

Since then, we've lived a pretty bohemian type of life. We've never really stayed in one place too long, we've lived in almost all the counties up north and we've had stints of living down south, even lived in Scotland for a little while. I make most my money from painting commisions, or getting jobs at tattoo parlours, so I'm not really tied down. Will is a bright, sparky, charming lad, he doesn't mind having to start new schools, he's able to draw attention to himself and has gaggles of kids enticed and befriended by mid day.

Lately, he's started a new school.He's made friends with a girl, Jeanie (F15). They're very close, which I was surprised by because she's so different from what his friends are usually like, she's very sheltered and posh. He was invited to come over after school at one point, they were picked up by Jeanie's mum (F early 50s?), even though they're year 10s. She managed to worm out of Will his entire life story, and when I came by to pick him up, Jeanie's mum just started this long conversation with me about raising teenagers, household chores, giving me irrelevant advice - just acting as if I didn't have a clue in the world and Will was this horribly neglected orphan.

Jeanie's mum, Laurie, will still send me patronising WhatsApp messages multiple times a day, even calling me ever so often with her advice. This woman has even tried to get me into more conventional employment, despite me telling her that we are fine as we are, and trying to set me up with women (because how can you raise a child with periods w/o a woman??). It's so ridiculously over the top, this woman has even told me that I can give her our dirty laundry and her cleaning lady will wash and iron it for me.

The final straw was when Laurie came by to collect Jeanie after she spent a day at our house. Laurie was scathing about our home decor (vintage furniture, posters and paintings on the walls). She started giving me advice on how to make our apartment seem less 'cluttered' and more 'appropriate' (by taking down the paintings I have done of backs with scoliosis). She even started lecturing me on what I made the kids for tea (avocado bagels), started explaining to me how to cook food. I've already had a stressful day and I told Laurie to please shut up and stop talking, that we are managing and she's very patronising. It's offended her, and it upset Will because now it's awkward for him when he visits Jeanie.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,-0.0009280571,0,1
44,1c91wy1,AITA for refusing to give up the tickets for Sick New World? ,"I wanted to surprise my husband for Christmas & bought him a VIP wristband for Sick New World in Vegas April 2024. To ensure he got one I talked to his best friend & set it up! I pre registered on the website & waited till the day to purchase the tickets. Keep in mind last year 2023 I also purchased the tickets for everyone since I am at home with a newborn. I put my address since we never have issues with packages getting stolen & I will be home to make sure they are safe. 

Just to make sure we got them I had my home computer, laptop, tablet, & phone ready. I had to purchase 3 tickets. One for my husband, one for his best friend, & one for a guy that the best friend works with. All 3 of them went last year together and had a good time. I believe that Sick New World first year was in 2023. It’s a bunch of rock bands on different stages. Evanescence, Deftones, System of the Down, etc. last year we paid on our credit card & this year the best friend paid on his card. So it wouldn’t ruin the surprise. Since the best friend owed us money for the ticket last year to have his coworker go he told me to call it a wash. I know he was paying my husband in payments since last year and knew the concert this year was more expensive. I did research to make sure we didn’t owe him and we did! Roughly $200. Sent him the money and the receipt. So I payed for my husband ticket & extra to make sure my husband had his own bed in the timeshare house that everyone is staying at this year. 

I paid for my husband to have a boys trip to relax and not have to be on husband or dad duties. He works really hard and never complains but I know he needs a break! I surprised him with a custom made t-shirt from Etsy with all the 2024 bands on it. It was a great Christmas and he was looking forward to the concert. But his best friend decided to tell us he is bringing a girl he met a few weeks ago to Vegas with the boys. Not his gf & not even a girl he has known for months but literally someone he just met. He didn’t even tell my husband her name that is how unimportant she is to him. Now my husband doesn’t want to go because it’s awkward & he doesn’t want to carpool with a stranger. He doesn’t want to be a 3rd wheel or forced to hang out with the other guy who he met once. He wanted to hang out with his best friend that he has known for 20 plus years. I don’t want to give up the tickets until he pays us back in full which is roughly $1000. So I don’t know what is going to happen the concert is at the end of this month. I don’t trust the best friend to give us our money back based on his actions lately. I feel like he used us to go have fun with our money. My husband wants to give him the tickets & he can pay us after but I don’t trust this person anymore.

45,1c91ori,AITA for discouraging my girlfriend from visiting my family? ,"My girlfriend is American while am from turkey. We both live in America, the issue is my girlfriend is a wheel chair user and turkey is not at all accessible especially the area where I live, we don’t even have a elevator where my family lives, it going to be extremely inconvenient for her. I keep on telling her this but she keeps trying to come up with solutions I feel are inconvient for me.

I haven’t seen my family in 5 years, I don’t want to stay in a hotel,  I want to stay in my parents house. I want to visit cousins in their house. It hard to travel in turkey, when some roads don’t have sidewalk and I live in an area where they are a lot of slant road and staircases plus me and family are more accustomed to public transport which from what I know and seen isn’t the best for a person with a disability. I have asked my sister if where we lived have become more developed but from the pics I was sent, the roads are still frustrating.

I have relayed this to my girlfriend multiple times and she still insist on coming. I just want her to understand that if she comes we are not going to be together 24/7 . I am gonna stay in my house, whereas she gonna stay in hotel etc. turkey can be disability friendly country but where I live is more underdeveloped. She trying to say that it disability friend because of some of the things she has seen online but that really not the reality I know of. 

She mad at me because of this and thinks am this bad guy for not encouraging her from coming. Am I being the ass here? Cause people are genuinely making me feel like my way of thinking is not valid.

47,1c91aa2,AITA for giving our houseguests a deadline to move out,"AITA for giving our house guest a deadline?

My wife has an old school friend who is a single mum with a 17yr old son. She used to live in a different state but due to some circumstances had to move to our state. When she moved she barely had anything just a couple of suitcases. We felt bad and offered to let her stay at our place till she was able to get a job and find a place. 

From very early on we started to realise what a mistake this was. We had to hand hold her in everything from buying a car to finding a job and getting her benefits sorted. She also does the absolute bare minimum around the house, and even though she is now working full time makes zero financial contribution to the household. The only groceries she buys are for her and her son (mostly just junk food), never takes the initiative to cook dinner just helps a little once we are already in the kitchen, never buys groceries unless I specifically ask her to buy something while she is out. When she first moved in I said to her once you are working can you please help us out and contribute financially and she was like yeah of course. But nothing. They have now been here for three months. 

The other day my wife got sick of the whole situation and just gave them a deadline of when they had to move out with the excuse her parents were coming to visit. She gave us a whole sob story about being a single mum and how hard things were . We just need them out for our own mental health but I feel so guilty about the whole thing. I know she is gas lighting us but I still feel bad so AITA? 

EDIT 
OMG EVERYONE THANK YOU. Reading everyone’s comments really made me realise I wasn’t imagining it and she was really taking us for a ride. 

Today my wife went to work and I took the kids to the park in the morning to meet a friend. When I got home the house was a mess and they hadn’t cleaned or tidied. Their recycling was sitting there still from two days ago. Then the friend told me that last night she went through the fridge and ate some food out of a container and I asked her what food. When she told me I realised she had eaten my wife’s lunch! My wife works very long hours and is unable to leave work to buy lunch which means she would have nothing to eat! As soon as I registered that I lost my shit at her! I told her I had enough she could have cooked her own dinner and that I was tired and stressed from them living here and I couldn’t take it anymore and they had to leave! 

She’s currently hiding in her room and she spoke to my wife who told her to find an airbnb for tomorrow and be out. I’ll update you all when this is finally over but thank you to everyone who supported me I am a very non confrontational person and those five minutes of me losing it really was hard on me but I’m glad I was able to get it out! I actually felt physically ill afterwards I thought I was going to have a stroke! I feel better now though and am looking forward to having my house back!

48,1c914xk,WIBTA if i tried to get my girlfriend to stop vaping? ,"hi! first time poster here. just wondering if i (18F) would be awful for trying to help my girlfriend (18F) to stop vaping. she picked up the habit when she was around 13-14 years old but managed to quit at around 15 for about a year and now she has started vaping again as her mum decided it would help with her anxiety and panic attacks. 

i completely understand that it’s there to support her mental health and help her anxiety but at the same time i don’t want either of us to worry about any other negative effects it most likely will have on her physical health. i don’t know if i should bring up quitting and if so then how to go about that. i really don’t want to make her think i’m being judgemental or anything because i think people can do whatever they’d like with their lives but its just because i’m so close to her i don’t want her getting more ill. 

i don’t want to have to say things like ‘we can’t be together if you carry on vaping’ even though it’s a bit of a big deal for me but i just don’t know how to navigate this situation. i’m fully aware it’s my personal preference and she can do what she’d like but i just don’t want her to develop an addiction she won’t be able to get rid of.

(sorry for the awful punctuation and bad grammar) 

thanks in advance for all your help!!


EDIT: i’m not actually sure if she sees her vaping as a bad habit for her health or not and i’m not sure how to find out without sounding accusatory and i don’t know if trying to make her see it as a bad thing is forcing her to stop or overriding her wishes at all.

EDIT: just to clarify, i’m not trying to control her life or force her to quit, this is just about recommending/exploring quitting as an option for her as her health is already compromised so the risks are greater. i’m fully aware that it is her own life and she can and will make all the decisions she wants for herself and i won’t stop her doing anything because as i said im not controlling her life and id never want to either <3 ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,1.0584785,1,0
49,1c913wc,AITA for vocalizing how my friends and I feel about one person we do sports with,"I’m 15F and a part of a figure skating club in my area where I train to compete. There’s this girl (let’s call her Linda) who is the same age as me and I’d say she’s a louder person. Linda often shouts over the other conversation and doesn’t really have an inside voice.

 Not only is Linda loud and obnoxious, she’s also just a dick, she isn’t competing and she decides to play her music right when other people who are competing are about to play their own. She cuts people off and is super rude to the coaches (once she begged to have her lesson switched because she didn’t like the coach she was with and made a very rude comment to our stretching instructor about how nobody likes her class) I don’t think she even knows she does this but it’s disrespectful and I’d freak if one of my skaters acted like that.

 Anyways I’ve just recovered from a concussion and I was sensitive to noise at this time. It was like any normal day and Linda was shouting in the changing room while nobody else was talking so there wasn’t anyone to shout over.. I already felt a headache coming and I’m not aloud to skate when I have a headache so I left the changing room and got my skates on in the rink

lots of people on that session were saying “hey (my name) what’s up? And I would just respond with “it’s just too noisy in there” and they’d understand. Eventually Linda came by and asked me what I’m doing outside of the room..

I was agitated asf so all I could get out was “Linda I mean this in the kindest way possible but we’re all talking to our own friend groups and you’re trying to talk to your friend but you’re yelling and I can’t handle it with my concussion!! Do you think you guys can maybe talk in a softer voice?”

Linda and I don’t get along but we don’t not get along, she was extremely pissed. I’m a sensitive person myself so I have a lot of empathy and I don’t like to say things I’d get upset from so I worded it in the nicest way possible. I understand people get loud when they are excited but last week she was talking about her trip to go knows where sucked.. that’s not exciting?!

After the session Linda was crying and she started yelling at me more… “you’re so rude!” “You think you’re the best and greatest” blah blah blah and I was like uh? Ok? Ngl that sob and scream made me want to explode, my head was pounding. Eventually my other friends chimed in (thank the lord) and said “I don’t think (my name) was rude you asked her what’s wrong and she responded?. She’s still loud, some might say louder, but now she’s super defensive, anytime someone is doing something “wrong” she freaks out, says it’s making her uncomfortable and than reports it to the head coach (I was on my phone texting my mom about how my inhaler wasn’t working and she flipped out and made me show her the message to be sure I wasn’t taking pictures of her)

I don’t think I  was rude but I’m biased, lmk if that was out of line, (she’s still rlly annoying but I don’t think she hates me anymore lol)

51,1c90xuo,AITA for leaving home after a mental breakdown? ,"I (19 F) left home about 9 months ago after a mental breakdown. I won’t go into a lot of details about it, but it resulted in me in a different city in a hospital.  For context, I’m an Indigenous person and I was adopted by my mom when I was a few days old. My family is white, while I’m MUCH different with brown skin, black hair, and dark brown eyes. 9 months ago, I got into an argument with my mom after I attended a graduation party for one of my friends. I was talking about his family ( he is also Indigenous ) and a few things that were upsetting to see. No, I wasn’t making them out to be a bad family, or even close to insulting. My first mistake, because as much as I want to paint them out as good people, my mom and step dad are a little racist. Examples? One time we were eating dinner and the news was on, they were talking about an Indigenous University that was going to be built. With a sneer, my mom said and I quote “I’m so sick of hearing about them, they get everything for free”. I remember looking at her with disbelief. They’ve said many things, but that was one that stuck with me.


In all honesty, they probably thought it wasn’t a big deal. Things escalated, I was defending my friend and his family, and in anger I called my step dad white trash. Yes, I am an a**hole for that, but I don’t actually think that way about them. However, they were outraged by that and offended, which made me angry, because I was never able to be offended by anything they said. For example, I was told to not touch heads of “brown kids” because they had lice. She liked to call me Mowgli, as in The Jungle Book. She also told me that I looked homeless with my hair down and threatened to cut it, she actually did one time. 

At one point in the argument, my step dad said “You’re white, you were raised by white people”. I was beyond pissed, I screamed loudly at them. I’m a quiet, shy person and this was most likely the first time they ever heard me get so angry. I told my mom to not say racist stuff in front of me and she said  “No, I don’t have to do that. You’re different.” 

I left afterwards and that led to my hospitalization. When I called them, my mom sounded…annoyed? As if I just inconvenienced them with my “tantrum” and after that, I left the hospital on my own and came back to pack all my stuff, then I left. My mom did text with the usual “I gave you everything” messages. I told her my feelings and how I felt through text messages. She called me an ungrateful b**** and said she wished she never adopted me. 

I did tell her, the day I left, that she wasn’t even my real mom. It was out of anger, I haven’t said anything like that since I was a little kid. I can understand that I was the a**hole with that comment, but I never did know what I did to get such a reaction out of her. My older siblings have done far worse than having a mental breakdown, but that was all it took for my mom to tell me to leave.

52,1c90xme,AITA for no longer attending family events?,"I, a 27 year old woman, am constantly being berated by my family members, to come and see them when they hold family gatherings. They continue to try and pressure me into joining even when I refuse. 

Now, I like to classify my relatives as one big heaping pile of shit. All my life and even now whenever I do see them, they like to comment on my appearance, my hobbies, and everything in between. They taught me from a very young age, that saying ‘no’ was wrong, and refusing people was very rude and selfish, which I deem absolute bullshit, but little me wanted to see the best in them so I believed it. Because of this certain lesson, I’ve grown up to be someone who always has a hard time saying no and have to constantly remind myself that I won’t get in trouble anymore for keeping my boundaries solid. 

Recently, I moved to Texas; since then, I’ve gotten so many texts asking if I will be coming down to see them soon in Indiana (as if I don’t live thousands of miles away now). Sometimes I’ll let the texts sit there for a couple days before responding, and I always say no; even then, I am always met with a negative response from relatives, my mom especially, calling me selfish and an asshole. Guilt tripping is huge in the family too; my grandma said she’d cry herself to sleep every night if I ever moved away (yet I did anyway). Now she threatens that she will cry herself to sleep every night until I come back. My mother loves to remind me that she put a roof over my head and kept me alive and that I at least owe her and the family my company. I like to tell her that she CHOSE that for herself, but I never win with that either; I only get further insulted. 

Since age 5-6 till now, they have constantly tried to shape and mold me into the person they BELIEVE I should be, with no regard for my own interests and passions. They tried to force Christianity on me and low and behold, I am now an Atheist. Whenever I went to a relatives house when I was younger and said I was an Atheist when I was forced to pray for whatever reason, I would always be hit with the: “Not in this house you’re not”.
Somehow, anything I did was always wrong. If I was reading, I’d be yelled at to go outside. If I went outside, I’d be yelled at to come inside because I’d been gone too long (their idea of too long being 2 hours). They’d tell me I need more ‘girly’ hobbies, whatever those are. 

These past few days she has been calling me nonstop, since there is a family event coming up soon; my cousins from D.C. are going to Indiana and she thinks that means I should too. If they’re coming from another state, I should too. If I don’t, she keeps telling me I don’t really care about them and she’s super disappointed in who I turned out to be. 

I feel bad, yet, I know I’m probably doing the best thing for my own sanity by refusing. 

Am I the asshole like my mom/family says?

We have had to be running some tests at the hospital to check for a condition, everything is being coordinated by the neurooncologist. She referred us to an orthopedist, who then asked for a blood test, additional to other blood tests that were being done to him as requested by the neurooncologist. When we mention to the neurooncologist the order for the blood test from the orthopedist, she took the original and said that, since they had to take my son's vein in order to sedate him for an MRI, they could use that to already take the blood for the test that the orthopedist asked for. Up to here, all is well, except for the fact that taking the vein for my son was particularly difficult, he was resisting and it was especially hard to handle for him (and for us as parents as well). Fast forward about a week and I call the neurooncologist on the phone to see if the results from the test had come in, in order to make the appointment with the orthopedist already. To this she answers that now she remembers that she took the order, but lost it, so the test wasn't made. Then she tries to tell me that I also didn't remind her of the fact this test had to be done (to which I replied that it is not my job to keep track of the tests that are being done to him, assuming everything is coordinated by her and trusting she keeps everything on file). My wife then is overhearing this conversation, which makes her extremely angry, and keeps asking me to let her take the phone, so she can speak to the neurooncologist. I refused to let her take over the call because I was a) already taking care of it in the way I considered it should be handled and b) It seemed to me my wife wanted to go nuclear in telling the neurooncologist how big of a fuckup this was, how incompetent she is, etc, etc. I honestly believe that her talking to the neurooncologist would have done nothing to improve the situation, other than maybe bringing her some outlet to vent her anger. It's been about a week since this happened and we just had a fight about it, because we not only disagree on how things were handled on our end, but my wife feels I betrayed her as a partner and co-parent.

So AITA for not letting her talk to the neurooncologist? If I am, and I am missing something, I will not hesitate to apologize. But I honestly can't see that what I did was wrong.

If I see them outside I circle blocks until they leave and i try to come home late at night. The idea of them knowing I live there is devastating as I’ve gone great lengths to be unreachable. The only thing keeping me going is that my lease ends in 6 months.

 I told my bf how this situation is affecting me and he said I was being dramatic and didn’t know why I felt so strongly about this situation. He said I should have a fuck it attitude and not care if they see me or find out I live there. He said it made him feel uneasy that I was paying so much attention to their house. He then said “imagine how this makes me feel”. 

I got SO mad and we got into a huge fight and I ended up yelling and telling him that I don’t care how he feels, that in this situation his feelings don’t matter and he should be supporting ME thru this as its my mental health that is being affected and my feelings are above his right now. 
This was last night, now I’m reflecting, what i said was super selfish because his feelings DO matter and are important and he’s right this new development has been consuming my life/emotions and I’m starting to feel guilty about what I said and fighting with him over this because no one is above anyone here.

56,1c901ph,AITA for not unlocking the door for my roommate? ,"So my (28F) roommate (26F) lost her keys a month ago. Going on 2 months now. She still has not found her keys or went to get a new copy of the keys. We share a 2 bedroom house. At first I was willing to help her out. I would even get up in the middle of the night, late hours and unlock the door for her. Things happen, things get lost. And I didn’t want her to be locked out. However, I thought that was going to be very temporary and was expecting her to obviously get new keys.

Yesterday she texted me and said she’s about to be home so can I unlock the door for her. I had plans to go to dinner w/ my friends. I told her I can wait for a little then I had to be somewhere. She said okay she’ll be there soon. I waited half an hour. And texted her and asked how much longer will she be. She didn’t answer. So I left. And locked the door. The area we live in isn’t the best. People’s cars have gotten broken into, packages get stolen etc. So I wasn’t going to risk and leave the door unlocked especially since she didn’t tell me how much longer she’ll be. 

Fast forward to like another half hour later. She texts/calls me, blowing up my phone. Mad at me for not waiting for her to get back. I told her she’s the one who lost her keys. And I can’t be responsible for making sure she gets in or not anymore. We’re both adults. I have my own plans and things I have to do. She then asks me to come back. In the past I always had. But I’m fed up and said no. She gets mad at me again and thinks I’m this evil and inconsiderate person for leaving her locked out. With no place to go after she told me she was on her way. 

I genuinely feel like that’s not my problem and shouldn’t have been put on me to begin w/. It’s inconsiderate of her to expect that of me. She really expected me tp wait an hour for her to get home. No. 

She ends up breaking the A/C and window in our downstairs. The A/C that I bought and screwed and bolted in the window btw. I told her she needs to pay for it or replace it. She blames me and said if I would’ve waited none of that would’ve happened. We have mutual friends and they all are siding w/ her and saying it wasn’t that big of a deal and I could’ve just stayed and push back dinner. Or just left the door unlocked.

You have to go with me” and I said that I’d think about it and that it depends on my homework load and what my parents say, but that my brother would probably be there. 

Anyways, flash forward to a few hours later, my stepmom and dad tell me that she asked where I was. (They took my brother to the thing and Rose tracked him down and then asked him and my stepmom/dad where I was) Anyways, Rose texted me and was like “I saw your brother and stepmom and dad, we had sooo much fun. I hope you had fun sitting in your room” (she edited it to add the last sentence). I replied saying how I would have gone but my mom didn’t want me to because I had homework (which is true, I’m failing half my classes and my mom really wants me to get that up.

Later on Rose replied and was being rude and acting like I was a liar. She was implying that I was fabricating a story.

59,1c8zbr6,AITA for not getting my wife some water?,"okay, this is a totally minor issue and not something that anyone will die from, but I want other opinions. 

I am a stander. I do not enjoy sitting for long periods of time, probably because I am tall. I have a standing desk, I mostly watch TV standing around the living room, that sort of thing.

As a result, I am the ""default thing-doer"" of my home. My wife is usually sitting on the couch in the evening and my cat is a lazy sack of crap, so if there's a weird noise or the cat wants out or my wife wants something, I'm ""already standing"", so it becomes my task.

This has been eating at me a little bit, so I have talked to my wife about it. I think she kind of gets me ""intellectually"", but in the moment, when the cat wants out right that second, her *I am sitting right now* brain takes over and it falls to me.

Anyway, you can see where this is going: last night, she wanted a refill on her water bottle, and I made a face when she asked me, so she did one of those UGH groans and stood up and did it herself. And now I'm in a tiny bit of doghouse this afternoon.

60,1c8z87h,AITA the for not wanting to wear the dress my mom wants me to for my confirmation,"I (13F) had a recent argument with my mom (48F) about what I'm wearing for my confirmation. I am getting confirmed as a catholic on the 28 of April so me and my mother are looking for something I can wear to the ceremony. It was required that I had to wear a white outfit yet my mother says I have to wear a dress which I'm not sure I believe. I often wear things more on the tomboy side since I have some insecurities about my body but since it was only a day, I just went with it. My mother had a dress she wanted me to wear even though I wanted a different one and she really wanted me to wear it because it was more church like. The dress was indeed more churchy and I understood where she comes from but there was only one problem I had with it.

The dress had an open chest that showed some of 'the girls' which I was very uncomfortable with. I asked if I could wear the one I wanted to but my mom got mad and me and said things like ""Fine make your own choices now"", ""'You can pay for your clothes and I'll take your debit away"". I didn't want to get yelled at for not talking and didn't want to yell back so I just nod and say okay. Apparently it registered as attitude to my mom and for the next 3 days she barely said a word to me.

We're on good terms as of now but I'm still wondering if I'm in the wrong for this. It's my confirmation so shouldn't I be the one choosing what I want to wear? Another thing about my mom is that she's a little strict and protective. I'll do my best to keep it short but basically all my life she doesn't really allow me to make my own choices, mainly when it comes to going out with friends. She doesn't really allow me to go to anyone's house unless it's with someone she's related to and when I ask when I'll be allowed to do this, she says until I'm 18, an adult.

His immune system is weak and he recently got a nasty bug. He was really sick for about 8 days there, and I did my best to take care of him. Making chicken soup, running to the store to get more Theraflu, ordering and taking out all the other meals he asked for, keeping track of how many hours it had been since his last medication. The night times were the worst. He couldn’t breathe while lying down and would get the chills so I would have to cuddle him really close to warm him and keep adjusting his pillows. I also slept with no pillow so he could be propped up to the maximum height. I’m not saying I’m a perfect nurse because I’m definitely not. One night when I got up to mix his Theraflu at 3:44am, I didn’t mix it very well and he choked on the powder at the bottom of the cup. He definitely let me know how badly I messed up that time.

63,1c8ypzm,AITA for refusing to visit my grandma?,"My (17F) grandma is extremely clingy and attention seeking. Like I’m not even kidding. Every holiday she wants us over from 7am till 5pm and my dad of course has to agree. She lives 4 hours away so we dread it every year. Just to name a few she always has us come over for Christmas, new years, her birthday, mother’s day and hell even my dad’s birthday sometimes. My siblings and I have grown sick of her & our cousins don’t even come at all now. They don’t even call.


This year we skipped her birthday which was two days ago. The problem with her is she also comes over to our house almost weekly (and ofc stays from 8am till 6pm). And every day she calls my dad and my dad forces me to talk to her because she asks for me. He has even woken me up to talk to her. It’s become so annoying. She also starts complaining about some pain every week, visits a doctor or even goes to the hospital and we pay for what she needs and she is always told she is completely fine. This has been a regular thing.

Now when we (excluding dad) didn’t show up to her birthday she claimed she felt ill and had to go to the hospital. She was fine. She is now staying in bed with dad taking days off work to take care of her even though he admitted she was fine but doesn’t want to be alone (my uncle literally lives with her and takes care of her). She asked him to bring me to her so I can see her. My siblings both laughed and called me unlucky. My mom had told me grandma was fine as usual. I refused on the call and said I don’t plan to visit her and she has enough company and hung up. Dad has now called me like 50 times and told me he will no longer talk to me if I don’t come.

64,1c8ynd0,AITA For making a comparison when my classmate was rude to my beliefs?,"English is not my first language, apologies for any errors. My classmate, L, and I are doing a class project, which is equivalent to 90% of the final grade, it is an extensive project, full of regulations and so on, almost like a thesis but without the same academic value, we divide the work, but I think she regretted it, since although I took most of the extensive points hers involved more laws and intense research. My teacher has been keeping an eye on us, because it turns out that she was doing the AI parts of her that put us at risk. In my religion there is a day of rest, in which you cannot do anything work or academic, that day is to rest, eat delicious things and go to reconnect with nature or do some activity that makes us feel relaxed, it is like If there was a bubble during the week where there are no problems and you just have to rest because you are too valuable to burn out.

I had already done my part of the work, I sent it almost 4 days in advance, the only thing missing was L, just that day of rest I felt too overwhelmed by what had happened during the week, so I turned off all my electronic devices and went with a person of the same faith to relax, it is usual that when something overwhelms us we look for each other to console ourselves and remind us how valuable we are, so we went to eat and in general we had a pleasant day that made me forget the problems, but When I got home I found hundreds of messages from L in a panic because he didn't know what else to do, he wasn't able to investigate properly and it had to be delivered. As a result, when I did not respond, she said that it was up to me to do that part, because it was something that absolutely had to be resolved as soon as possible.

Wrote to him that she couldn't do it, because she was still on day off, to which she said, rudely, that she wasn't asking me for anything bad, just to do what we were supposed to do in the project. I tried to solve the problem as best as possible without ruining my day, but she kept writing, trying to get me to do  part. I got tired when she again dismissed my beliefs and I told her, in the same tone, that I was busy and should stop. to write to me, as a result he said that he would tell the teacher that I would be in charge of the legal part of the project, I got angry and said to him ""How would you feel if you were at a Måneskin concert and Damiano was just singing and they didn't stop get annoying messages ruining something that should be special for you?""

65,1c8ygxw,"AITA for thinking l shouldn’t pay for a canceled plane ticket, even if I’m getting the free credits?","Back in October 2023 my best friend casually texted me asking if I’d be interested in going to Cancun with her, her sister, and her brother-in-law in May ‘24. I said yes, assuming we’d discuss details (hotels, flights, etc.) soon after. A few days later, she shared a screenshot of a resort reservation totaling $3k, with my portion amounting to $1.5k. It 3k per room and we’d be sharing one and her sister & BIL would be in another. It's crucial to note that at this point, no actual booking had been made; rather, she had merely held the dates (without consulting me).

In November ‘23 she messaged me that her sister booked the flights, asking if we should get insurance on them. I texted YES, verbatim “get the insurance” and was told in person we had the insurance, and told this for months after. 

Long story short my brother is engaged and his wedding is scheduled for the dates I was supposed to go to Cancun. This happened in January ‘24. I explained to her that I couldn’t go, but it wasn’t a big upset because the resort was never actually booked, but rather the dates were “held”, and then flights had insurance on them. 

BUT in April of ‘24, she told me she found out her sister NEVER actually got the flight insurance, and when they canceled my ticket they got flight credits. But since the ticket information was in my name, I’m the only one who can use the credits, and they can’t be transferred. Her sister now wants me to pay $450 for a flight I was told over the span of 5 months were insured when it wasn’t. I called the airline but was told there’s nothing that can be done due to their policy. She ended up getting another person to take my spot but still wants me to pay the $450 for their loss on the flight because in the end the person going in my place bought a new plane ticket, and I’m basically getting airline credits in my name free. I refuse to pay because I told her to get the insurance.

When I told them that I had invited my boyfriend instead because of this, they went ballistic. Mom accused me of not inviting them because of my sister, which is far from the truth.

67,1c8xyp6,AITA for asking my husband to stop smoking? ,"I 25 F am married to 24 M. We have a 7 month old baby boy. Around 2023 my husband asked me to hold him accountable to stop smoking weed to get a better job since his job pays so little. At this time I was working making almost double what he made. After months of working with him he finally got clean. 2 months later when his birthday rolled around, he asked for one birthday blunt. And I agreed as long as it was just once. Then he went and bought a bag. And said I’ll just smoke until it’s finished. And then kept buying bags and it became “I’ll stop at the end of the month” and then it became “when we move” and then “when it’s closer to the baby being born” and it’s been 7 months since the baby. And I finally stopped it and we came to a compromise. Because I ask my husband if I could stop working and be a mom for 6 months and spend that time with the baby. He agreed. Before we came to a compromise my husband was spending over $400 a week on weed.  But with me not working we couldn’t afford that, but my husband doesn’t have self control so we agreed to a pickup once every 2 weeks and no more than $50 a week on etc stuff (like wraps etc etc)…. Now most recently since my baby turned 6 months old I’ve been back looking for a good job. And I’ve had 4 interviews so far with no luck. I spoke to some family about the struggle and they offered me and him both to move there and rent a nice house and get on with the company they work at making really good money. And between both of us working there, we would have plenty of money and can start building savings for our son and buying a house. 

The condition for this is he would have to pass a drug test. The move is set for a month and 2 weeks from now and my husband is still smoking weed. And when he got his “final pick up” a few days later went and got more. Which in turn started a fight because he’s suppose to be getting clean. 
So the next day I  told him in a month I’m moving with or without him, and maybe we just want 2 different  things in life and if this isn’t what he wants to better our life then I just want a divorce. He apologized and agreed to get clean before the move to pass the drug test. 

Am I the asshole? 

I would also like to add I am not a smoker 
And the move he said he really wanted to go for the better opportunities that our small town doesn’t offer and it’s a big city that we are moving to. 
And we discussed the pros and cons of moving and both agreed it was best for our future. 

Also when we first met he only smoked a few joints here and there, and when we got married he wasn’t smoking. It got out of hand when I started making a good bit of money and less worry on bills. At the worst of it he was chain smoking blunts. But if I said anything about it, it started fights. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,0.0015600764,0,1

Since July 2023 she has started working a full time job and she got a boyfriend. She lives out of state with her mom and stepdad but before July 2023 she used to visit every spring break,every Christmas,and every thanksgiving. Since she got a job and a boyfriend she doesn’t like to visit anymore which is understandable. I worked a full time job from September to February and it was hard to take time off without getting in trouble. I also understand junior year is a stressful school year. 

She was supposed to come for my graduation on May 30th but she says that day is the day she takes her finals for all of her classes. I’ve personally never had finals for all of my classes on the same day but I didn’t ask her anything about it. If she has finals that day she needs to put school first. She recently told my stepdad that she wants to see me and my older stepsister (my older stepsister used to live with her mom and stepdad also with my stepsister but she moved in our state to go to college). However she doesn’t want to come see us she wants us to come see her.

My stepdad plans to visit her sometime in May and wants me and my older stepsister to come with him. However I honestly don’t want to go. I love my younger stepsister but I also have my priorities.

I really don’t want to spend my birthday weekend in a car when I could be having fun at home with friends.

I suggested to my stepdad that I didn’t want to go see my stepsister because I wanted to save at least 1000 dollars before I get to college and the only way I can do that is if I’m working consistently.

72,1c8xgvw,AITA For not apologising to my friends for walking off? ,"I (15F) had to pick up my brother (10M) from his school after I finished school. I told my friends thid and they went with me. I was with 4 of my other friends. 

When we were walking, 3 of my friends were walking really slow so i just walked off and one of my friends caught up with me so we went together. I'll call that friend Amy. So me and Amy went to get my brother from school together while the other 3 were way behind us. 

After I got my brother they caught up and got mad at me and Amy for ""speeding off"". Amys best friend (I'll call her Rebecca) asked Amy why we walked off. Amy told her that she didnt want to leave me out. Rebecca made it seem like she was mad at Amy so me and Amy walked off with my brother. Me, Amy and my brother finally got to my house and one of our other friends (I'll call her Mila) texted me and asked if we were at my house. I said no bc I was about to leave agian ti drop my brother of at my grandmas. 

I didn't know that Rebecca, Mila and our other friend were on my street so me, Amy and my brother just walked off to my grandmas. We didnt say anything to Mila or Rebecca and just left. Me and Amy thought that Rebecca was mad at us but apparently they werent. They thought we were mad at them but we also wasnt. 

Today Amy apologised to them for walking off and tolf me to do so too. I didnt think i was in the wrong so im not going to apologise for walking off. I did apologise for lying and saying we werent at my house when we were but thats all im willing to apologise for.

73,1c8wv47,AITA for not wanting to use my car to go to gf’s parent’s?,"This is probably the silliest AITA, but it’s been bothering me. 

I (26m) ended up getting a nicer used car about 15 months ago, because my gf (25f) accidentally totaled mine when I let her borrow it to go to work while hers was in the shop. She’s had her car since 2017, and paid it off probably 4 years ago with the help of her father and grandmother. I’ll be paying on mine for 5 more years. 

We usually try to take turns with whose car we take when it comes to traveling longer distances. When I bought mine it had 33k on it, and now has around 50k in just 15 months, because I’m the one that usually drives us around town all  the time. Hers has about 120k on it since 2017, because she went to school out of state and her current job is 1 hour away (we tried to look closer to her work to live, but everything was too expensive). 

Her Dad lives about an hour away from us, and we’ll try and take turns on whose car we take there too, but we always take mine to my family’s since the furthest away is 30 minutes. I drove my car to her Dad’s for Easter, and we’re going to her Dad’s today and I was hoping she’d drive. She told me she wanted me to drive, and I said I could drive her car if it was a matter of her not feeling like driving.  She got upset at me, and I said I have put 20k on my car since I got it which wasn’t good, and she snipped back at me and said she’s put 20k on her car in just 4 months because of work.  just dropped it, and she walked away. 

As we were leaving, I started getting anxiety and wanted to just let it go so I told her to just get in my car, but she refused and got angry and got in her car. So AITA?

74,1c8wrpx,AITA For inviting my grandma to my graduation party?,"I recently graduated college, and my parents want to plan a get together. All of my family is invited, and the invitation is public on my social media for them to see. 

Here’s the issue: 

My mother is a narcissist and so is my dad’s mother. My mother can’t stand to be around that woman for more than a few minutes without muttering to me about nonsense that she’s doing that pisses her off. My dad wants his mom to be more included in our family. She hasn’t been in our lives for a good majority of it (gone 18 here 3)

My maternal grandmother, messages me asking why I didn’t invite my dad’s mother. Confused I ask her who said she wasn’t invited? My mother. 

I message my mom and ask her what’s going on. She says she assumed I didn’t want her there. I say no it’s fine she can come I’m not going to get guilted about this. My mother goes off about how I better defend her if she says or does anything and how she isn’t afraid to make her go home. I agreed and told her it’s her house and she can choose who is in it, but I don’t want my dad to be bitter because we left her out of another thing.

I don’t love my grandmother but I don’t hate her either. I don’t love that she wants to insert herself in my family and invite herself to my parents house, which she knows pisses off my mom. My parents have even gone to therapy about all of this drama. I don’t want to be the cause of a fight but I don’t want to make either of my parents upset. 

TLDR: Mom hates grandma and doesn’t want her at my party, I’m trying to keep the peace and just let her come. AITA?

We recently got a new person, The Whistler, in our department through the process of cross training. When The Whistler first entered the department, he began whistling to the music and at first it wasn't bad. After a few days it got annoying, but seeing that it bothered one of the most annoying coworkers that always complained was worth hearing the whistling since it bothered the other coworker so much more. It's been three weeks and I am at my wits end. He is whistling to every. Single. Song. Even if The Whistler doesn't know the song, he will listen for a bit to get the beat or will whistle to the chorus of the song. 

My supervisor has made comments about the whistling while we work but we believe he either doesn't hear him, thinks that we're joking about the comments, or is just doing it on purpose. I finally broke and told him to shut the fuck up and stop whistling. It kind of got quiet for a little bit, just the music going and machines working. I agree I probably should have been more professional about it all, especially since the guy won't be in our department much longer and I'm asking other coworkers what they think and if I went too far or not.

77,1c8w08f,AITA for not wanting to go to my uncle's house because of an exam?,"Hello. I'm a teenager in my mid teens and my parents are both in their fifties. 

Yesterday my uncle invited us over for dinner. Anyways, I had an exam today which I had to study for and the amount of subjects I had to memorize were a lot, so I wanted to stay home. 

I wanted to make an excuse by saying I had an stomach ache, which they caught on too quickly and asked me to come out. 

I kept delaying it, hoping that they would just leave me alone. I didn't want to admit the reason I was staying as they would be mad at me for that (as I had a lot of time to study before).

my father began shouting at me and threatening me and wanted to beat me, but I prevented that by locking the door on my side. He spitefully said that he would embarrass me in front of my uncle and his wife and would ruin my reputation and locked the door on me, which my mother opened. 

My mother begged me to come with them, cursing herself for giving birth to me. She said whenever I didn't attend people always nagged her for my absence, and told me to come if I loved her. I cried and told them to leave me alone and let me make my own choices. 

They told me that why could not I be normal since I was 'healthy'? I have a brother diagnosed with autism and he bothers and burdens them a lot, so they have a lot on their plate because of him. 

I admitted I had to study, and that it was only them who would be angry or upset if I got a bad grade. My mother said that they would let me study in a room at my uncle's house, but I could not really focus there.

I kept crying and said that I hated my family, and I didn't mean them, rather I was targeting those who couldn't mind their own business, but they took it personally. They eventually left without me.

They have given birth to me among all the chaos with my brother, as my brother always caused them trouble, I always tried to fulfill the role of a perfect child they always wanted and not cause them any trouble, but I didn't really succeed. I know as their child I have to listen to them. My parents are wonderful people and always tried to provide the best life for me.

We haven't spoken a word to each other for a day. my mother glares at me now and then and keeps talking behind my back to others. I wanna apologise, but I'm scared.

We had talked about her possibly coming out sometime during april-may. 

A couple weeks later, my sister and mom called me and said they scheduled my mom's flight for April 16th without talking with me if that'd work and expected me to take a day off to spend time with our mom. I moved heaven and earth for them, I worked with my work (on short notice) to get the day off, rescheduled a tattoo appointment  and made it work. Then a few days before the 16th, on my day off both of them woke me up in a group video call saying that mom was sick and that they had to reschedule her trip and they already did for the 21st. They expected for me to move everything again and get off the day of work. 

I told them no, yall didn't talk to me about everything pertaining to this trip. It's such short notice I'm not going to do that to myself nor my boss. During that call my sister had the nerve to ask me if I could take my nephew for the day cuz he was hyper and she didn't want to deal with him. Again I said no, I have things I have to do.

79,1c8u8mi,AITAH for not supporting my sister’s engagement? ,"I (24 F) am planning my wedding to my partner of almost 6 years. We got engaged at the end of November 2023 and we set our wedding date for September 2024! Before we get into the current situation I want to provide a little context. When we were growing up it was always abundantly clear that my sister (20 F) was the family favorite. She was always given special privileges and talked more highly of than me. For this reason, we didn’t get along during our childhood and most of our teenage years. 

After attending therapy as an adult, I came to understand that I couldn’t hold my parents treatment towards her against her because she was a child and the only people to blame are my parents. After working through that, her and I became really close. For the past few years we have been inseparable. She’s my best friend and I am hers. I asked her to be my MOH and she was so excited!

She started dating her current BF (21 M) in late October of 2023. Of course, he just so happens to be everything my family has ever dreamed of in a son-in-law. The exact opposite of my partner. The past 6 months they have been together my sister’s partner is all my family talks about, even at my bridal appointments. Right after my engagement my sister said that when she found out about my upcoming engagement she made it clear to her BF that this year was about me so she didn’t want him to bring up anything marriage related until after my wedding. She said she wanted this to be my year.

I’ve dreamed of this wedding my entire life and maybe it’s selfish to say but I just wanted this one thing to actually be about me. 

This leads us to the current situation. Last night my sister (20 F) and her boyfriend of 6 months (21 M) FaceTimed me together and told me that they decided to get married. They said that he would go to ask my parents either today or tomorrow for permission and then he would immediately go buy a ring. They then said that they want me to help plan the official proposal which will happen in 2-3 weeks with the wedding set for November 2024. I told them that I needed time to process and I ended the FaceTime.

 An hour later, my sister called me to talk about it and I was sobbing. I explained to her how badly it hurt me that she of all people would do this after she promised that she would let this be my year. I explained to her that I want to be happy for her but I am grieving the loss of my special day because the second our family hears about their engagement it will be as if I and my wedding doesn’t exist. She cried while I explained myself and then said “don’t worry about it. Just don’t worry about it. I have to go.” And hung up the phone. I haven’t heard from her since. Right now I feel like I have lost my wedding and my best friend. I am the villain in her story for ruining her moment and she is the villain in my story for taking this milestone from me even after she promised she wouldn’t.

80,1c8u5ab,AITA for not helping my boyfriend financially?,"Hi. I am extremely confused about this and had been debating for days whether to post it here. I am 32 F and my boyfriend is 31 M. I work in finance and make pretty good money. I live alone in my house that I own, drive a 2 year old car, and takes multiple vacations and trips every year. I have been dating my bf for about 5 months now and it's casual. I have told him I am not looking for any long term relationship. 

My bf is divorced with 3 kids. They live with their mom full time cause he has no house. I have never met them and intend to keep it that way. Though he has a decent job, the kids' mom won't or can't work and major chunk of his salary goes to alimony and child support. He shares a rented apartment with a friend. 

When we started dating, I knew he had way less money to spend. I just liked his company so I paid for the dates. Lately though he has been getting on my case about how much I spend. I normally just laugh off the comments cause I know he is straining financially.  But last week when I invited him over a trip to Europe this summer, just for two weeks and he got mad at me. He went on a rant about how I never even offer him to move in or loan him money to get his life on track. I was taken aback and told him I am not his bank. He said it's not about being bank but it was how I lacked basic empathy. That I knew he had no funds to even takes his kids out for a proper day out, no place to stay with them overnight and yet I never offered to help. That all I do is spend money on stupid selfish things. 

I asked him to leave. He left. Afterwards he did call me and apologize profusely saying he was upset cause he had seen his kids that day and they said something like he hated them cause he won't take them out. He was just frustrated with his situation and then I offered to take him on an international trip. I got where he was coming from and has accepted the apology. But this still bugs  me.

So today i come up to my house and there is someone parked in front of my house and they were still in their car, no big deal. But however the way they were parked they were taking up a lot of space in front of my house where two cars could have parked. So i pulled into my driveway and noticed the person was still in the car with it running, I politely asked her if she would’nt mind just moving her car back a little bit so i could park in front of my house. She only had to move like 5 ft back but she made this huge deal about it and was just super rude. I apologized and said i could park down the street if it was that big of an issue but she obliged (very rudely ofc). 

Idk to me I understand the minor inconvenience of having to move the car back, but she was in the car still with it on. I very politely asked her to move her car back so two cars could fit instead of 1. I also understand im not entitled to the street in front of my house… but idk the rudeness seemed unnecessary.

82,1c8tndq,AITA for occasionally mentioning that I hope my friend quits smoking?,"My friend John is a smoker. He's a smart, health conscious person - aside from this. John eats clean, works out, is super hygienic, well-groomed, so I honestly don't get how smoking fits into all of that. I used to smoke too, did for 20 years, but that was when I was drinking a lot and had a crappy diet etc. too so it kind of all went together. Now I cleaned myself up and quitting smoking was a logical part of that.

Because John is health conscious, we sometimes swap tips like what supplements we've heard are good, what fitness routines we are doing, what meal prep we are doing, stuff like that. Sometimes I say hey, the best thing you can do right now for your health is quit smoking, and he agrees, but he says he's not strong-willed enough to do it. I guess I mention it once every 2 months. 

I've recently started upping my antioxidants because of a neurological issue and John asked me about that. I told him, but I also said there's not much point him doing the same until he stops smoking. He told me I have to stop bringing it up, and he was obviously annoyed I had commented on it again. 

From my perspective, bringing it up shows I care. He's my friend, I want him to be healthy, I want him around a long time, and I don't get why he can't stop.

We became good friends and went on a few dates. Ultimately, it ended because I wanted to date and he thought that was ""too serious"". Despite my frustration at being informed of this fact 5 dates in, I tried to amiably part ways with him.

Over the next few months, he would try to remain in contact with me and try to initiate meet-ups. I declined each time, mainly because I had come to suspect that he looked down on my degree and potential career path for not being lucrative enough. Its worth mentioning that he is currently unemployed and is not actively pursuing any educational/vocational training. 

A few days ago, he texted me while I was in a class, trying to initiate a meetup. I told him that I would be going to McDonald's after class and if he wishes to talk, he could come there. He agreed. 

Few hours later, he asks me if we could go somewhere other than McD, somewhere with a ""better background"". When asked why, he responds that he wants to take good pictures of himself. I told him that I just wanted a burger and if he wants, we could go to an upscale coffee shop nearby and he could get himself a coffee and I'd take his pics. He said that he did not want anything and I could just order something at the coffee shop and take his pics. I informed him that this shop (that I have been to, on a special occasion) is quite expensive and I, being a college student, cannot afford it. 

He points to my profile picture on the app that we are texting on and asks where it was taken. I told him the place (which is a posh market). He argues that I can afford the coffee shop. We have that back-and-forth for an hour. 

In the end, I text ""I will just be going home then"". He reacts with a thumbs up to this message. An hour later, he is apparently there, despite my informing him that I'm going home.

My friend(23f) has an interesting life. I don't know how bad it truly was compared to how bad she made it seem. Her dad died a couple months before her birth and the family was awarded a generous settlement.

Her mom ended up investing all the money into a very seedy company and never used it on the kids growing up. She didn't have a job either, so as my friend described it, she grew up fake poor - they had money, but her mom refused to ever use it and constantly belittled her kids whenever she had to purchase things for them. Even the basic things like winter clothes, food, glasses, were all met with anger and hostility. Whenever friend did something her mom didn't like, she used this money and her will as a threat, implying friend would never see a dime. My friend says this started as early as 5 but I have my doubts. 

Well her mom is now dead. My friend didn't know much about the settlement until recent. A trust account is set up with her name on it, with her mom's name on it too. Despite the death, this company won't let my friend access it and has caused a two year legal battle just for her to take her mom's name off. 

She doesn't talk about it much other than to say how even from the grave her mom screwed her over. She brought up she wants to grt it figured out so she can attend college.

The youngest and I got bad colds this week. Thankfully we're the only 2 in the house so far to be sick. I was up most of last night with him because he was absolutely miserable, and today it hit me like a ton of bricks. The works x10. I had bad congestion and such head pain I could barely stand up. Matt was kind enough to leave work an hour early to take over and let me sleep for a few hours. 

I woke up to make dinner. Matt had let them snack while I asleep so no one ate much. I then went to do bath time. And this is where our issue is.

Idk what it is about bath time in the boys' bathroom, but Matt hates doing it. He hates sitting on the floor, he hates the fan running (it's too loud, even though he uses the fan in ours), and he hates how ""hot"" I let the room get. I generally like to keep it warm and the door shut because their 30 lb bodies dont retain heat as well as us adults can, plus Matt thinks anything over 70° and we might as well be in hell (even though he walks around in shorts and a t shirt). It has a window, and he's super jealous of it. He literally brings up once a week how he wishes we had one in ours. So I generally end up chilling with the boys while they play, wash them, and then calling Matt in to help dry off and do lotion and pajamas.

Today I decided to make it as sauna like as possible to help alleviate some of our symptoms. I had the fan running, but it got nice and steamy. The boys had an enjoyable bath, I felt a tiny bit better, and after a while I called Matt in to help with the wind down stuff. 

He immediately says he feels like he's melting. While I'm getting them out of the tub I notice he's left the door open. I ask him to shut it since I am taking them out of the water and dont want the draft. He does, grumbles under his breath, then goes over to the window and opens it. I ask what the heck does he think he's doing. He says he feels it's too hot. I say I don't give a fig what you feel. You're a grown adult in clothes, our tiny children, one of whom is sick, are wet and naked right now, and you're exposing them to freezing temperatures (below 30, it literally snowed earlier today, so much for early spring) just so you feel a bit better for 5 minutes. He tried to argue that I come in and turn the fan on and it annoys him, as if that was a bad thing to protect from mold! I just told him he was being ridiculous and to quit putting his comfort over his kids freaking health and safety.

The kicker is that he ALWAYS has the fan on, our bathroom gets 10x hotter than theirs (he takes 20 minute lava hot showers), and he dresses and gets himself ready in that hot steamy room BEFORE opening the door. But our little kids shouldn't get the same courtesy.

He didn't talk to me after and was short with me the rest of the night. I got a half a**ed sorry before I went to bed. I don't think I was in the wrong, but maybe I should apologize to keep the peace.",Asshole,2024-04-20,1.0,1.0352865,1,1

I got invited to a wedding of a distant cousin. It is an online invite and I have yet to RSVP (I've only had the invite for a short amount of time I am not being flakey). I don't want to go. We are not close, and I know my sister has RSVP'd. And anytime we go to the same event or anywhere together she turns my life into a living hell. It usually involves her dragging me dress shopping several times. Each time she is excited until she tries on the first few dressed and becomes really depressed usually leading to her getting upset, crying, and buying a dress she hates so we have to go out again later.

Then day off she will wake up really early and spent hours and hours trying on the different dresses, putting on makeup then taking it off over and over. Usually she becomes really upset within the first hour and will start crying and rapidly changing between outfits all of which look fine. I want to yell at her and tell her it's not about her no one is gonna care what she looks like, but I hold my words and try to be supportive. The issue is she gets MEAN. So usually by hour 4 she is crying, screaming at me and rushing between outfits while yelling ""i'm not fucking going"" over and over. She grabs her head and acts like she is stroking out yelling ""oh my god"" she will slam her wrists down on the table and slam doors. By the time she gets ready I've been ready for hours and I am an emotional wreck having panic attacks and wanting to go to bed.

Then we go to the event, and she is smiling, having fun and whispering furiously under her breath that I need to fix my face and drop the attitude.  Idk maybe it is because I am autistic, but I really struggle with shaking it off. I don't want to do this wedding because she will insist we get ready together and the thought makes me want to run away and never come home lol.

But every week she wants to go see her friends that are an hour+ away. Now I get it I want her to see her friends but I feel like I’m getting the short end of the stick since it is my car. I’ve never outwardly told her she could use my car for those reasons she just started to do it. I brought it up to her yesterday for only her to make me feel like the bad guy and that I was wrong. It felt like I was getting invalidated when I was just trying to communicate how I feel about it. Also I’m not saying she’s not allowed to see her friends, gas just gets pricey having to make those trips every single week. I told her once a month would be fine but I don’t have the funds to be affording long distance drives every week. She keeps thinking I’m trying to not let her see her friends and I so badly want to tell her that she should just make more friends in our area but I know she’ll get offended.

89,1c8sp8u,AITA for trying to make my girlfriend cancel her vacation with her grieving best friend?,"(English is not my first language so sorry in advance)

I (M26) have been dating my GF (F24) for almost two years. We met in university. My girlfriend has a best friend (F24) that she has known basically from birth, who I’ll call Claire. Since my girlfriend just has a brother and her best friend is an only child they’ve almost been like each others sisters, and both of their family’s are close, and have even been to multiple vacations together. Claire began dating Chris (M25) when she was 18 and he was 19. Ever since I met my girlfriend she has always spoken fondly of Chris, and that he’s a great guy. Which I know to be true as I’ve met him many times. My gf, Claire and Chris even shared an apartment before me and my girlfriend got an apartment together this winter. 

About three weeks ago, we got the shocking news that Chris had passed away. It was completely out of the blue.I don’t know exactly the cause, but I think his heart just stopped while he was sleeping. He was a fit guy who worked out a lot, and in great health, which just made it even more shocking. 

My girlfriend is understandably incredibly sad, and of course so is Claire. The last few weeks she has just been a shell of herself, and I don’t even have the power to imagine the pain she’s in. She has been staying at our apartment a lot since which she is more than welcome to. 

Here comes the conflict: Last year me and my girlfriend booked a cabin by a lake that I used to go to a lot as a kid. It has been fully booked the few past years because of an increase in popularity, and when we saw the empty spot last year just as we had moved in together, we took it. 

The thing is that Claire and Chris had booked a vacation to Spain that same week, and the trips overlap each other. Claire asked my girlfriend if she would like to go on the trip with her instead as it is nonrefundable, and my girlfriend said yes. She didn’t discuss it with me, she just agreed. I later brought it up when we were alone that that’s the week we were supposed  to go to the cabin and she just said that we would have to cancel it or that i could bring someone else.

I tried to bring it up again and she just snapped at me, and told me that we would just have to go another time, and that the timing was unfortunate. She said that we could still get money back from the booking of the cabin, if we canceled by the end of the week. I told her that we had waited for so long and she basically told me to get my head out of my ass.

I do get that my girlfriend and Claire are close, but I just done see why Claire can’t bring anyone else. The lake where the cabin is really special to me, and I had been looking forward to bring her there. I do get that it’s very delicate to try to discuss this now, but she just decided that we were to cancel our trip before even discussing with me.

I walk my dog off-leash in our neighborhood. I have my daughter in a stroller so it’s hard to keep track of a leash while pushing the stroller. We have a side walk and I make sure she stays on it or right beside it if it’s hot outside. I always pick up her poop if she needs to go. If there are kids out, I make sure we stay on the opposite side of the street just in case they feel uncomfortable. My dog is very well trained and will not go after children, dogs, cats, etc. and we wear a shock collar just in case she needs a little buzz. Someone confronted me and said I need to put her on a leash because he’s worried she will attack his dogs (I’ve never seen his dogs) and because it’s illegal. I told him I would contact the police to be sure. I contacted them and they said it’s not illegal in my area as long as she stays on the sidewalk. I saw him again recently and he confronted me again and I told him what the police said. I do my best to make sure nobody feels uncomfortable around her but it’s just so hard to keep track of a leash while pushing a stroller (she ends up wrapping me up in the leash).

I start lecturing her that she shouldn’t let the dog come up to me especially when my back is turned.  I don’t like surprises. She looks at me like I’m crazy and is clearly annoyed at my reaction.

92,1c8qpjr,AITA For not lying to the police for my family?,"Hey Reddit, I need some serious opinions on a situation that's tearing me apart. My family has always been close-knit, I'm talking great grandmother and below lives in the house, but lately, they've been swimming in deep waters.

The other day, the police showed up at their doorstep, asking questions about some seriously sketchy stuff my family is involved in. And let me tell you, it's not just a little white lie or a minor misunderstanding. We're talking about full-on criminal activity here.

So basically, my family got caught up in this business venture that turned out to be a front for all sorts of illegal activities. We're talking about fraud, money laundering, you name it. It's the kind of stuff that could make headlines and ruin lives.

Now, when the cops came knocking, my family immediately went into panic mode. They started Freaking out and my father answered the door in like a fake white suburban father act, acting like he had no idea what happened and agreed to get questioned, and he apparently had actual forged papers and passports in the house at the time. (that's all i know)

I know they were brought in and asked questions, but I don't know the details on that obviously.

Part of me understands where they're coming from. They're scared, desperate, and willing to do whatever it takes to stay out of prison. And yeah, they're my family, so I feel this sense of loyalty pulling me in their direction.

But on the other hand, I can't ignore my own safety. I believe that if I do this I might get brought into their problem. Lying to the police Would just put me in this crazy ordeal.

So now, I'm stuck in the middle of this mess, torn between loyalty to my family and staying true to myself. They see me as betraying them, abandoning them when they need me the most. And yeah, I feel guilty as hell for potentially throwing them under the bus.

They are making me feel like I'm betraying them by not helping.

But at the end of the day, I can't shake the feeling that maybe my family are not who I thought they were. I'm lost and could really use some outside opinions.

Yes, I understand this is a very easy decision, but I don't live with my family, and I haven't for a while. I have learned all of this within the past week or two and I'm just kind of lost at the moment, I believe they are already f'ed because of the forged papers so even if I do lie, I think I would just be equally as f'ed as them.

93,1c8qgdx,AITAH for not “caring” about my friends dog,"I 23F went over to my friend's 25F house to hang out on Wednesday. We do this often, and there haven't been any issues until this past Wednesday. We ended up ordering pizza and a few other things for dinner. Our food came with a small side salad that she didn’t want, so I ate it. I don’t like onions or cucumbers in my salad, so I picked them off, tossed them in the trash, and didn’t think anything else about it. We had a fun night, like we always do. 

I got a text from my friend saying that Elsa, her dog, had gotten into the trash and ate whatever was thrown out, and that's why she’s concerned. She asked how many onions I had thrown out, as she could see one of the rings on the floor. I told her it was about 5 rings of onions on the salad, and she started to freak out, saying it’s poisonous to dogs. I’m aware that dogs shouldn’t eat onions, but I also didn’t think the dog ate enough onions to make it sick. The dog is 85 pounds, and five onion ring shavings shouldn’t be as harmful as she was saying they could be. I texted her back, saying that I didn’t think the amount of onion the dog ingested shouldn’t be harmful but to keep me updated on any irregularities. 

Yesterday rolls around, and she tells me that the dog has diarrhea and she'll be taking the dog to the vet. I told her to keep me updated, and i’m sorry to hear that the dog has diarrhea. After the vet appointment, she told me that she thinks I should go half on the emergency visit, which is $300. I asked if the dog had any issues before I even commented on the bill. She told me that the vet said to keep the dog hydrated and that the dog didn’t have diarrhea while at the vet and seemed to be in normal spirits, so they didn’t prescribe or think the dog needed to stay for observation. They told her that if it continues to bring the dog back in, I of course agree. 

I ended up texting her about the bill, saying that I don’t really think it’s my responsibility to pay for the visit, being as though the dog got into the trash, and that’s something that animals do. She responded that if I didn’t throw away onions, this wouldn’t be an issue, and her dog wouldn’t have had to go to the vet. She then said that I was irresponsible for throwing away onions when she has a dog, but didn’t say anything while I was there throwing the onions away. She’s telling me i’m an asshole for not caring about her dog and not taking responsibility for making her dog sick. I didn’t respond to the message but I really can’t see how this is my fault. I was never told I can’t throw them in the trash and she never corrected me when I got up to throw them away. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,0.98100376,1,0
94,1c8pume,AITA for being annoyed with my friend who's always late?,"I (24M) am starting to get annoyed with my one friend who's always late and I don't know if I'm justified or just being uptight.

Just some context. All three of us are first year accounting students, I was only able to go to uni this year due some circumstances that I won't go deep into here, so I'm a few years older than them, we'll call them K and O. We meet on the first day of orientation and spend the majority of every weekday together following the same timetable and a groupchat.

K is mature for his age. I get along with K better than O and I don't think I'd really be friends with him if it wasn't for K sort of making us a trio. That's not to say I don't like him, he's very kind and intelligent; but I feel like he's very immature.

K and O live in the same building together just across the road from campus, and I live about a twenty minute drive away. They're almost always late to lectures, and it's almost always O's fault. He takes his time, and then something he didn't account for happens and he leaves late and K always has to waits for him.

But today it became annoying. We agreed that we'd go to a food market today, and all three of us agreed that I would be there to pick them up at 9:30. I let them know what time I would be leaving when I woke up. I left at 9:10 and shared my live location with them through Google Maps.

I got to their building at 9:28 and let them know I was there. I have to park in the road with my hazard lights on since there's no parking available - but the road isn't busy. K and a friend of his he'd asked to bring along came out at around 9:31. We made small talk and K decided to phone O and ask him where he was, O said that he was busy getting dressed and just had to take his laundry out.

We sat in the middle of the road for almost twenty minutes waiting for him until he finally came out the building - I'd told K if he'd not come out by 9:50 I was leaving without him. 

Later when we were at the food market about to leave, K's friend mentioned he'd only woken up at 9:00 - and O said he'd woken up at 6:00. I told him something along the lines of ""he woke up half an hour before he was supposed to be ready and he was still on time"". O said that he had to clean and do laundry, and I reiterated that we all agreed that I would be there at 9:30 to pick them up (but I didn't say that it was his responsibility to plan accordingly). He made a few remarks about how if someone says they'll be there at 12 he expects them to be there at 12:30 because he's on ""African time"". And that even on his first date with his girlfriend around the time they were supposed to meet he was still getting his hair cut but blamed the barber and said it wasn't his fault. He said that late people are always relaxed and not stressed, but I thought that you're not stressed but you're passing the stress on to the people waiting for you

95,1c8pscq,AITA for not wanting to sleep in the same bed as my dad’s friend’s kid? ,"I was on vacation with my dad, his girlfriend, and his best friend and their family.There were only  3 bedrooms and two living rooms. So I told them that my friends kid could have the twin bed and I’ll just sleep on the down stairs couch. Where it was pretty much it’s own room. For context, when we were little kids we ALWAYS had to sleep in the same bed because we were both only children and needed to learn how to have a brother or something.

 But at this point I’m old enough to drive so I figured I want my own place to sleep. Like our last vacation I had my own place on the couch but this kids was crying. My dad came out and told me to sleep in the same bed as him to comfort him and he told me to leave the second I got in there AND I WAS THE BAD GUY! So I got yelled at and he got off scot free and there was also a time in my dad’s life where he would constantly talk and compare me to this kid. 

So now that all that back story is out of the way I can fully explain what happened. I tell them I’ll just take the down stairs couch and my dad’s girlfriend becomes livid at me and demands to my dad that I sleep with that kid. And she start crying and begging to my dad and cussing me out. Then she starts going on about how when she was a kid she had to sleep in a bed with her siblings sometimes.

i don't like it it's ugly   
nobody will hire you and they'll treat you like a slut etc......

so today it's my cousins engagement  
I've picked a long black skirt and a black top with a black sweater above that so it looks less reveling and from morning till now she can't leave me alone about the piercing cuz there will be a lot of people there and what will they think

at this point I've had enough with her and part of me want's to let it out just to spite her

She is an alcoholic and mentally ill and immediately started  accusing my dad of abusing me and telling me I was possessed by Satan. For Christmas she got me a very malnourished German Shepard from a bad shelter, which I took ownership of because the shelters vet said she was healthy and just malnourished and I had wanted a big dog for a long time. I knew my parents would not let me move back in with a big dog but was planning on moving to an apartment soon so was ok with it. The dog began having constant gastrointestinal problems and wouldn’t eat for days. My last straw with the woman I lived with was her telling a neighbor I said he had stolen her house key and confronted him causing him to yell at my parents. I never said this.

Recently i and my parents had a discussion about this. I believe that kids should learn critical thinking skills and to manage frustration at least to a point and for that it is needed to not give them every answer nor do everything for them

The ""trigger"" was that i was letting my nephew play a game called klonoa on my switch, in a  level there was a door, an switch that would open said door and some enemies that could be grabbed and would explode some seconds after that. The thing is, The door would close by itself some seconds after hitting the switch, so he had to grab an enemy, throw it to the switch then run to the door, my nephew didn't realized what did he had to do. And to be honest, i didn't see him grab any of those enemies so i gave him a hint (grab one of those, trhow it and see what happens) he was still strugling to realize what he had to do. So i told him to stop and think a little.

After a while my dad got angry because i didn't outright tell my nephew what to do or do it outrigth for him.

some months before this, i had another discussion with my mom for a similar reason, the game in this case was mario & luigi superstar saga. My nephew was stuck in a tutorial where he had to learn how to use two new type of jumps (and most of the game requires using there plus other kinds of skills to advance) there was a text box telling him what did he had to do . But he didn't wanted to read so he didn't know what he had to do, half an hour passed until eventually he just readed the text box, but he didn't knew where to find one of the buttons required for this in the controller. Which was understandable since other games he played didn't required those buttons to play. So i told him where those were on the controller. After that he passed the tutorial quickly

During this my mom got angry because i didn't outrigth told him to read the text box (she never has touched a videogame, but she also saw the text box and didn't told my nephew to even attempt to read it to realia)

There are games that when he plays i always tell him about certain stuff, either because it's not obvius where to get the info he needs to advance or because he legitimately didnt understand a tutorial, so i would do it for him once as an example.

102,1c8ni1h,AITA for telling my half sister I ran away because of her? ,"Doing this on a throwaway because I use my main for non-personal content.

I have a half sister, Emily, who is a year younger than me. My mom and dad split custody of me while my dad had sole custody of her. My dad was kind of inept as a parent and basically tried to outsource Emily’s emotional well-being to anyone he could. In between girlfriends, that was me, whenever I was at his house. 

I hated Emily growing up. I hated being forced to play with her and take her everywhere, I hated my dad trying to get me to include her in everything.

For my last two years of school, I chose to live with my dad full time as my mom moved away and I didn’t want to change schools. I was meant to start boarding at school for those two years, but last minute my dad said I couldn’t since it wasn’t fair to Emily (basically him, because he didn’t want to put up with her). This left me in the house full time with Emily. Playing babysitter to her became so unbearable, I eventually “ran away” from home to live with my best friend. I lived with him until I finished school. 

After I left I kind of cut Emily off. She has always resented me for this. She takes it out on me by constantly bad mouthing me to relatives, telling exaggerated lies about me (my lifestyle, my financial situation, my job). I’m always having to correct people after the fact because of the weird stuff she says. I’ve never confronted her because I feel like this is her way to try and get my attention and I don’t want to engage. 

On Wednesday, we (me, my bff, Emily, her bf, and my dad and his gf) all had dinner. It was the first time we’d met Emily’s bf and we were kind of catching him up on our lives. It came up that I’d left home as a teenager. Emily chimed in and said I’d left home so that I didn’t have any rules, and basically alluded to me being a heavy partier, which isn’t true. I said that that wasn’t true, I left because Emily suffocated me and my dad wouldn’t do anything about it. My dad and I had a short back and forth about it and then it was over, but Emily started crying and left the table. She and her bf ended up leaving early. 

Later that night, Emily sent me a message digging me out for saying that in front of her bf. I responded by digging her out for insinuating I had a substance issue. She said I could have refuted that without bringing up how much I hate her (also denies that that was what she was getting at). I said she could have just avoided the whole conversation by not trying to lie about me with me sitting right there. The argument didn’t get anywhere so I just stopped replying. 

My dad is now getting it in the neck from her that I’ve ruined her relationship and am a giant bully. He thinks I probably shouldn’t have said what I did and that I should have just said we had our “differences” and left it there. His girlfriend, however, thinks I’m in the right.

103,1c8mpah,AITA for telling my sister not to vent to me anymore.,"I'll keep it short but my sister(F21) and I(M19) spend a lot of time together in general we go to the same university enjoy a few similar hobbies. As a result we've grown closer over the years only there's one problem my sister loves venting and complaining about all sorts of things.

I've previously told her I'm good at listening but she seems to require some feedback understandably so but I'd consistently tell her I won't just say empty words just to appease her. I'm pretty callous in all honesty but she expects me to bounce back and forth about stuff she's been talking about for an hour that has no significant bearing on my life. I try to be an ear that listens but she always demands I reply but I just think I'm feeding her lies/facedness which in turn makes me feel like shit.

Sure I could just say 'Yea I feel you, how did it turn out? how do you plan to handle it? etc but id just be speaking empty words. Last night I was sitting outside on the bench and she joined me and started venting about her girlfriends and I just shut her down told her that she shouldn't vent to me anymore since neither of us gets anything out of it. She tells me I'm being a prick and trots off. AITA?

I honestly couldn't see the point of this as Jane has done nothing special but to avoid drama I bought some stickers for her.

the day of the party it turns up that everyone either didn't bring gifts for Jane or just bought a gift from the dollar store like I did and SIL was MAD.

105,1c8m15e,AITA for refusing to stay in touch with an old friend ,"A male friend of mine whom I had known for about 5 years, and who is also married, handed me a confession of sorts, whilst  knowing I was in a relationship. (Infant I had just shared with him news of a turning point with my SO) 

He went on to state how ‘we could have been’, & implied how he chose not to hold me down blah blah.  

It just put me really off, our friendship had  been completely platonic. I had no romantic interest in him whatsoever, he claimed the same always.

To top it off, this friend also knew that all these years I had hopelessly been into my now SO. 

This friend of mine too had his own share of relationships until he finally got married.

Anyhoo, I didn’t say anything after just stopped all communication. Now six months later he has been texting, apologising & asking for his friend back etc etc.

I don’t want his apologies, we are good. I value what we had but because of what was said I can’t continue to stay in touch with him, not just cause he disappointed me but also out of respect for my own relationship. 

Now he keeps sending texts where he says sorry, sharing milestones and saying how I am making a big deal out of a few words, life is short, friends are rare. I am being unfair and one just doesn’t end a friendship etc etc. 

I wish him well n all. I just don’t want to stay in touch with him anymore but his messages are making me think am I wrong? if some one continues to apologise am I wrong to still not want to resume any friendship?

„I want you to stop talking about Tom (my cat) for a while.“

I was immediately taken back, why the hell should I stop talking about my cat? I then proceeded to ask her reasoning for that. 

„My dog literally died, I am really sensitive to hearing about pets or anything related to it, so just don’t talk about Tom for 1 or two weeks.“

I was quite frankly insulted by it, simply replying that she was overreacting. My girlfriend went on a rant about how nobody understands her, which I just ignored.

Am I in the wrong to be upset by this? She does it pretty frequently, but this was just getting on my last nerve. She claims that everyone around her does the same thing, and as such, it’s not a big deal.

110,1c8kwnm,WIBTA for not taking my mother in?,"I (28F) am being strong-armed to take my mother (53F) in so that my father (50M) could work abroad.

For context, my dad used to work 'til '13. He stopped working when I was still in college, so I worked to finish. I couch crashed to save up, and in ‘14, I moved in with my bf (29M). I graduated in ‘15, and worked continuously so I can have a better life, not wanting to worry how I’m gonna pay bills or groceries.

In '19, my mom suffered a stroke. Because of the lack of funds (and dad’s refusal to hold down a steady job), we couldn’t afford the hospital bills and my mom’s sisters bailed them out. We begged my dad to work, he’d use my mom as an excuse (aka can’t leave her as she can’t walk properly, she has to be assisted etc). TBF, my mom is at 50-60% mobility.

The pandemic hit and my dad wanted my siblings to stop studying because they can no longer afford it. My sister (23F) then was in her last 2 years of college, and our brother (20M) about to enter Senior HS (about 2 years before college). My sister begged me to take them, and I couldn’t let them down, so I took on the responsibility.

For 4 years now, I feed, shelter, even clothe my siblings. I provide everything they want. My sister has a Mac she used for school, and now she’s using it to work. My brother got my boyfriend’s 1 y/o laptop he uses. They never get hungry or bored or whatever in my house.

Recently, my dad called asking if our mom can stay with us as he got a job offer overseas. He said he plans to use his salary so my brother can effectively go back to school. (He stopped college studies because of my current lack of funds, but me and my sister are putting him up back to college later in Aug anyways) My dad is holding the possibility of a better life for him and my mom hostage, unless I take my mom in.

To be honest, I can’t live with them in the same house anymore. They feel like strangers to me now. They’ve abandoned me 11 years ago and I received no help since. I told them no outright, and they aggro’d back saying things like “When we’re bedridden, at least we know no one’s going to take care of us,” “If your mom dies, it’s on you,” “When your mom dies, you’re going to think maybe I should’ve helped.”

I’m being driven to guilt and I told my siblings and boyfriend about this. They think I’m not in the wrong to refuse to help and just accept the guilt, they think they’re accomplices too, and are willing to work through the guilt-tripping, but that I should stand my ground.

What I’m most afraid of is that, I take my mom in, shoulder all bills and stuff, and a year or less than a year, my dad goes home and moves in with me. (he hasn’t stayed in a job longer than a year before his overseas work; he is flaky and would resign just because he’d find some fault in the work he has) I’m scared that’ll be my life forever.

So, WIBTA if I tell them I can’t take my mother in, and if that means he can’t take the work anymore, then so be it?

112,1c8k3mu,AITA? Apparently I Forgot I Told Them I'd Babysit,"I really need to know, because I feel like shit over this. AITA? (No advice, please... just tell me if I'm the asshole, and why.)  
Our son, his wife, and our sweet grandson live 7 hours (driving time) from us. I was lucky to score a business trip to their home town, and my company booked air travel for me about 6 weeks ago.  
Usually we drive to see them and leave out on ""Sunday at noon""; however, my company booked my flight out for early Friday afternoon instead.  
I leave tomorrow morning to visit them, so tonight I snapped the kids and gave them the details of my itinerary. They already knew I was flying instead of driving this time, but this was the first they'd heard specific dates/times. (We are a fairly spontaneous family for the most part, so waiting until the day before departure to give the details isn't uncommon for us.)  
My Daughter-in-Law's  response to the details: ""We had talked about going to a wedding Friday & Saturday, but it's okay.""  
At first I was confused, thinking THEY had considered going to a wedding (thinking I'd be there all weekend to babysit) but now realized they didn't have a convenient babysitter; however, I quickly realized that her response was straight up snark (you have to know her well, but trust me on this one... she was laying out ALL of the passive aggressiveness).  
When I realized she meant that ""WE"" (she and I) had talked about THEM going to a wedding and me babysitting, I straight-up panicked. I could have puked! How could I have screwed something like this up? I would give ANYTHING to have two full days alone with my grandson.   
After I calmed down, I started to rationalize, and I truly believe that ""we"" (my Daughter-in-Law and I) never discussed a wedding and/or me babysitting. If we had, I would have been absolutely thrilled about it. I would have told my husband and mother (my two BFFs) about it. I would have been planning every moment of that time with our grandson and counting down the days. NONE of this happened.   
I'm old (53), but not THAT old. In fact, I tend to remember things that most people don't. I really think she's trying to pull one over on me. I love my Daughter-in-Law to death, but no matter how hard I try, I just can't ever seem to live up to her expectations. (That's another whole post.)  
Anyway, the little voice in my head keeps telling me I truly never heard a word about a wedding. I am almost positive that my Daughter-in-Law either:  
A) THINKS she talked to me about it, assumed I'd be available, and then needed a recovery plan when she realized I wouldn't be, or  
B) forgot to ask me, and is now trying to save face (or make ME look bad) in front of her husband (my son).  
Am I the asshole for secretly thinking my Daughter-in-Law is trying to cover up her own shortcoming by blaming me for ""forgetting"" something I knew nothing about, or am I the asshole for some other reason? ... because I'm definitely feeling like an asshole for almost missing alone time with my grandson.  :(",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,0.06867327,0,1
113,1c8jotk,AITA for not going to my in-laws because they try to give milk to my allergic daughter without telling me ,"Hello 

My daughter (5F) has been allergic to dairy products since birth. We had a couple of big scares and used an epipen. 

She was staying for a few days with my in-laws (61F and 61M). 

I have a difficult history with my father in law. There has always been tension between us because he thinks the baby/child should adapts to the adult needs and not the other way around. For exemple, if the lunch will begin at 1pm, young children should not be fed even if they are hungry at 11am. They must eat with everybody.

Yesterday my husband received a picture of her eating a croissant (we are French and this is cliché I know). Then she had Nutella. And then a quiche ! They never asked us if they could try to give her milk. They live in a farm and they lost the epipen. It is very unlikely that something bad would happen but you never know and emergency services would take at least 15 minutes to arrive. 

She was coughing a lot when I talked to her on the phone and I suspect she has a big reflux. My husband is picking her up today because I urged him to. Like the time they did not put diaper cream and the area was red raw ! 


I can't stand the fact that they have constantly disrespected me regarding the way I'm raising my childrenm 

At Christmas 6 years ago when I (34F) announced that I was pregnant for my dauther  he said in front of everyone that his son (34M) will be a great parent, then add ""I said my son, not my daughter in law"". Since I was taking care of preschool for my oldest (now 9M) organising birthdays, taking and picking my other son (now 7M) to day care, doing most of the activities with them, taking care of them when they were sick etc. I have Ehlers Danlos syndrome (fatigue, pain etc) and it's hard for me to vacuum, to spend hours cleaning the house. My husband helps me for that. 


Now I don't want our daughter to stay with them since I'm sure she is goint to be ok. The trust is broken.

114,1c8jj90,AITA for taking the master suite at a hen party?,"New to reddit after my boyfriend suggested I ask here. He said to say I'm on mobile. (Fake names.)

Me and my boyfriend, Jason were setting up a board game night with my bestie (Laura) and her husband (Colin). (I've been friends with Colin since before he met Laura.)

Jason and I got talking about Laura and Colin's wedding a few years ago, before he and I met. Laura's hen party weekend then came up, and I mentioned I had done a lot of the planning for it (which I enjoyed doing). We, a group of 7 hens excluding Laura, decided to book a weekend away in a lodge with a hot tub. Laura didn't pay for any of this, if it matters.

Laura's second closest friend (Rachel) had to quit their job due to caring responsibilities, and so their income was reduced, and they were going to drop out. I messaged them privately and offered to pay their share, and they could pay me back whenever the could afford it - I genuinely was not setting a time pressure. I had a good job and low cost living expenses at the time, so this was affordable for me, and I knew Laura would be gutted not to have this particular friend there, as they have known each other since primary school.

The rest of the planning goes well and the hen party weekend rolls around. There were 8 of us in total and 4 bedrooms with double beds. We were paired up in such a way that we were sharing a bed with someone we all felt comfortable with. I was NOT sharing with Laura, as one of the hens invited had been my friend longer than anyone else's, so we were sharing a room - I'll call this friend Anna.

It was a fantastic weekend and the only blip in the was when there was a bit of an issue with the rooms, as I was telling Jason.

I was the lead booker, and so arrived first to get the keys from the property owner. I drove Anna and I there. Anna lives quite far away from everyone, so I had to make a detour to pick her up. Anyway, we arrived first and had first choice of rooms, so we just took the master suite not really thinking about it or realising it was a big deal.

Laura arrives and finds her room and starts unpacking with her roomie. They both seem happy and don't say anything. But another hen, Una, after having a walk around the lodge, noticed that Laura wasn't in the master suite. She pulled me aside to suggest that Anna and I switch rooms with Laura and Rachel, as it was Laura's weekend, so should have the best room. I say that it doesn't really matter and I don't want to switch.

The next morning, I get a message from Colin that was a bit sarky, so clearly Una had went running to him. After this, Anna and I did switch rooms with Laura and Rachel.

In my retelling of the story, I was still a bit annoyed by it, and mine and Una'a relationship has never been the same since. But Jason said I was 100% at fault for trying to take the best room away from the bride and obviously I was the villain of the story and not Una but I disagree.

115,1c8jdo6,WIBTA if I said to my co-worker that she opt out of our birthday appreciation thingy,"A long one, so apologies. I (30,M) am part of a small sub-team from my work team that’s in charge of engagement and culture - basically organizing team outings, parties, etc.

It has also been in our tradition for the past 3 or so years to purchase a birthday cake for a birthday celebrant in our team, with the others pooling in to purchase said cake in the spirit of appreciation

Before, our sub-team collects the money from other teammates, purchases the cake and gives it to the celebrant, but now that inflation is getting out of hand, we first ask the celebrant if he or she still wants a cake, or a gift that can be more practical for him or her.

Now, we have a co-worker, Anne (fake name, 28, F), who is a bit problematic. While I do admit that I’m indifferent and biased against her, I don’t let that get into my head with this specific cake/gift thing as it is different.

When I asked her this is how the conversation went:

“Hey! Just asking you what do you prefer for your birthday? Gift or cake?”

“Cake.”

“Okay sure! But you’ll take a leave on your birthday right? So what will happen with that?”

“Yeah I will be out of office. Who normally gives the cake?”

“Well, you can opt for us to have it delivered to you, or if you want to be more practical, you can buy something you want, send us the receipt, and we can pay for it”

“Can I opt for a corporate gift card?”

“Uhm sadly we can’t do that as this program is not related to the company, it’s just within the team.”

And she didn’t reply to that.

After a day, Anne messaged another member of the sub-team asking whether she can use the funds pooled for her as “credit” so she doesn’t have to pool for cakes for the rest of the year. Which upon hearing that, I thought “What? Why would we fund your share for others, it doesn’t make sense.”

When we collectively said we can’t do that, Anne said to use the pooled funds to buy food for our next meeting as her “birthday treat” to us. Now, I scratched my head hearing that coz like, “So we’re gonna pay, for our food, under the guise that you bought it for us? Since you think it’s technically your money?”

Apparently, she asked her sister about the cake and said “If you are buying the cake yourself, what’s the point?”

I mean I get it, it doesn’t seem personal and more heartfelt, but given the situation, we are just asking her of her possible options - which up till now she still haven’t chosen any.

Now, here’s where I might be the a-hole, I suggested to the sub-team that why not she opt out cold turkey. She won’t get anything, but she won’t have to pay anything as well. It might result in her being isolated from the team more, which would definitely add a rift and awkwardness at work, but she’s just being so difficult.

116,1c8j6f7,AITA for declining to be my niece's godmother?,"Some background, I was raised in a pseudo-catholic family. My family identified as catholic but was never all that religious. My parents had me & my siblings baptized, had us go through communion & confirmation (this one reluctantly for me), but we never actually went to church & my parents never discussed anything religion-related. I became agnostic around 9 years old & considered myself atheist by 13. My brother is agnostic & my sister considers herself catholic. 

I personally don't agree with baptism. I have no issue with someone that is religious, it's just my own personal belief that it's not right to have a baby undergo a ritual to become part of a religious organization when they obviously can't consent & decide that for themselves. I think that's something they should choose when they're much older. & if they choose that, that's perfectly fine. I just think it's something that should be a choice. Some might disagree & that's fine but that's just how I feel.

So, my sister asked me to be my niece's godmother & I declined for that reason. My sister wasn't happy with me, she said that it wasn't a big deal & implied that I was declining because I didn't want a relationship with my niece.

So, my sister's mad at me & my Mom is trying to persuade me to change my mind but I feel pretty strongly about my stance. Curious what others think. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,0.02588408,0,1
117,1c8j5s2,AITA for unfriending someone because I don’t like the girl she’s friends with. ,"I am at that stage in high school where drama is just everywhere. I’ve tried my best to stay out of any conflict, But recently I’ve lost a friend because they were lying to me and being friends with someone I didn’t like. It may sound petty of me to be mad at her because of who she’s friends with but hear me out. I’ll call the girl who I’m not friends with Rachel and the girl I don’t like, Carly. 

I was best friends with Carly for a while until last year. At the beginning of 2023 I decided that me and Carly should stop being friends due to her being toxic and she would make slight comments about my weight and always do things that I asked her not to do. After I stopped being friends with her in early 2023, she made a fake account under her name and bullied herself and blamed it on me. She convinced everyone I was a cyber bully until they realized I wasn’t. This included Rachel and another girl who I’m suspicious of. 

Basically a whole bunch of stuff happened. And later in 2023 I found out that she is extremely bipolar, she beats her mom and cops have been called to her house multiple times. Before I found this out, I had started to rekindle a friendship with her in mid 2023 because I had thought she was better. She indeed was not. If anything she was crazier than ever. Now around end of January, I started to dislike her even more. Then she threatened one of my friends and that was my breaking point. I didn’t speak any words to her and I unfriended her on everything. I wasn’t mean to her. I just took myself out of a situation I did not want to be involved in. Around Beginning of 2024 me and Rachel had gotten closer than ever. I started to trust her more and told her everything. 

After everything happened with Carly, I kind of started to be skeptical of people. Rachel started becoming closer with Carly after it happened and Carly was finding out about stuff I had said about her that I only told Rachel because I was ranting. 

Before this started happening I trusted Rachel didn’t like her because she would always shit talk her every single day and say she was just friends with her to get info out of her ( which was suspicious ). After a while she started to show her true colors and started lying to me more. 

One day she was looking over my shoulder at my phone. I didn’t really want her looking at it bc I was ranting about a whole separate thing that was personal. She assumed I was talking about her and started this whole thing which got the school counselor involved. Two weeks later she started a whole thing with me over text. And I mentioned that I don’t really trust her because she’s friends with Carly. 

Because of everything that Carly did I didn’t really feel comfortable being friends with people who are closer with her because I couldn’t trust them.

118,1c8iwqs,AITA for not letting my mother give the my kids weekly pocket money. ,"So. My mam and I have a very strained relationship when it comes to my kids. She's doesn't get on with my husband.  We sometimes don't get on, i find i don't want to be around her. She has said some hurtful things to me about my kids.  Generally my and my husband parenting skills. I have two kids 9 and 6 both waiting to see if they had ADHD.  It's really fuckin tough at times.  I know I'm not the best mother.  But I'm here every day and I fuckin love them fiercely. 

So my daughter had a massive melt down over a Teddy bear. She didn't have enough to buy it. I had spent over £100 taking them out for food, activities in one day. I brought my mam along along as she misses the kids much to my kids and upset. I get this text daily.  Even though she sees them at least once a week, sometimes twice a week when they stay over. My mam had given me money towards this day out which I tried to refuse but she wouldn't take it back. So after a hour or 2 of my 9yr old crying over a Teddy and the back chat I was done. It really spoilt the day, I was really upset as just wanted to spend a nice day with my kids. And my mam was there watching.  I felt completely judged. My mam mentioned the money she gave me. I said if you want to take it back and give it to the kids you can do. But I'm not giving her the extra money.  She needed to learn and understand I can't just pay for everything they want. So I think this is where she wanted to give them pocket money. 

We don't regularly give our kids pocket money as my hubby and i have different ideas about. 

So I mentioned to my mother that I wanted to open a savings account for my kids.  To have on a big birthday.  So my mother wants to do the same. Fine. Also now she wants to open their first bank account and pay weekly pocket money in to it. I feel we haven't decided the rules on pocket money so we don't want her to open their first account,  taking them with their books to draw out money etc. My mam has a long history of doing things behind my back with my kids. Even though she knows I don't like.  Like she tired to potty train my daughter. 

So I said. Weekly pocket money in to a bank - no. If you want to give them cash once a month to spend on whatever fine..but opening their first bank and her having control and taking them in etc no, that's our job. Now she's ghosting me and I really can't be bothered.  I feel guilty I have upset her but I'm really tired of feeling guilty ALL THE TIME.

So am I the asshole here? Help a mam out.

119,1c8ip61,AITA for almost getting caught by my sister/roomate?,"\*\*\*\*Edit\*\*\*\*

At no point did I say it was on the couch, or even indicate where this happened. The point of the post is, if it's reasonable to demand that your roommates not interact in any intimate way if you're present or planning to even (apparently) POSSIBLY be present in the home.  I could have done all this in the bathroom and she still would have had the same response. It's AITA for doing it at all, not the where. 





To be clear, everyone is an adult. Okay so I text my sister when is she going to be home? She told me 9:50, because she gets off work at 9:30. So at 9:15 (I got the baby asleep in bed at 9pm mind you) me and my BF of two years start to fool around. We get done pretty quick bc I'm pregnant too 🤪 and I'd say its 9:30 and my sis starts unlocking the door to come in! We were both pretty decent and not in the act of anything but my BF still had to put his shorts on lol. So anyway my sis gets hella mad about it. Talking about how we can just fuck when she's not here then. I took her in a week after our first was born and between the baby and her I barely have intimate time with my partner. I expressed that to her and she stayed indignant. Am I the asshole? I did try and time it out to where she wasn't home. This was the first time she's caught us, and has lived with us for over a year.",Asshole,2024-04-20,1.0,1.062447,1,1
120,1c8ip2t,AITA/WIBTA if I remove someone's clothes from the washer? ,"So just to keep things relatively short, I (25M) have lived in this apartment for about 3 years now. The apartment building I live in consists has six tenants including (not including possible family members/roommates) living in this particular complex, and only one washer/dryer.

There have been countless times where I have wanted to wash my laundry, but one of my neighbors has left their clothes in the washer for countless of hours at a time. Rather than just take them out, I've always just left them there and periodically checked to see if they were finished to no avail. As a result, throughout my time here I've been doing my laundry at night time as during the day time I've found that people tend to leave their laundry in either the washer or dryer for hours at a time.

However, recently it has also been happening at night time in which a neighbor has left their clothes in the washer/dryer, and I still have to get my laundry done. AITA if I remove their clothes from the washer/dryer after giving them what I believe is enough time to have gotten their laundry washed?

It's currently past midnight and I am so tempted to just take their clothes out of the washer and start my own load if they still haven't done anything with them in the next 30 mins to an hour... From my time tracking how long it takes the washer to finish from start to completion, it only takes about 33-34 minutes, and then the dryer takes about 45 mins to an hour to complete, so I feel like waiting an additional hour or so is enough time before I just say ""fuck it"" and take their laundry out of the washer and put them on top of the dryer.

I feel like I've been my best to be as considerate as possible so as not to be an asshole as maybe they might be preoccupied with something but for the first time I'm losing my shit and am tired of people being inconsiderate. I feel like it isn't hard to set a timer and get your laundry done in a timely manner, especially since there's only one washer/dryer.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,0.007654703,0,1
121,1c8hvxe,"WIBTA for trying to get my classmate ""fired"" without confronting him first?","I'm 15\[F\] and the classmate in question is 15\[M\]. Let's call him Sam. For context, in my school we have a prefect system, which is basically the equivalent of a student council but leaning more to being sort of teahcers assistants. Sam and I are both prefects. Our main gig is to enforce discipline in the school and become good examples to other students. A little bit of backstory, in our first year of secondary school we became prefects in training, which was pretty much like a prefect internship. The standards to becoming a prefect were not that high, just abide to the rules, set a good example and be a generally good person.

  
Sam is your average case of ""the guy who thinks he's the cool class clown but is actually just obnoxious"". And I get it, that's pretty much unavoidable in high school, but not a good look for a prefect. He's been like this for as long as I have known him, yet it's seem to have gotten worse recently.  
Less than a month ago, three of my classmates, all 15\[F\], were out having dinner together when Sam texted each of them individually saying ""can you screenshot the homework?"". The homework he asked for wasn't specified and they were busy. So, they used one of their phones to collectively voice message Sam asking what homework he wanted and how they couldn't get it to him at the time. Somehow, one thing led to another and he bursted out and said how these girls were pick me's, how they ""had no self-respect"", and how they were ""r\*tarded"". He deleted those messages, but has not given any apology whatsoever, which says a lot. I wasn't there when it happened, but these three girls told me about it and I was pretty much infuriated. Still am.

  
Now I'm aware that this might seem like a problem that should be dealt with between them, but this is not the first time Sam has done something like this. For the past 3 years of being a prefect he has been extremely disruptive in class, is very racist, has even been bullying another classmate of ours. is overall rude to most of the girls in class and has gone even so far as to being rude and disrespectful to our own teachers. His behaviour has gotten to the point where our Islamic Studies teahcer, infront of the entire class, said that she prayed that Sam would no longer hold the role of a prefect. 

  
I've contemplated confronting him in person about his behaviour, but knowing him, everything would probably just go in one ear and out the other. He also has almost 90 percent of our male classmates on his side, even another prefect that I geniuenly looked up to. But something in me feels a bit unsettled about reporting it to the higher-ups without talking to him first. Still, I'm scared I might get targeted by him or something like that. But either way, I know I should do something about it.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-20,0.0,0.99807197,1,0
