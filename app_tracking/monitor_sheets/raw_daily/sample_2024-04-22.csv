0,1ca1nyb,WIBTA for yelling at my grandmother,"I (18 F) have grown up with my Grandmother's constant belittling and managed to deal with it for all of my life. She has always said I'm a ""gifted child"" and expected good things from me. She has called me Doctor (insert my last name here) my entire life and set a lot of pressure upon me. She is very selective with which grandchildren she loves and I have always been 'lucky enough' to make the 'cut.' This affords me better Christmas presents but also drunk and passive aggressive texts.

I'm a junior in highschool and am in the process of looking at colleges. Against my grandmother's wishes, I want to go to school for early childhood education instead of something in the sciences. When I was at her house last, I told her about this. She asked me if I thought that was actually something I'd be good at and implied I wouldn't. I have been working in childcare almost all of my teenage life and I pride myself on my ability to make children feel safe and loved. Throughout the entire conversation she made me feel small inside and like I would have no success in that field. This is what I've been dealing with for a while and was able to handle it.

However, she soon started discussing how I could cure diseases if I put my mind to it. She referenced my Grammie (whom I loved very dearly and died semi-recently from cancer) and very heavily implied that I could save people like her. It was awful because I felt like a terrible person for not becoming a doctor and saving lives.

I ended up leaving the kitchen, but later that day at the breakfast table she cornered me in another discussion. She talked about how I would be abandoning my family if I went to a college that was far away and I had a duty to them. My family is incredibly important to me but I've always longed for the feeling of independence. I tried to explain this to my grandmother but she said ""we all want that, it's just not realistic. You have people here who need you."" (Keep in mind I don't even live with my family at this stage and instead attend a boarding school so??)

I sat through the entire lecture and held my tongue. When it was over, I gave her a quick hug and my dad and I left. I cried on the way home. I told my mother what happened and she recounted a similar experience that happened a week or two prior. I recently had a mental health related incident and my Grandmother insinuated my mother wasn't doing enough to support me. This absolutely broke me inside because my mother has always done her best for me.

I've decided I don't want anything to do with my Grandmother anymore. I won't ask to see her and I won't reply to her passive aggressive text messages. 

But eventually I will need to visit her, and when she comes after me, my mother, or anyone else in my family again I will speak up and call her out.

1,1ca1lfs,"AITA for saying ""That's it?"" To a nearly empty box of food?","For context I'm getting ready to see my partner for dinner and I ask while I was at the store if there was anything extra I should get qnd offered suggestions. I had a bag a brussle sprouts and was told to put it back because it was already too much food they said they had food from a restaurant we frequent. Fine. No problem. 
I had other stuff to eat at home besides it was fine. 

  So I get home and I start preparing to heat up dinner and what normally is like 6 prices of catfish, 4 fried shrimp some fries and hushpuppies what we normally get. I opened the box to see a single piece of catfish, a single shrimp and a single onion ring. 

So this is where my reaction of ""That's it??"" Came in and I feel like anybody expecting a 'feast'would have the same reaction opening the box to that. This reaction sparked a whole argument over something that really didn't bother me in the first place but I feel this is a normal reaction to being told there would be enough food at home when in fact is was a meal they had at work left over their boss brought. No problem. Don't care if she ate but somehow this was something worth fighting about. And apparently it's all from me saying ""that's it?""

2,1ca1j1y,AITA for leaving my family for my best friend,"I 20f have live in California which is a very expensive state to live in average rent is over 1.8k for just an apartment. Me and my best friend 20f have been talking about me moving over there, a state thats cheaper even though the wage is lower. The main reason want to move is my parents, I love my parents, but I feel like ever since I was born every decision Ive made has to be run by my parents first, I have never had a chance to do what I want, I was even sent to a trade school to become a MA, being in this field is not for me, dont get me wrong the whole experience was fun to learn, but its too stress for me

But my parents and job arent the only things, I hate every single thing about my life in California, my job, my life, my religion, I hate everything that goes on in my life. And my parents dont understand that the only thing that has kept me going is my best friend, even when I was at the losest point in my life, but she has helped me through all of it, shes even told me to go to therapy, but every single thing shes helped me with my mom thought it was a bad idea

My mom was confused why I needed therapy, why I needed antidepressants, which both have been helping so much. However, a big reason I hate my life is because of my religion, especially the people in the church. My pastor, my parents have been telling my that god has been blessing my life and been helping me, saying that ""Living underneath the pew"" was a blessing. I hope this doesnt sound rude, but my life has been a living hell since I was a kid, I've had girls I thought were my friends bu//y!ng me, classmate in my 8th grade class ""disappear"" from cancer, as I kid I thought I was cursed, bcuz everything I pray for ""disappear"", just everything in my life was hell. There are so many times I want to leave this religion, to leave this state so that everything that happened in my childhood just goes away, but to me it wont go away if I don't leave this state, my parents will still make me go to church, my mom will continue to ask when I'll have kids, when I'll get married, I don't want to get married, I dont want to have kids. And to those who think that since Im young I still need time to think over those ""rash"" decisions

My parents have been asking when I'll have kids since I was 14 and never been in a relationship

My dad keeps reminding me that its basic knowledge that every kid will marry someone that is like that parent, so if I marry a guy he’ll act like him. My dad has terrible anger issues, and ever since he reminded me every day I fear the idea over marrying someone like my dad and my siblings are no better, my little sister constantly reminds me of my issues, my weight, my hyperfixations, by the way I weigh 180 lbs and 5'9, I've been trying so hard to lose this weight, and that's not even the worse part, my older sister, reminds me that I act just like my dad which only makes me want to leave this family even more",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,0.0,0.0179997,0,1
3,1ca1gjp,AITA for not choosing the dates my friend wants?,"Let's call my friend ""Charlotte."" Charlotte and I, along with several other friends, are trying to plan a camping trip in August. Charlotte and I are graduating college, the rest of our friends are not. Charlotte is moving to another state, rather far away. For the camping trip, we originally selected August 24th-28th. However, today Charlotte told me she actually wants the dates to be 28th-1st, as she also wants to see some other friends in the state of our college who will only be there the 2nd, and she feels she cannot take a second trip to see these friends because of time and money. However, the rest of the camping friends said they did not want to change the dates for various reasons. I also told Charlotte that I thought the original dates would be better. Now Charlotte is annoyed with us, but also specifically me because this trip was mostly my idea to begin with. She says I should prioritize her wants because the rest of us, being in the same state, can see each other pretty easily any other time. She also said she thinks that we should just not even talk about it until it is closer to August. Is she correct? Should I insist that we use her preferred dates? One friend already said they will not come if we do that, but Charlotte has implied she will not come if we use the original dates. I am struggling to deal with this.

4,1ca1dp0,AITA for going to my sisters dream destination without her?,"For context: I 29F and my sister 35F have birthdays 6 days apart. We grew up poor and are mom was an addict so we never really celebrated birthdays. This may be the reason my sister is super weird about her birthday. She always seems to have a problem if I celebrate my birthday. Saying hers is first and should be celebrated first. However I always plan my own parties or make plans for mine, she excepts others to. So if I or someone else doesn’t do something for hers, he gets mad if I celebrate mine. 

Last year she made a huge deal because my friends made tshirts with my face for my birthday but no one did anything “special” for hers. I took her for drinks and dinner.

I’m turning 30 this year on the 30th so I wanted it to be special. I told my sister that we should spend travel to Thailand and Bali. We’ve both always wanted to go. She agreed, this was about 8 months ago.

I’m doing all the planning, she’s agreeing. I sent flights and things seems to be going as planned. When it comes to booking the hotels, she states she doesn’t have the money yet. I say okay no problem, I’ll book and you give me the money later.

A month before I just start getting weird because she still hasn’t given the money, but everytime I mention it she says yes she’s forsure going. Another week passes and she confesses she doesn’t have the money.

I agree that I’ll pay all the hotels and all she needs is the spending money. She confesses that she never even brought the ticket.

She then says I could probably cancel and get credit for the airline. I laugh and say well I’m still going obviously. She gets so upset saying that I’m going to her dream designation for her birthday and how that’s so wrong. 

She gets more upset when she learns our mutual friend sent me some money to help cover since she lied to me right before the trip and I now have to cover everything on my own. 

She keeps replying to all my stories snarky, and calling me a golden child. (We both grew up in foster care, and didn’t have active parents or foster parents). 

I was talking to my brother about it and he said he understands her pov, that she just wants to feel special. He said I should have paid for everything including her ticket as I make more money or that I should have pushed it back so that it’s not over her birthday. Now I feel bad, but I just want to be able to celebrate myself in peace without constantly worrying about offending my sister. So AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,0.0,-0.0057247896,0,1
5,1ca13i8,WIBTA for wanting to back out of being a bridesmaid in my friends wedding? ,"I feel at a loss on what to do. A little backstory:  I, 27F, was asked to be a bridesmaid in my friend’s (29F) wedding. We were roommates during college in 2014 and have been friends since then. 

This past weekend was her bachelorette party and last night things went downhill so fast. I traveled over 3,000 miles to be apart of her weekend and stayed awake for 40 hours traveling to her. The first night was super fun but things started going downhill Friday night when I ran into an old friend from home and I stayed to catch up for a couple of minutes and I spent $60 on shots to make it up to the bride who was annoyed that I stayed back to talk to a friend for a couple of minutes. She then makes me sleep downstairs alone when the rest of the girls are sleeping in her room upstairs. 

Saturday was the worst day when we went out for drinks and when we started to go to different bars, the bride was already drunk, didn’t have her phone and kept running off in a jammed packed bar in Nashville. Eventually the MOH snapped because the bride ran off again without her phone and we couldn’t find her. The bride just starts having a meltdown saying because she was yelled at, it ruined the night. The bride wouldn’t talked responsibility for running off and scaring us and saying she couldn’t handle her emotions and I stayed quiet the rest of the night. I kinda realized that the whole weekend I felt as if I was walking on eggshells around her because I was afraid of her having a breakdown like that and seeing she was still acting as immature as she was before.  I just started a new chapter of my life and cut off people like that and I just feel very uneased on what to do. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,0.0,-0.0075837104,0,1

 I didn't understand this at all and thought he was just being stupid. I asked him if he wanted my brother to be mean to him but he said no and that he didn't know what he wanted but he just wanted my brother to stop being perfect. This just caught me off guard and I kept rereading the message trying to think of something to say because I just felt like he was being stupid.

I told him that he was being dumb and that my brother was not perfect in anyway and I was just trying my best to help him feel better. This did not work and he started arguing with me for being wrong? I told him that he was stupid because I don't see why he's mad my brother likes him and I don't understand how he can be so smart and dumb at the same time.

7,1ca12cd,AITA for getting my father to fund a disney trip before cutting contact,"i (17F) have struggled my dad's terrible parenting for years. he has consistently neglected me and made me feel unlovable/unloved. recently, i discovered he's only my adoptive father. unbeknownst to me, my parents got married while my mother was pregnant with me (from another man). this man had previously had two children with my mother. My older sister (19) and brother (22). although my brother is a fine person, he has been too busy to make any real connection with me. however, my sister goes to same school as me and we have become very close.

my sister dealt with her own form of trauma in her youth and was forced to grow up extremely fast. due to this, she often finds herself longing for typical 'childhood experiences.' for example, she loves plushes and other stupid toys, watching children's shows and generally acting like a kid when she has the chance in order to create better memories. she has often dreamed of going to disney (with people other than her highly dysfunctional family who spend the whole time bickering).

my father has been getting worse with his treatment of me to the point where im considering taking legal action to make sure he stays out of my life for good. before i do that, im tempted to make him pay for a trip to disney like he promised me a while back but to also pay for my sister as well. i plan to cut contact with him shortly after said trip and take legal action if necessary. for reference he makes about 7 figures a year and can definitely afford the trip.

It can get uncomfortably quiet in there. We have a new-hire and he plays music on the work computers out loud. I really have no problem with this and I think it's a nice change. It's normally video game music or lofi music which again I really don't mind. 

The other day I had a massive migraine and he was playing some metal music out loud. I'm normally into alternative/metal/rage music but I was about to have a complete meltdown from being overstimulated and my head hurting. Should I have just moved further away from him? Maybe, but I'm training him so I need to be nearby. I first started just complaining that I had a migraine and it sucked hoping that he'd get the hint. But he didn't so I told him that I don't mind if he plays music but to please play something more chill and quiet. I feel bad for asking him to change the music but I was just reaching the end of my rope and for fucks sake it was 7:30am. He was grumpy for the rest of the day and made training him miserable for the entire day. 

Was I the asshole? Should I have just sucked it up? Would anyone else react the same way?

Edit: I should clarify that at no point did I raise my voice at him. I enjoy him as a coworker and I'm not wanting my trainee to quit so I obviously never raised my voice.

Last time I went out with her, she had promised my partner that she would take care of me and look out for me, that night she broke her promise and left me by myself for half the night, she than came back with a bunch of guys. Ever since then I stopped going out and focused more on my job, physical health and relationship. 

For the last few months, my partner and I have had a feeling she has something for him, she kept trying to get close to him, dismissed me whenever we hung out with her. The last time we saw her was early this year for her birthday, the whole time she was trying to get touchy with my partner; he kept walking away and holding me. Last weekend, we decided to test her and see what she would do. I had my partner message her and start flirting with her (i was reading the messages and talking to him), the whole time he was complimenting her, sending her x’s and calling her nicknames such as hun; not once did she message me anything about it.

However, when I visit I don't mention it and have just talked about it with my husband. 

Yesterday I told to my husband we should go visit his mom for Mother's Day. Rob's parents are doing some home repairs so the bedroom we usually stay in is not available and we would have to sleep in a very uncomfortable spare room.

I told Rob we could stay at a hotel this time and that I would pay for it. He mentioned he would think about it as he rather stay at his parents to spend more time with them, so he would consider going on a different date.

My sister has a performance that weekend but she called today to ask if she should get us tickets so I asked my husband if he had an answer as to when we'd  visit my MIL. If he said we were not going on that weekend, then I would get tickets to go see my sister perform. He told me he wasn't sure about it and that it would be better for him to go alone to see his parents so I could go see my sister. 

I mentioned Rob it was more important for me to go see my in-laws as I know I can catch my sister performance in another date, so he should not be concerned about my sister's performance at all. He replied to me that if it was his sister who was performing (he has a twin btw who moved countries) he wouldn't miss the performance. 

I asked Rob if he didn't want me to come to see his parents and he started saying that I was the one not wanting to see his parents as I was not willing to stay I  the spare room. 

I got really hurt as I was the one bringing in the idea to visit them in Mother's Day and I had also bought my MIL a present already and my husband knows about it.

I started crying as I felt that I'm not his priority, as he is not willing to comply just this time. He replied he is doing so as he cares about my finances and that I was exaggerating.

I waited to hear all of their seatbelts click which never came. I asked if they could fasten their seatbelts and they looked at each other with confused glances. After a solid minute, one of them broke the silence and asked ""Wait, you're serious?"" and which I said ""Yeah?"". 

They asked why and I said the obvious reasons: safety and I don't want no tickets if we happen to get pulled over. One chimed in correcting me saying ""the driver doesn't get a ticket, the passenger does"". I sat there for a second and said ""If you don't fasten your seatbelts, I'm not taking you guys anywhere."". They both let out a bunch of scoffs and exited the car. I said ""Suit yourself"" and drove off. Leaving them in chilly weather, on a dark night. With a 20 minute walk home.

20,1c9zdsj,AITA for respecting my parents boundaries and staying home with my puppy?,"I (33F) am an animal person, always have been, but my parents are not. We had a dog growing up and my parents kept it outside in a “pen” 24/7, 365 days a year, for 15 years with no exercise or mental stimulation, and still to this day think it was fine. Since the day I moved out I have had my own dogs, and just got a puppy after losing my boy dog over the summer who was 11. 

My kids (3&5) , husband(33M) and I are animal people. I’ve worked in animal care for 15 years working in dog daycare, boarding, pet supplies, dog trainer and vet tech. My parents have always resisted my love for animals and have always had a boundary that my dogs are not allowed over. For a long period of time that was fine… I lived close by and my dogs were comfortable being left home for long periods of time, so it was easy for me to leave them home and go for a visit. 

Now, I live over an hour away with a 3 month old puppy who can only be left a few hours at a time. I got a different breed this time which is much more people oriented than my last dog and it’s taking longer to build comfort being left alone. I am not comfortable having someone come and pet sit as I also have an elderly dog with specific care that’s needed and lots of supervision is required between the two dogs right now. I would just not be comfortable with it. I also will not send our puppy to boarding/daycare, I am very familiar with the facilities around here and simply won’t use them, plus our puppy doesn’t have all of his shots yet. I am putting some serious hard work into training this puppy to be the best dog he can be. 

My husband is traveling for work this week and my parents said my kids and I should come over for a visit. I mentioned that I would love to, but that I would have to decline because I wasn’t willing to leave our puppy home for that long. My parents got angry, saying I was preventing them from seeing the kids. I said I was respecting their boundary and unfortunately it comes with the consequence of visits being harder and less frequent, but that I am happy with my choice and this is my lifestyle. They also won’t come to visit us because of the animals (two dogs and a bunny). My mom blames allergies but I know she takes an allergy pill to visit my sister who lives right down the road from them, and she has a cat. The conversation ended with my parents saying I was being vengeful and that IATA.

My mother (58 F) and I (29 M) live in different cities about 70 kilometres or 44 miles apart. I recently moved out about 2+ years ago and I live with my partner and two pets, while my mother lives with my grandfather in his house. 

Every now and then, she wants to go away for a weekend or stay away for a few nights. She hasn’t yet due to the fact that she’s uncomfortable leaving my grandfather alone at home due to his age, especially overnight (he’s 89). This is due to him being elderly and not a direct result of any life threatening medical conditions. 

As a result, once or twice a month she’ll message me and ask me to come over so she can go away without having to worry about him since someone’s home with him. The requests have varied from a weekend to 3+ weeks. (Mind you I have a full time job and other commitments including a part time content creation gig). 

 When I say I have work during the week she makes the excuse that “people drive 100km each way daily for work, so you can’t make that excuse”. When I say I don’t want to leave my partner and pets for the weekend, she says “bring them all here, they can stay for a few days”. Mind you I have a dog and a cat and I can’t just “move them in for a few days”. 

While I understand that she’s unable to go on a trip or do any overnight activities as a result and that does suck, in my opinion since she lives there that’s on her. She enjoys the perks of living there like free rent and utilities, and should share some of the cons like not being to do an overnight trip.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,0.0,0.030832278,0,1
22,1c9yv5r,"AITA for ignoring my mom's messages?
","I moved out of my family's house 8 years ago. I've been supporting myself and helping my mom with her car insurance payment every year and occasionally sending her money whenever I can. True be told, she does help me with some money every now and then as well. On my vacations, instead of using the money (when there's enough) to travel somewhere nice, I always go to her house so I can spend time with her and my family. I always say I'll stay for just a week but end up staying longer than that.
In this 8 years, she visited me a total of 5 times and mostly because she can get medical appointments here through her insurance which was the case this time.
She came on Sunday, we went to her appointments on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning. From her appointment on Wednesday we went straight to the hospital so I could get admitted for a small surgery that I had scheduled . I got released that very same day by evening, we came home and she was scheduled to leave on Friday. On Thursday, I asked her to stay one more day (I wasn't in a lot of pain, but it was uncomfortable and weird since I never had any kind of surgery before). She said she couldn't because she had left her dogs with my uncle and he had hurts his feet. I asked her again on Friday and She gave me the same response, saying the she needed to pick up her dogs because she was already left them with my uncle for too long (mind you, my uncle and aunt love those dogs). So I bought her a gelato (cause the last time she came here, she loved it, as there's no place she can have those in her city) and we went to the bus station. I barely said a word to her during our way there, didn't really hug he goodbye and left cause her bus was already there. I cried the whole way back home. 
She message yesterday, saying that she knew I was angry but that it was just 'incomprehensible' and that she wouldn't say anything and we would talk when I wanted. She sent some voice memos about random stuff, but I didn't answer. She sent me a voice memo again today saying that if I can hold a grudge, so can she. She's also asking for my help with a loan she wants to make, cause those things are done online now and she doesn't know how to do it. I still didn't answer her.
I feel like is really petty of me but I felt really hurt when I asked for just one more day with her and she refused because of her dogs, when I'm the one always sacrificing possible fun vacations to go be with her and always stay longer when she asks.
Am I the asshole here?


UPTADE: She messaged me again today, saying that she asked me to  help her with the loan and that I ignored her. I took on what some of you said to me and sent her a long text explaining to that I'm really hurt and that I can't just talk to her as if nothing happened, that it felt shitty when I asked her to stay and she gave me that response and that I'm taking my meds and I'm fine but I just can't talk to her right now. 
She sent two voice memos, saying that I had every right to be upset but that I'm failing to see her side. That she didn't go back because of the dogs but because my uncle got injured and that she felt sad leaving me. But there's something she said that made me even more upset cause is something she always says when she wants me to cave in ""It's okay, I won't say anything"". Whenever we have a disagreement and she wants me to say that I'm wrong, she uses that phrase, it's like her way of saying ""do whatever you want"". She also said that I shouldn't expect any messages from her and that whenever I want to talk, I can cause she's not gonna stop being my mom and will always be here for me.
I haven't reply and don't think I will. I feel like the best thing right now is to put some space between us and focus on my recovery as I still have exams, medical appointments and another small surgery ahead.
I thank you all for the advices. Telling her everything didn't actually make me feel any better but it gave me a sense of what to do from here on.
I hope you all have a great day!

23,1c9yq9v,AITA For Telling My Dad That He's The Reason I've Been Stressed?,"I (15F) have had divorced parents since I was a baby, both my parents are petty and make it their goal in life to see each other suffer, with no regards to their children. I have an older sister (16F) who is rebelling specifically against my mom, because my sister is falling school, and sneaking out and my mom punishes her for it.

Earlier this week, my mom found my sister sneaking her phone from our dads house to our moms (which has been a rule since i was young and my mom is strictly against us bringing our dads phones)  and my mom took it, and my sister decided she would run away from home.

My sister was technically missing for 3 and a half days before my dad took her back to our moms. My dad did not tell me or my mom that he had my sister for 3 and a half days (he legally didn't have to but still). Me and my mom were worried. I first saw my sister while i was transitioning houses from my mom's to my dad's and i was in shock from seeing my sister who i thought could be hurt, or kidnapped, safe with my dad. When i was in the car with my dad, he was casually asking me about my week, like nothing happened. That immediately made me sick to hear. It felt like he was only trying to get to my mom, but he made me feel like i was only an attachment, like he didn't think of me as human. So i started talking about how bad my anxiety was and how i was shaking for almost 4 days straight in hopes to hint to my dad that i need a sincere apology.

He asked me why i was anxious,and if i was taking my meds. I kinda snapped, I told him that he was making my life harder by trying to get at my mom through me and my sister, and i told him that he was failing as a father. I said that i wish my mom took me and left him my sister and separated like they originally were going to. I don't feel bad because stuff like this has been going on my whole life. AITA?

(update 3 hours after the car incident happened my dad called me downstairs to talk with him, and instead of him apologizing for being immature, he told me my sister came to his house while he was working and he didnt know she was there (for 3 and a half days), and told me i was wrong for blaming him)",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,0.0,-0.0016183679,0,1
24,1c9yi4y,AITA I refuse to go to my cousin’s baby shower,"I have a little cousin who I’ve been pretty close with our whole lives. She even lived with my parents and I while she was in college, so our bond is almost that of sisters. 

We haven’t spoke in almost two years. At that time she was in the beginning stages of a new relationship with this guy who she’d been on and off with since high school. He wasn’t always great to her and even admitted that he was embarrassed to be with her publicly due to her physical handicap. He cheated on her a lot and ended up with herpes. At one point, he didn’t even bother with the break up, just left the state and didn’t talk to her for a few years. For all of these reasons, I’m not this guy’s biggest fan, but my cousin seemed to be happy so I told her she should bring him to come hang out with me and my husband next time she’s in town. 

That was the last time we spoke outside of a “merry Christmas” “happy new year” or “happy birthday” text with no real conversation attached. I found out she married him when I saw all the pictures of their wedding on insta. I was hurt she didn’t even tell me she got engaged and that I wasn’t invited, but I assumed it was a low key affair and brushed it off and told her how beautiful she looked with no response from her.

 About 4-5 months ago, my sister told me that our cousin is pregnant, but she didn’t want too many people to know just yet so I had to pretend I didn’t know. I was again hurt that she wouldn’t tell me, but she’s an adult and given that her pregnancy would likely be a high risk one, I understand wanting to keep it private until it’s safe. 

About a month ago my mom asked my aunt (cousin’s mom) about it and was told my cousin specifically said she didn’t want my mom or I to know and asked her not to tell us. She said we’d never approved of her man and talked a lot of mess about him and she didn’t want our negativity to ruin this happy time in her life. This hurt in a big way. Sure I’d talked badly about him, but it was when I was agreeing with her all those times he’d hurt her.

I’ve never been anything but supportive towards her and I couldn’t believe she’d want to exclude me from her life like this. I managed to get over it and just unfollowed all of her socials so I didn’t need to see the life she didn’t want me to be a part of and moved on. 

A few days ago, she texted me and asked for my address so she can send a baby shower invitation, still not actually even telling me that’s married or pregnant, just that she’d like to send an invite. I told my mom about it who immediately said I should just forgive her and go. I’m absolutely not going. She’s clearly told people that doesn’t want me involved with this part of her life. I think it’s ridiculous to ask me to show up and give her money and baby items for the baby she didn’t even want me to know she’s having. AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,0.0,1.0238808,1,0
25,1c9yhn1,AITA for saying that I think my niece is autistic?,"Throw away account.
Let me start by saying I’m not an expert on autism, but I did take a couple of classes in college about working with special needs adults and children, and I have volunteered with special Olympics and YMCA for years.

I 28F have lived out of the country (US) for 2 years now. About a month before I left my niece was born. This is the first grandchild and the whole family was thrilled of course. I was in the delivery room and got to spend a month with her before I left.

I was gone for two years working before I got to come back to visit.

During my visit I got to spend 1 on 1 time with my niece. This is where I noticed some signs of autism. She’s over 2 yo and doesn’t try to speak, won’t make eye contact, won’t respond to her name, really doesn’t play with toys. More like she inspects them, or tries to figure them out.
Maybe I noticed because I don’t see her everyday.

I brought up to my bro and SIL that I think she might have autism and they need to talk to her dr. My brother took it pretty well (I think he might know deep down). But my SIL went off on me. Telling me my niece was perfect and is just developing on her own., that I didn’t have any right to say she had problems. Etc etc. My mom and dad stayed silent. My bro and SIL took my niece and left. My mom said I should have kept it to myself. My dad has always respected my education and experience and asked me why I thought so. I explained what I saw. He did some googling and now agrees with me. We both know early intervention is important for children with autism and only want what is best for her.

my SIL has now started a campaign in the family that I’m a jealous unmarried spinster, and am making up terrible things about my niece. My dad is taking up for me, my mom and brother are silent, and my SIL is on a rampage.

27,1c9y3rf,"AITA for giving one of my project partners an honest review, causing them to possibly flunk the class?","Hey all. I (23F) recently worked on a big group project for a biology class. The project was on an issue in the world, like Instagram tourism or POPs / PTEs. We had to sign up in a spreadsheet to a topic you thought sounded good enough. I ended up doing a project related to the Instagram tourism, since I found it most interesting. There were already two people signed up for it. Let’s call them Tim and Eric. They were pretty cool on doing all their work, and attended the meetings regularly. We got the ball rolling pretty early on, and we had no issues with anything.

  
Now, it was typically groups of four, but we were a group of three. There were about 32 kids in our class, so 8 projects in total, all 25 minutes in length, with an extra 5 minutes for a short Q&A section. According to our professor, the reason we were a person short is because one member of the class, let’s call him John, hadn’t been in class due to some lung issues. He had not been in since early February. However, unexpectedly, during the third week of our project, John reached out to Tim on Instagram. He asked to join in, which sort of shocked the rest of us and even the teacher.

  
Here’s where I might be in the wrong. John only met with us on the phone, claiming he was just at his apartment, sick. He did sound pretty terrible, I won’t lie. However, during one such phone call, one detail he made mention to was driving back from a show in a major city nearby. I’m no medical expert, but the fact he was out and about, hundreds of miles away, and not back in bed, just sort of stuck with me. On top of that, he didn’t submit his recorded audio files for our video presentation until last minute, forcing me to literally be arranging the video no less than one hour than the class was supposed to begin. And his audio was very “first take”, too. He also did not contribute to the slides he was reading off of- honestly, it felt more like he joined the project to save his grade.

  
I didn’t meet John in person until he showed up to presentation day. He didn’t answer any other questions, and honestly, if he hadn’t shown up, nothing would have changed. After the class had gotten done with reviews, the teacher asked us to fill out a group evaluation form. I gave Tim and Eric high marks and great comments because they actually DID something, but gave John a pretty scathing review because he didn’t do much, nor did he help on the project.

  
Today, John texted the group chat, complaining that his 67% had suddenly dropped to a MUCH lower grade because of the feedback review, saying that he might not pass this class again. As someone who’s had to repeat a class, I’d feel pretty annoyed if that happened. Am I the asshole for this?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,0.0,0.09466248,0,1

Before leaving for the park, Greg and Stan started playing catch in our front yard with a hard baseball.  Unfortunately, one of Greg’s throws hit the tip of Stan’s mitt and bounced off into our front picture window, shattering the glass.  There were no adults in the front yard supervising the incident, but the boys agree that Greg threw the ball that hit the window, and that it was an accident (not malicious).  

I spoke with Greg’s grandma (who has custody of Greg) and expected her to pay for the broken window, but she believes that Greg is “at most, half responsible” because the boys were playing together in my yard.  So, Reddit, AITA?  Should I pay for the window?

Edit: 
Geez.  Point taken—I’ll pay for (at least half) of the window.  That said, I think the situation is far more nuanced than people are making it out to be.

30,1c9xdzc,WIBTA for not letting my friend stay at my place ,"I have a good friend in a different city who met a girl on a dating app. He really wants to come to my city to meet her, and hotels are generally quite expensive where I live. He asked if he could fly over and crash at my place and told me about the girl, and also said we could also hang out since he missed me. 

I don’t want him to stay for several reasons:
- I think him coming alone would make my boyfriend uncomfortable - I told him this and he already got a mutual female friend that is down to come too. 
- My parents are coming right before his planned dates and I just need time to reset after that. 
- I’ll be busy with school and exams during his planned dates, and I’ll need to catch up after my parents leave. 
- I don’t necessarily like the idea that he is being so pushy on staying at my place just to see a girl (it sorta feels like that’s his primary reason for coming instead of just to hang out and see an old friend, and because he’s so pushy about staying despite this time not being good for me, I feel a bit used - I did not tell him this, as I don’t know how to bring it up nicely). 

I already told him I couldn’t host at the time because of school being busy. I said I’d be happy for him and my other friend to come during the summer. However, it seems he is set on coming for those specific days because of the girl. 

Technically, I also COULD host them during those days. But it’s honestly not ideal for me for the reasons I said earlier (I like being alone and not having to worry about anyone around me while I study/have exams). But by not hosting, I’m probably setting him back hundreds of dollars in hotel expenses. 

Am I a bad friend or being selfish for feeling this way? I already told him most of the reasons for not being able to host those days, but he is sort of still pushing it. I don’t want this to negatively affect our friendship, but I also don’t know what to say to him regarding this from here on out…",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,0.0,0.020807639,0,1
31,1c9xc49,AITA For refusing to pick my daughter up and instead leaving her to get lectured by her dad?,"  
My daughter Kelly’s extracurricular was hosting an event that she wanted to volunteer for. The plan was that Kelly would stay for the full weekend to do the event, she would go on a bus to the building where the extracurricular is usually hosted, then I would pick her up from there since it’s only a 20 minute drive from home.  
  
It was over five hours of driving. It took three hours to get to there plus another two hours just to sit in traffic at the car line for the event. Traffic was not nearly as bad on the return trip, luckily. My younger daughter and I were having dinner an hour away from home, when I got a call from Kelly asking to come home.  
  
Nothing bad had happened. Kelly just said she didn’t like the things they were having her do (Carrying boxes/supplies, manning the check-in booth, etc.) She knew beforehand that she would be sleeping on a cot with a bunch of kids in the same area but claimed she didn’t realize what that was actually like until now and she wanted to go home.  
  
I told Kelly no, we were already hours away. Kelly started saying it wouldn’t be as bad as if we were already home, and that the traffic probably wouldn’t be as bad as it was earlier to get near the event. I again told Kelly no, and that, frankly, her asking this was extremely inconsiderate to us and our time. There was a convention that her sister wanted to go to but had to turn down because I had no one to take her and Kelly promised this event was important to her.  
  
Kelly kept begging me to pick her up. I told her no and suggested she ask her dad David if he’s willing to drive out and pick her up. Kelly eventually did end up calling David and claims that he lectured her for the entire two hours that he was driving them home. Kelly told her grandmother, who told me that Kelly’s actions were inconsiderate, but I know Kelly and David don’t get along right now. And I should have gone to get Kelly since I was closer than I would have been at home and a two hour lecture was just excessive on David’s end.  
  
I agree David’s lecture was excessive, but Kelly could also take it away as an important lesson that when you ask other people to accommodate you for a commitment and end up breaking said commitment, people are naturally going to be upset with you. Besides, it wasn’t as if Kelly was stranded in the middle of nowhere or in a bad situation. She was perfectly safe at the event. She could have either rode out the weekend or dealt with the lecture from David.   
  
I know a typical response in this situation is usually to say my mother shouldn’t have any input because she isn’t Kelly parent. But she does help with the girls and it wouldn’t be right to say she isn’t entitled to some input considering she has stepped up and gone out of her way as a grandparent to help in that regard. I’m looking for other perspective because I’m still unsure of whether I should consider my mother’s words or apologize to Kelly. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,0.0,1.0542396,1,0

my teacher created a shared drive for everyone to create our files with our name on them and upload our work. today i got into my own file and discovered one of the subfiles was deleted. this isn't that big of a deal because it's already graded, but this isn't the first time a file disappears from the drive, i've had some classmates complaining about it since the semester started. now this is where i'm panicking because the teacher clearly stated that we had to inform this stuff immediately and if he found out who was deleting our files, he'd fail said person for the whole semester.

i think it's a little obvious right now, but when i informed my teacher about my missing files, my disabled classmate texted me on private apologizing, saying he didn't mean to delete my files and that it was an accident. i'm so nervous now because my teacher will either find out by himself or i'll have to tell him who did it. i don't want my classmate to fail the whole semester over a mistake, but idk how understanding of the situation my teacher would be.

We decided to try and make it work and remain friends while I save up and find a rental for myself (which given the Australian rental market and cost of living could be a while). Ex had never been good at chores and I made it clear to both of them I would not be cleaning up after them because I am not their maid and that they would have to pull their weight when it comes to household chores.

My housemates on the other hand, will leave dishes in the sink instead of loading them into the dishwasher, leave rubbish on the kitchen island, beer cans and wine bottles on the coffee table, and fast food wrappers on the table on the deck which have blown into the backyard.
This apparently is all my responsibility to clean and they've told me multiple times that I need to start cleaning more. I told them it's their responsibility and that I won't do it. 
This weekend I was away visiting family and when I came home all of Ms stuff had been moved out but all of his rubbish in the lounge and on the deck is still all over the place, which I know Ex isn't going to clean up but I don't think should ve my responsibility to clean up after his friend.

34,1c9wzai,AITA for wanting my aging mother to stop bothering me with her problems?,"To preface- I come from a a very dysfunctional family. I grew up watching my alcoholic father get into (mostly verbal) altercations with my undiagnosed bipolar mother over her terrible spending habits. Eventually, my mother got fired from her job for having a manic episode at work- resulting in the eventual foreclosure of the family house. Not too long after that, when I was a teenager, our family dynamic fell apart when my father died. My mother spiraled into a mental break and was unable to provide for me. In the 15 years since then she has failed to hold gain, or hold, any meaningful employment. She is in her early 60s now and has not worked since she was 49. 

To be blunt- she's spent the past 20 years of her life or so not even trying to find work, planning for retirement, or taking care of herself in the slightest. She's overweight, incapable of walking more than ten or twenty minutes at a time, and would be completely destitute if not for my wife and I literally buying a house for her last year (it's in our name). She doesn't have any friends because she's burned every bridge she's had through just plain being mean and/or a giant emotional burden on anyone who gives her time of day. Every phonecall with her is just her complaining about her life, despite the fact she is completely materially taken care of- almost solely due to my efforts, mind you. 

As she ages, her ability to process the world has declined. Her memory is going. Her emotional control is pretty much completely gone. She's scared of it all, and has no one to talk to it about. She calls me constantly to complain about her husband (also a piece of work in his own right), her medical problems, her interactions with people, and anything else she can think of- and I'm fed up with it. 

I've tried my best to be a good son, but the honest truth is that I don't want to be burdened with her problems. She's made her bed by being lazy, unproductive, toxic, and shortsighted since I was a teenager. I have sympathy for her plights, but I can't help but just keep thinking that this lonely descent into an unsatisfying end of life is wholly her own fault. I can't fix someone who has spent nearly their entire life being a myopic sloth with a mood disorder.

I've recently taken a new approach of telling her that I am not her therapist nor her parent. I don't want to be her shoulder to cry on. I would, honestly, just prefer she accept her aging gracefully and spend her remaining time enjoying the secure retirement she completely did not earn or deserve. 

So, anyways. AITA for telling my mom that I don't want to listen to her problems anymore?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,0.0,0.34262753,0,1
35,1c9wtkm,AITA if I take my daughter off the team,"My daughter is 10. This is her 3rd year playing softball. She is a great player and works her butt off. She plays any position asked, even though she has her preferences. 

Our community has an underwhelming little league softball following. So our 9u, 10u and 12u girls (ages 9-13) are playing on a team together. The coach is a local middle school teacher who asst coaches the softball team. I help assist, along with 2 other parents. 

His daughter is the pitcher. My daughter is taking pitching lessons and when I mentioned she wanting to try pitching he said “there’s no way she’ll be ready to pitch this season. It took my daughter a full two seasons before she got on the mound”. We felt this was a little unfair because lots of rec teams have new pitchers, no one is expecting perfection. (And his daughter is frequently walking players). Today he told another girl who hasn’t been pitching she could try it if it’s ok with her dad (dad is coach’s friend)

So we shrugged it off. 

He asked my daughter to play catcher. She got into it and looked forward to it.  So she was catcher for all the practices up to the first game.  First game comes and he tells the team that a girl who hasn’t even been going to practice (but is a middle schooler and his daughter’s friend) .. will be the catcher. Never lets my daughter touch the gear again. 

Again. My daughter took it and kept her chin up and didn’t complain. 

Today at practice, we both didn’t feel well. In retrospect, we should have just stayed home… but the coach insisted everyone show up because it’s our last practice before 3 upcoming games. My daughter (just turned 10) struggled with her batting today and the catcher (age 13) told her “how many fouls balls are you going to hit”. My daughter was already feeling embarrassed by her performance, in addition to us dealing with our sinus gunk, and got really upset with this. 

I approached the coach and told him they didn’t need to be shit-talking. And he replies, “it’s not shit talking. It’s a question”. To which I replied “it sure felt like shit talking”. And he said “it’s not”. I told him we weren’t feeling well and we were going home, I turned around and my daughter thanked me. And we left without another word. 

My daughter doesn’t want to play for the team anymore. She feels like the older girls/middle schoolers are being favorited… and I can’t really disagree with her. 

She’s also playing for a travel team where she feels appreciated and heard. She’s feeling like the older girls get preference. 

AITA for taking her off the rec team after this? Normally we would tough it out and use it as an experience to prove ourselves. (She is one of 4 girls on the team with actual experience). It will definitely hurt the field performance of the team and reduce the player number, which they’re already struggling to fill. 
My kid feels undervalued and struggling to find joy in it anymore. 

ETA: thank you all so much for the comments. I obviously want to protect my kid and make sure she knows her worth.. but hate our decision will disadvantage the good parts of the team. She and I have been talking a lot about it tonight I’m going to support her 100% if she decides to quit. I’m letting her take the lead and make the decision.. and we will leave our guilt of the things we cannot control behind us. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-22,0.0,1.0041237,1,0

One day my impulsive tendencies got the best of me and I OD ended up in the hospital and was in so much pain. Lucky saw the videos I’d posted on my mental health story where I posted about my struggle and she got triggered which is absolutely valid and understandable she sent me a long text saying she couldn’t see me going through all this and needed a break. Which I said that that was understandable and I hope she is okey, she removed me from snap which really hurt because I was not expecting that. 1 or 2 days later she texted me on the phone about getting a job but she still hadn’t added me back on snap and it really upset me and I felt like if I ever got in a situation like that again she’d leave and I wasn’t going to cont on her to be there for me and help me through a hard time anymore. So when she added me back on snap after a week she asked if I was mad and I said that I wasn’t because I wasn’t just hurt. Literally in that week I say in a group chat that she’s in that I’m not doing good at all and I just wanted to let everyone know that I love them and how much I appreciate them then I was naming everyone in the group and what I loved about them the most when it comes to how they help me and make me feel lucky got upset that everyone except her had something to do with that I can talk to them about absolutely everything and count on them to be there for me and she only got the I love her and that I look at her as my cousin and she makes me feel less crazy in this world I said well I can’t trust her to be there for me if I am going through some hard thing.

37,1c9wo06,AITA for traveling solo?,"The husband (41m) and I (37f) have been together since I was in hs. We had our first just after I graduated and have 6 kids together. I have been a mom and ""attached"" since I was 18. 

The husband has always had freedom in the marriage. He goes on trips, concerts, shows, etc., all the time. And so much of the time, I don't find out about it until after he's already planned and paid for it. 

I, on the other hand, have never gone on a trip solo. I almost always have a kid with me, him or my mom. And most of my travel is for a kid or business. 

So, later this year, I am going on two trips 100% on my own. I have paid for them on my own with my side jobs and businesses. 

Yes, he knew about the trips beforehand. Neither he cares too much about nor would he have fun, or be fun to be with (he has a drinking problem he refuses to acknowledge and it's not fun when I don't drink and he drinks WAY TOO MUCH, but that's an entirely different issue). 

Anyway, last night, he was dunk and I was picking him up, and he decided to get upset/offended that I'm seeing a band alone. He doesn't care for the band. He told me to take someone else. I chose to go alone. 

But now, he's decided I hate him and is being very distant/standoffish today. 

It's frustrating that this is our marriage lately, but again, another issue. 

I feel like it's just another thing as I'm going through personal development challenges and growing as a person and woman, finally finding power.

38,1c9wkyb,AITA for saying the truth about my sister?,"We were at my cousin's birthday party and there were two more of my cousins, which we'll call Charlie (celebrated person sister) and Angelina + my sister and me.
Basically, at this party the four of us stayed together basically the whole time. But my sister always has to make fun of me whenever she's out with her friends or, apparently, even our cousins. She always did this even with her friends because she wanted to look cool or something, and I could never do anything about it because she'd get offended if I did (Ex.: she made fun of my scars, I have dermatillomania, so of course this is very hurtful for me because they are literally on my face, so i can't hide them if not with lots of makeup, which she also makes fun of. I got tired of this and said something about her pimples and she started playing victim).
Point is, at one point I got absolutely fed up because she kept humiliating me like she always does. We were all together, in front of other family members, talking about our age differences because Angelina thought me and my sister had 2 years of difference when we have just 1 but almost two and some other stuff, and at one point I said to my sister, who celebrated her birthday a couple of months prior: ""she would've known if you had invited her to your birthday party."" And she threw me a look, as well as my mother, while my Charlie said I was right.
I want to say I'm absolutely not sorry for this, since also Angelina doesn't usually invite us to her birthday parties (we did meet her in restaurants with some other cousins but not us), and i am absolutely not mad at her for this because it's her birthday party and she has the right to, but my mother still complained because ""saying stuff like this isn't nice"". Point is, I feel like I just paid her back for years of being humiliated, but both her and my mom said I shouldn't have done that. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,0.06915969,0,1
39,1c9wdo1,AITA For Yelling Back At My Dad?,"I (16F) live in a very conservative household, my parents are the average African Parents(no need for an explanation there) very strict, very homophobic, you get the point. But the problem is that my dad has really bad anger issues and he’s had them for years, he yells at everyone for the littlest things and is very quick to raise his voice or threaten someone and all of my family members just deal with it For example, last week I was playing video games after school and cleaning the house since my mom was at work, and he came into my room and asked me to open the living room window. And I nicely told him “Okay just give me a second and I’ll do it.” And than he blew up saying things like “your dumb game is really more important than this? Stop being lazy and get up.” And I tried to get him to understand that this was competitive and that I’d probably get a penalty but he kept getting more aggressive and louder and louder so I just got up and did it an accepted the loss. That’s pretty much what the last 16 years of my life has looked like.
Now for the issue at hand. It was around 11:00 on a Friday and I was playing a game with my friends having a good time and laughing and my father called me and my siblings to come pray (my family is religious) and I didn’t know that we were goin to be praying or I wouldn’t of started a game (competitive) and usually when it’s just me and my mother out of politeness she usually gives us all a heads up, but he never does since he thinks his time is more valuable than ours, so now my whole family is waiting for me and I can sense that my dad is getting more & more tense because he keeps sending one of my siblings to come get me (mind you it’s been less than 5 minutes) so after the 2nd time I once again just take the loss and get up and since I have noise cancelling headphones I didn’t hear how loud he was yelling so when I got to where everyone was it shocked me. He was saying rude and hurtful things like, “you always make us wait for you do you think you’re special?”, etc. And I honestly don’t remember when I started yelling back but I did and we got into a nasty spat, leading him to call me an idiot and an imbecile and make misogynist comments and saying that I could leave when I turn 18 and that I’m not his only daughter, and instead of my family defending me they all kept telling me to just stop and shut up, so I did. And he went on and on just yelling and threatening me and saying that I’ve accomplished nothing in my life and that I’m incredibly disrespectful and not even my mother said anything about it. Currently my whole family thinks that situation was my fault and it honestly kinda hurts, I’ve never been close with my dad. He’s almost never showed up for any of my birthdays or serious events and I honestly can’t take this anymore, but I’m not sure how to feel.
Am I the asshole?

40,1c9w5tf,AITA for asking my friend to pay when we go out?,"
My(17f) best friend, “Avery” lost her dad a couple years ago. Since then, her family’s been struggling financially, so every time we’ve hung out, or gone out to eat, I pay for both of us. I don’t mind, because usually my parents will give me 20 bucks and so I’m not actually spending my money. 

A couple weeks ago was our Spring Break, and the language department organized a trip to Europe that cost ~$5000 dollars per person. 

Every time I asked Avery if she wanted to hang out over break, she’d give me an excuse. Over the past couple weeks I’ve seen everyone posting pictures of the trip and it turns out Avery went with them. 

 I feel lied to because she was not honest about why she couldn’t hang out, and hurt that she’s made me pay for everything and then spent several thousand dollars on this trip. 

I decided to be upfront because I didn’t want it to cause any lasting resentment, and I asked her about it. She got defensive, and said I had no right to shame her for how she spent her money, that it was none of my business and that she deserved to enjoy herself too. She does of course but it felt deceitful that she had me pay for everything thinking she actually couldn’t afford it when she clearly could. I asked her if she could start paying for herself when we hang out, and she responded that just because she splurged once didn’t mean she had spare money all the time. She’s upset with me and I feel hurt.

I was the only one with a cell phone today because my co-worker left hers in her car.  
  
So anyways I was at work today with my co-worker (it was just the two of us). My co-worker goes to use the restroom and comes back screaming to me ""Call 911! Call 911! Someone's overdosed in the bathroom!!"". I say to my co-worker ""Okay, hang on a second"". I walk over to my purse and grab the Narcan that I keep in there and go to the bathroom. I see the woman who is on the floor in the stall. I go into the stall and do a quick sternum rub (no response) then I administer the Narcan. Thankfully she responded very well to the Narcan and woke up, however, she was \*pissed\* (\*which I understand). She storms out of the bathroom and out of the store. Meanwhile, my co-worker is still screaming at me ""CALL 911! why are you letting her walk away ??? she needs medical attention"". I explained that 911 would have just done the same exact thing I did, only we would have had to wait on them. Also there's nothing else left to do, she already left the building.  
  
So now my co-worker is pissed off at me for not calling 911. I think she wants to report me to our manager for not calling 911 when there was a medical emergency.

43,1c9vfll,AITA for calling my sister out and leaving her behind?,"Me(33) and my sister(28) don't have the same mom. Growing up I developed an addiction and am now 9 y clean. Due to my addiction we lost contact for a couple of years. 2016 I moved for uni and in 2017 my sister did the same. To make amends I let her stay with me in my 1 room apt. We really bonded which felt great. 2018 she moved back but we stayed in touch. 

2021 I get a text from her mom saying that my sister has been drinking taking pills and she doesn't know what to do. I tell her to take her to the ER but she takes her home instead. I call my sister and she tells me she has a drinking problem since she was 14. She says she drinks 8 bottles wine a week + 4 big bottles vodka. I say I'm worried and that if she wants I can arrange for someone to meet up with her for a meeting. My sister declines and I know you can't force anyone to recover, being an addict myself. We met up and she denies everything.

2022 I'm at a house call at work with my boss. She calls me 4-5 times in a row I call her asap. She has locked herself in the bathroom at work and she's drunk and crying. I told her she needed to take help but she refused. The next day she didn't want to talk about it. That happened a few more times and I tried to motivate her to take help but she refused. I finally said I'd call social services or her mom if it happens again. She stopped calling.

Spring 2023 she gets an apartment and in August we’re going on a road trip. We spent 4h in the car and she is on edge. She's easily agitated and I give her space suspecting it's from not drinking. When we get to the cottage she throws a tantrum when I ask her for help to carry our stuff to the cabin. She screamed and I was very tired from driving so when we got inside I try to change the mood by saying like ""oh look at this, so cute!"". I got no answer, she didn't speak to me for 3 hours. I was 40 min from my home and I considered going home. I asked her if she was gonna ignore me for the entire vacation and she stat yelling. I said I'm not taking it and I'm leaving but she can come along. She refused but reconsidered and went with me to town. I dropped her where she could get a bus and sent her around 200 pounds (her part of the glamping). I sent her a text later ""Hi, I hope you have a safe night and found someplace to stay. I wish we could talk another time.” She answered no after 24h.

I've contacted her several times after this, afraid I've lost her. I felt stupid for not doing more about her alcoholism, so I called her mom. I said she called me drunk from work and that I was very worried. She brushed it off like it was all in the past. I just didn't want to be the only one knowing that she has a problem.

Before NYE my sister contacted me. She was furious for contacting her mom. She felt belittled and robbed of her integrity. She said if I don't understand this she wants nothing to do with me. I stood by what I did and our messages got ugly as I told her to stop drinking. I feel like shit. So AITA?

Needless to say, I've attended my fair share of theology classes, Catholic events, etc. However, I would definitely consider myself atheist now. 

Recently, after a few years of freedom, my mom decided it was necessary to force me into attendance again. This has often caused me to have quite an emotional reaction as I HATE going. Not just because I feel like its a waste of time, but it feels extremely condescending to hear the priest pray for/talk down on non-believers. I'm also feminist and a lesbian so you can imagine. This has caused massive fights within my family as I've tried to argue that attending church makes me feel ostracized and only pushes me further from Catholicism. However, my mom continues to argue that it's a family activity and that I need to suck it up.

This came up again this Sunday as, after a few weeks of not attending, I was woken up by my adult sister (who is also Christian) and told to get ready.

45,1c9va0v,AITA for getting upset after not being invited to my friends birthday party after I invited her to mine?,"Am i (17 y/o female) an a!!hole? 

Backstory my birthday was April 1st & I was planning on doing a big rollerskating event with 40+ people however I soon realized this would not be possible due to my work schedule, so I decided on doing an escape room with six of my closest friends. 

One of which Who we will be calling”chi” wasnt sure if he would be able to make it due to other events. It is important to add that another one of my friends that we’ll call “bry” shares the same birthday as me & he was also invited to the event so I made sure I invited our mutuals from school who i know he is close to aswell.  Anyways, I had purchased seven tickets for six of my friends and one for me totaling out to about $275 so when chi stated he may not be able to come another one of my friends who we will call”jt” Invited one of her friends who we’ll ”lala” as a replacement for chi( i tend to hold my tongue in situations like this because i dont like being mean or rude ).

I am not close to lala at all, but I did encourage her being invited to my rollerskating event since it would be a lot more people and a lot more space

Lala used to go to my school, but she was never my style. She was disrespectful always high or drunk And was getting tattoos without her parents knowing by the time she turned 15. I really was not convinced that an escape room would be her thing which is why jt was welcomed to bring her to the skating rink because it is a bigger event and i specifically chose the people i did with the intent of getting out in time not just to say we went

The day of my birthday comes around and im putting the possibility that chi may be coming so lala might have to stay home (she didn’t  even tell me hbd so i didn’t think she would care) but JT kept making up Excuses on why she should come. I told her that she may not be comfortable around a bunch of people. She does not know because the only person she knew well was JT. 

It’s now about an hour and a half before our reservation and I got good news that chi will be able to come so I tell JT that lala would have to sit this one out and do rollerskating like i planned for (since i never even invited her in the first place) because she is more of the party type and I think she would enjoy that more.
When JT shows up to the escape room, she does not look like she wants to be there and she’s giving me weird vibes. When we were done with the escape room(only an hour long). She ended up leaving my party to go see lala

JT‘s birthday is coming up and she’s having a party that she did not tell me about even though I had already purchased her gift and she told me that she was not doing anything. when I brought it up to her She told me that her “loyalty lies w/ her “sister” and she did not invite me because I disrespected her meanwhile every time I see her in school, she gives me a hug and acts like everything‘s alright AITA?

Nana (79F) has always been abusive. She isn't actually disabled, but acts like she is, expecting mom to act like a kind of personal slave, does Nana want a tea but her favorite show is playing?, she will get angry if mom doesn't rush to get her said tea, refuses to believe mom is in pain, saying she's just ""too lazy"".

Nana views mom as some sort of secondhand thing just because she never married, and was a single mom. Nana's golden child is uncle Dan (51M), and will always compare him with mom, even though he went LC with her long ago and will just send her $60.00 to ""live on"" (doesn't need it, Nana hoarded a good sum of money when grandpa passed, and is always forcing mom to buy her shit, thus spending her disability and the money I give her).

Now, there is me, I don't cook or do chores, I work at home and take care of the bills, give mom money for her stuff and do my best to spoil her. That's our arrangement. She loves cooking so I buy her whatever she needs for her recipes (delicious food that Nana will find a way to find disgusting), she will bring me coffee or snacks to my desk, will braid my hair daily, and just spoil me rotten.

My fiancee Eric (35M) knows this, at first he was shocked when he saw the amount of attention I get from mom, but slowly started to crave her food, getting used to fresh lemonade when he comes in, and overall being babied, with a smile, because she likes doing so. So when I talked about the situation to him, he suggested we took mom to live with us when we marry next year. To say m was happy is too little, she's excited to move in with us and already planning her daily routine and what she will cook for us. Eric, on his side, has decided he will also give her a similar amount of money as me, in exchange of her care.

The only one unhappy is my uncle, he has been outraged ever since I called him to let him know he has to do something about Nana as she will no longer have my mom to slave away for her, trying to change my mind because ""his wife dislikes nana, and he is not going to ruin his marriage by bringing her to live with him"". On his desperation, he asked me to meet today for breakfast, when I arrived to the place, he started berating me for being ""selfish"" and trying to ""harm his family by imposing them to care for Nana"", he also accused me of ""being lazy and treating my mom like a servant"".

47,1c9v1ha,AITA for asking my friend to stop complaining to me about money when he makes twice my salary?,"Recently, I have been struggling with a stressful job that has been playing around with my salary. This year I did not get a raise, and they even decreased my commission plan in a way that I earn 20% less. I regularly discuss this stress with a close friend of mine.

My friend makes more than I do and is in a union that is negotiating a contract. If the contract goes through, he will make $30,000 more and receive a lump sum for retroactive payment. He is stressed about the union's negotiations and keeps telling me how stressful it is, and how it's tearing him apart. 

I politely said that the stress is valid, and then asked that given my circumstances and my financial stress, we don't talk about that aspect of the job or how much more money he will make. I was vulnerable and expressed that I have a lot of anxiety and negative self-talk about how I am underachieving in life. I am happy to help him vent about colleagues, bad days, etc. In response, I was told that it was wrong of me to shut someone down and create uneven expectations. My response was that it was a difference of complaining up v. complaining down.

49,1c9v02t,AITA for saying my boyfriend isn't shredded enough to be Superman?,"My bf “Steve” and I are going to a costume party next weekend and are looking for costume ideas. Over this past weekend we had dinner with some friends and they gave us some suggestions. One friend pointed out that Steve kind of looks like Clark Kent and suggested that we go as Superman and Wonderwoman. Suddenly everyone was going around the table saying how he looks like Clark Kent. They were not wrong–Steve is tall and muscular with dark hair, blue eyes and glasses–but Steve has a belly and love handles where Superman has v-lines and washboard abs, and I feel like those are defining features of Superman.

Steve is pretty comfortable with his appearance. He used to be super shredded and he knows how much dedication it takes to be that way, but he’s decided to focus his attention on other things instead of spending every minute of every day worrying about his body. He still works out 5-6x/week and jokes about how he used to be shredded and is no longer, which is why I thought it was appropriate to say “Well Steve would have to put in some serious work in the gym if he wants to look like Superman” in a lighthearted tone. I thought everyone would laugh at me because we all know how much Steve works out, but they all looked at me stone faced.

There was immediate fallout after. People accused me of body shaming my boyfriend and told me that if I can’t appreciate how handsome he is then I should leave him for someone who can. I tried to clarify that it is a joke and that Steve makes similar jokes all the time, but they said I shouldn’t make his body the butt of my jokes, and that it’s different if he says it versus if I say it. Steve said it was fine and suggested we get going, so we paid our part of the bill and then left.

On the car ride home I apologized, asked Steve if he was okay and told him we could go as Wonderwoman and Superman if he wanted to. He said it was fine, there is no need to apologize and he thinks our friends are being overdramatic. I think he was being truthful because we had passionate \~naughty times\~ that evening and he seemed like his usual self. The next morning, however, I texted one of my friends in that group to see if we were still on for brunch, and she said she wasn’t sure if she wanted to hang out with me after what I said to Steve. Now I’m really confused because Steve, who I directed my joke at, seems fine, but I might be losing friends over what I said.

50,1c9uywy,AITA for telling a woman that she's not the type of person to attend art shows?,"I (FTM21) am graduating art school, with that, comes the usual art exhibition that my uni puts on for all graduating students to showcase our projects. You're given the opportunity to hand out invites to family and friends.

My partner, Steven (M27) works in an office that's only a short bus ride away from my uni, I usually go over and meet him in the lobby once he's done. I'm always half surprised to see him all dressed up in his corporate gear, he's an artist like me (though more in a literary sense, he writes beautiful poetry), but somebody has to pay the rent and for our son's nursery so he puts up with it.

The people Steven works with are insufferable according to him. Apparently they're all very crass and unable to hold their own original opinions, he's either ragged or completely ignored by his male coworkers. In his entire time working at the office, only one person has been even slightly friendly to him and that's Christine (F30). I've met her once or twice, she's very smothering. She thinks that her narrow world view is the only correct one, and her whole look and personality is very...love Island candidate. She's quite overbearing to Steven, she always practically begs him to walk her to the train station, she insists on them going to lunch in cafes that are awfully twee, he is apparently constantly hounded by her. Steven said that he used to spend breaks by himself in the basement of the office, until she found out about it and now he doesn't get a moment's peace.

Anyway, I was waiting for him in the lobby last week and I was very excited to give him the exhibition invite + leaflet. He's usually the first one to leave the office but with my fawning over the art show, I made us waste time in the lobby so that we were still standing there when other people started leaving. One of them being Christine who came over to say hello. She was quite dismissive of me and horribly patronising, treating me as if I was a toddler showing her my macaroni art and as if Steven was awfully kind to humor me by going along. Christine asked me if she could attend too, which I didn't really want to happen. I know that Steven doesn't like her company, and my art isn't her cup of tea - one of my projects is literally a sculpted rat baby in a gown and bonnet. I was a bit tongue tied and I said that I was surprised that she'd like to come, I would have thought her to be the type of person to attend art exhibitions. That upset her, she started telling me that I was a 'stuck up little cow,'  for making assumptions.

51,1c9uyvf,AITA for reacting poorly to my partner’s haircut?,"Throwaway for this one just cause I would like to know how to approach this situation.

My partner and I went to the salon to get our hair done. They wanted to get their hair cut a little shorter and gave the hairdresser specific instructions, cut a few inches on the top, an inch on the side. 

I finished my haircut early and turned to notice that their hairdresser had taken clippers to their head and started shaving the back of it. I assumed they wanted to try something new and didn’t question it. 

When they came out, I found that the hairdresser had actually shaved their entire head off (against their will? the hairdresser must’ve misunderstood from what i can tell) and I had a pretty bad reaction. For context, I was taken advantage of when I was younger by my mom’s boyfriend and he had the same haircut. My partner looked like a younger version of the dude. I panicked when we left the salon. 

When I calmed down, I apologized a lot to my partner. I did not want them to feel like I reacted that way because I thought they were unattractive, I just couldn’t help it in that moment. I was really scared and a lot of gross memories slipped into my brain. My partner and I have already talked about it, they said it was okay and just to be a little more empathetic because they didn’t ask for this haircut either.

53,1c9uda1,AITA for “being too good at a game” because they don’t want to get better?,"We play Super Smash Bros. a lot, me and my brother. My brother (17M) is two years older than me, yet he acts half his age. It’s ridiculous. 

My brother has had three separate stages while we played SSBU. First phase: when he loses a lot (by that I mean ~3-4 games), he throws a tantrum. This ended up breaking one of our controllers. His second phase, he would end up “banning” some of my mains. God help me if my cursor even hovered on Luigi. So, I had to improvise. I established a new main. He banned that one too.

He would still lose. I could pick any character, he could pick any character, and I would win 8 times out of 10. Why? Because he’s predictable. I’ve told him time after time again, “Bro, you’re too predictable, switch it up.” What does he do? Nothing. He continues diving toward me and getting punished for making the same mistake over and over and over again.

Now, sure, there’s a skill gap the size of the Atlanatic Ocean between us. Time after time, he’s told me again and again, “dude, you need to chill! Step down to my level!”

Which… what? You’re digging your own grave, and you want me to hop on in? No thanks! I would always respond with, “you just need to get better. There’s hundreds of professionals you can watch so you can properly play the Ice Climbers. Their skill ceiling surpasses the exosphere, you just need to watch one video!”

Would he listen? Take a wild guess (no). That’s how predictable he is in SSBU, too. So, his mistakes? Never switches it up, never improves (or wants to), and he continues remaining ignorant. “He’s the problem, not me!” Is what he’s been telling himself for *FOUR YEARS.* He hasn’t watched a SINGLE video! There’s a shit ton of Ice Climbers videos out there, I could probably go through his history and find 1 or 2 unfinished videos because his attention span rivals a baby’s.

Then again… is it my fault? While Gavin celebrates every win like it’s his birthday, when I win, I just sit there awkwardly because I feel bad that he’s not winning.

54,1c9u9j4,AITAH for posting Taylor Swift memes in a gc?,"So, I inherited friends from my partner and they have a huge group chat (20+ people) where they post memes, arrange socials, etc. .  There have been a lot of memes on the internet this weekend about Taylor swift’s new album, specifically the lyrics and the music sounding ai generated (you probs saw them if you’re here).  Because I know we have a few music people in the gc, including a singer song writer and a guy that’s in a wedding band, I posted two of the v tame Taylor swift memes I had seen on my travels with the hope of generating some intellectual conversation about it.  

It did in fact start generate a comment, which was p much along the lines of “haven’t personally listened but a few friends told me it sounds generic”.  This sparked someone in the gc to express their dislike for “all the Taylor swift slander in the gc” and asked us to keep our thoughts on it out of the gc for their sake.  Ofc this then started a full conversation about how saying “my friend said it’s all generic sounding” isn’t slander it’s just an opinion with all 20+ group members saying something both about the aforementioned and the music.  The offended person then left the gc and told their partner and mine that I was an AH for posting the memes in the first place and that I was the person slandering TS in the gc that caused their initial distress and comment.  

AITAH for posting memes?

Edit with some details on the conversation sparked by the memes.

The memes were one meme about the lyrics of one song and the second was about ai generated lyrics with a crying TS under it.  imo nothing wild and nothing disrespectful.

The conversation sparked by the memes was just the one comment mentioned above of “haven’t personally listened but a few friends told me it sounds generic” and the offended person saying they were offended.  The conversation after that was mostly about the message about being offended and the “slander”, no mention or reply to the memes at all.  

As for my participation in that conversation, I did a few thumbs ups to neutral messages about it sounding all very similar to other works of hers and I did one message reply to someone who said they liked the song she did with Florence + the Machine where I said “I also liked this song cause I’m a fan of Florence Walsh”.  Other than that I was p quiet and just observed as it was a p fast paced chat with a lot of constructive comments on the music.  No one said anything explicitly bad about the music outside of it all sounding the same in their opinion, no one said they hated it, no one was rude to the offended person.

56,1c9tym5,AITA for not walking my roommates dog?,"My roommate and I live together with my dog (Arty) and his, which is an 8 month old puppy (Nala) who requires 247 monitoring. My job is completely remote, while his is in person, so on the days he works, I agreed to watch Nala so he doesn't have to dish out extra money, paying for a dog sitter or daycare.

Since he got Nala, I have taken care of both dogs every day that he is at work and since I take Arty on walks everyday, I take Nala as well because it just seems wrong to not, since I'm walking Arty anyways.

&#x200B;

Recently, I've been having to work late so I haven't had the time to take them on an afternoon walk before the sun goes down, while my roommate has been getting home earlier.

Because he's been getting home earlier, he takes Nala on a walk and not Arty (my dog). For some reason this really really got under my skin after seeing how disappointed Arty looks every time, when he realizes he doesn't get to go on the walk. And my roommate *knows* that I always walk both dogs, so it seemed really unfair to me.

&#x200B;

Because of this I started doing the same thing and only walking Arty, my dog. Then the other day, he asked me why I, ""couldn't just take Nala with"" and I told him that he made it clear Arty was not his dog or responsibility, so Nala is not mine. His response was that I had agreed to taking care of Nala and he never agreed to taking care of Arty because he ""can't because his work schedule is so busy"" while I have much more free time before/after work.

&#x200B;

He is right, I did agree to take care of Nala and I do have more free time to do walks every day. Without me walking Nala, she only gets to go on a walk a few times a week when my roommate comes home early.

 I do feel horrible that Nala is paying the price for this disagreement, I helped raise her and care for her very much so I feel like TA. But it also feels like my roommate is taking advantage of our agreement and Arty is paying the price for that.

Hunter wanted to bring Derek and his brothers have brought girlfriends before so being supportive we said yes.

We also happen to live in rural Missouri though and I know since comming out Hunters had a bit of a rough go of it at school even being a wrestler. My parents town is also worse. We usually do fishing in the morning and then the boys go off on their own into town to do whatever and hang out.

62,1c9sa4r,WIBTA if I decline a bridesmaid role because I can’t stand the other bridesmaid?,"For what it’s worth, I’m originally from a country that is currently at war.

Recently, my friend Laura asked me to be her bridesmaid. I wanted to accept because she is one of the first friends I made in America and I love her dearly.

My problem is that her family wants her stepsister in the wedding party. I don’t get along with her stepsister, haven’t been for years. For example, she doesn’t like how I broke my “no politics or news” rule for social media to post my thoughts about what happened in my country when I didn’t for any other political issue (which has nothing to do with my blogs, which are about crafting, dolls and being an immigrant).

The other thing is that whenever we are in the same room, she always wants to grill me on what is going on in my country and the war and how I feel about (insert something horrible that happened). It makes me extremely uncomfortable. When I tell her I don’t want to talk about it, she’s called me ignorant and other nasty things.

It’s gotten to the point where the stepsister is harassing me on my personal accounts. Like, I would see a concert and she would post how I feel enjoying myself when (atrocity) is happening.

I have started to avoid places where she will be at because no matter what I do, nothing seems to stop her.

Which leads me to now. Laura wants me to be a bridesmaid. But if I accept, I’m going to be standing with the stepsister, who is a bully. I don’t want to put myself in a position where my mental health will tank.

I told Laura my concerns and she was so sad, so disappointed. And it breaks my heart because this is a huge moment for her and I’m ruining it by not being there for her.

Our friends think I should suck it up and accept the position, even at the cost of my mental health. Is it worth it? WIBTA?

65,1c9rn8s,AITA for not letting my brother drink,"My brother (30) has struggled with drinking for like 10 years now.  It’s been on and off with varying degrees of severity.  He hides it quite well: it often takes some digging to find his stash.  He’s also on medication where he shouldn’t be having much to begin with.

Just a couple months ago I went to pick some things up from my parents place (moved out earlier this year) and went to take things from under my old bed (he uses it now).  I found a massive stash of empty hard liquor bottles, and informed my parents (I didn’t want to involve myself, but I was worried for him).  This was not a surprise as this happens often where we find his stash.  No more than a week later after an initial confrontation with my parents and him, parents now buy him beer when they go out and say it’s fine if he drinks.  They even had a meeting with the psychiatrist and say it’s fine.  Which I can’t fathom.

He doesn’t do anything around the house except sleep and play video games mostly.  But everyone in the house keeps saying “he’s better now” but I’m aware of the cycle that continues, and I feel like the process of normalizing it is allowing him to devolve back into drinking again.  He’s “fine” with it now to my knowledge, but he always goes back.  And with his meds he takes it terrifies me.

So, now that I moved out, I decided to make my own mead at home.  My entire family wants to try it…including him.  But I said to my family “no I don’t want to normalize it around him” and they think I’m being completely unreasonable.  I at this point don’t want any of my family to drink it to avoid drama, but I was looking to share the hobby with them.  AITA for saying no to my brother?

66,1c9rkb3,AITA: Husband got upset after I told him he cares too much about what other people think about the way he is dressed. ,"For context, my husband usually asks me what I think when he puts on some pants or shirt and usually asks if it looks weird. If it does, I tell him. If it doesn’t, I tell him but most of the time he still just changes because he thinks it looks weird to him. 

We were getting ready to go to a brewery today to hang out and he asked if the pants looked weird with his jersey. I said no, and also told him he needs to stop overthinking about what he’s wearing because he looks fine and other people aren’t judging him that hard. I also said he needs stop caring so much about what he looks like to other people because he looks absolutely fine, his clothes don’t look or fit weird and people aren’t caring that much.

He told me I should care MORE about what people think of me. (He’s always had a problem with the way I dress. He doesn’t like if I want to wear leggings, he thinks I dress boring. I’m not the girliest of girls but this is how I’ve always been…)
He did not take what I said very well and got pretty offended I guess. Then he made a comment about my black shirt and jeans and said i looked plain, to where I responded with “I ordered some new clothes they haven’t come in yet.” And he said he doesn’t want to go any where anymore.

So here I am laying in bed with my plain clothes. I cried a little but am wondering if I should even be crying. Is what I said mean? Or is he just upset that I called him out in a way? AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,0.022507481,0,1

I got my first pay check last week and most of it has gone on nothing productive, I shamefully spent about £40 on snacks over a few weeks and saved some and bought some things and borrowed my mum some. Every time I bought a bar of chocolate or sweets or something from a bakery, I bought her something. After work if I went to the shop I always ask if she wants me to get her a treat or something. I’ve offered to pay rent, pay for subscriptions we use, pay for my phone contract and she just denies it and says that she doesn’t want my money and that I should just save for our holiday and treat myself. 

I have £10 left till Thursday (payday)  but I need new shoes and headphones so I’m saving it incase my pay check doesn’t cover it. My shoes are too big too wear and my earphones cost £20 and are broke so I wanna splash out since I never had the chance to as a kid. I had like £1.95 left minus the £10 and was really craving some cookies from the corner shop for a some which literally cost £1. So I went to the shop and asked if she wanted anything and at first she said no, then she said yeah when I was about to leave. I came back and didn’t get her a bar of chocolate that she asked for since I was gonna get her a big one and possibly some flowers when I get paid and she didn’t specify what she wanted so idk what she likes or doesn’t like. She said that it’s okay and not to worry. 

We moved on but now she’s on the phone to her friend and called me selfish and tight and that she does so much for me and that she’s gonna start charging me for basic things such as turning on the shower or having dinner (she may be joking but idk). She also said that I need to stop thinking about myself and I probably bought them just for me because I know that she hates them. I told her that I’ll make it up to her or I’ll get my shoes on and buy her a bar right now (my hairs soaking wet and it’s 9pm but you gotta do what you gotta do). 

So AITA for not buying her something or should I spend my earned money on myself? Should I have bought something there and then or am I okay?

My gfs bday party was last week and I was supposed to be there as they wanted us to do this dance together as I’ve already been welcomed into her family and we are the ‘high school sweethearts’ and things like that.

Well on the day I was getting ready to drive to her house for the party my  bsf contacted me saying her grandma died and she really needs support. I told her I was on my way to my gfs house and she said she really needed me even if I showed up for 5 mins. I said okay and arrived at her house.

Her parents were still working so me and her had the house to our selves. I mainly just hugged and cuddled with her as she cried. After a while my gf blew up my phone saying I was late and that her parents were expecting me. I told her I’ll be there shortly.

I tried to leave but my bsf kept telling me she didn’t want me to leave and that she needed support and she was in pain. I didn’t want to leave her and she did something bad to herself. So I stayed longer than I was supposed too. I put the phone on do not disturb as I didn’t want to see any messages from my gf.

It was a little later when her mom entered the house and she saw the mess her daughter was in and thanked me for staying by her side I felt proud of myself and said goodbye to her and left calling my gf. She answered the phone crying saying how her bday was ruined and why didn’t I come. 

I explained where I was at and she understood but I could tell by the sadness in her voice she was still upset about it. Anyways things haven’t really been the same after that. When we hang out she’s smiling with me and stuff but I can tell the spark isn’t there anymore.

69,1c9qrs5,AITA for wanting my friend to like me.,"I , a girl, have recently been getting almost subconcious desires for my friend, a boy who we'll call al  to fancy me. I wanna make it clear that I do not like them in that way at all and when i think about i don't want them to like me in that way either but for some reason recently i've started to react in ways that suggest my subconcious thinks otherwise.

It started a few weeks ago when i noticed i started to feel a little happy whenever al did or said something positive to or about me, i.e when he stayed a little after everyone left to talk to me for about another half an hour or defended me against a little harsh joke my other friends were making. I also noticed i would get a little sad or mardy whenever something happened that would suggest he doesn't like me in that way. 

This has then escalated the past couple weeks to where i always want him to sit next to me and get annoyed when i cant, or sad if he wont be there at an event. And then even more recently ive found myself subconciously doing things i would otherwise consider flirty like shoulder touches or really intently listening when he talks (usually i like to have at least 50% share of a conversation. All these behaviours happen without me thinking about them and i only usually realise after the fact that theyve happened.

Again i dont have feelings for him and definitley dont want to lead him on (although thankfully due to history i think theres probably about a 0% chance of that happening) and wouldn't really do any of this if i were thinking about it. I am trying to make an effort to stop all this and thought since it wasnt anything big and all mostly in my head that it didnt really matter and i definitley dont think hes picked up on any of it.

I told a friend about this and they said it wouldn't be bad if it werent for the fact that all my friends are guys ( i know i know i sound like a pickme its not in like a ""girls are too much drama"" kinda way its just what circumstances lead to) and i dont have the same thing with any of the others so ive singled him out for some reason.

my brother is 15 and has never had a job before. as most younger siblings do, he ask me for money and to buy him things a lot and i usually oblige just because i can and don’t see an issue with it. my mom however, does have a problem with it. she takes issue with me “spoiling” him and doesn’t like me giving him his every request because she feels he won’t have an urge to get a job and learn how to save money on his own when he has a sister who will give him whatever he wants. this has been a persisting issue and we’ve had conversations about it that have pretty much gone nowhere, i haven’t changed.

I also have a sister ""Dina"" (33f) who has 2 kids (7m and 12f). Our houses are literally across the road from each other. Occasionally we babysit kids for each other, however the kids have to stay at our house since my daughter is allergic to dogs and Dina has 2.

Both me and my wife were attending a work event last week and have asked Dina to babysit our daughter in advance which wasn't a problem as the kids wanted to watch some cartoons together anyway. However half way through the event I have received a call from Dina saying I need to come home now as she is leaving over what my daughter said. I was very confused so me and my wife left the event early, thinking something horrible had happened.

Upon returning my sister was furious and said she will never look after our daughter as she has an attitude. I have asked Kelly what happened and she said she just brought my sister some towels saying she can take a shower if she needs to as well as  there are some ""feminine products"" in the bathroom because ""there was an unpleasant smell coming from the auntie"". I came closer to my sister and could also smell a rather sharp unpleasant odour from her so I could understand where my daughter was coming from.

Dina demanded I punish my daughter, but I refused and said she didn't do anything wrong and me or my wife would possibly approached her in a similar way in this case. Dina called me an asshole and since then would bring her kids home not allowing them to play or talk to Kelly, which is upsetting.

She works as a test pilot at our government’s main scientific research agency (we’re not American). My girlfriend loves her job, but recently I believe she may be running into issues with it...specifically, the tiniest noises and thuds can set her off and make her scream. She’s not a military test pilot, so the job is significantly safer than if she wore the uniform. I don’t know. It’s been really interfering with our hobbies and time together, and for example, when we went out on a bike ride a few days ago, we heard a car backfire, and this really scared her. We ended up going home early, and I kind of lost my patience at her because she and I are so busy at work these days and that particular bike ride was one of the few days we’ve spent time together in the past year! After that bike ride, one of the things I told her was that I personally don’t believe she has PTSD, and that she needs to accept this whether she likes it or not.

73,1c9q4iu,AITA for dropping off a birthday card to an ex’s house?,"A bit hurt and looking for more perspectives on a recent event until I can talk about it with my therapist and some close friends.

I dated a gal 2 years ago. I ended up signing a lease right down the street from her, but things between us ended right before I moved in— I wasn’t ready for the relationship, and it ended sourly.

A year after we broke up, I left a generic birthday card wishing her well at her door and some stuff of hers I still had. 

Now 2 years after we broke up I left another birthday card, but I also included a graphic t shirt that I just thought she’d find funny and put in a note about reaching out if she’d like to catch up. My intention of this was to genuinely wish her well and open the door for either an amicable end so things aren’t on some dramatic Taylor swift ex boyfriend song type terms and closure for both of us or possibly friendship in the distant future. This was going to be the final reach out, because I didn’t want this to be a pattern and go into weird territory, but it appears that I am already there! 

She ended up returning the card to my doorstep and wrote in big sharpie all over it. “YOU MAKE ME UNCOMFY. NO! LEAVE ME ALONE. RESPECT MY BOUNDARIES DO NOT COME TO MY HOUSE EVER AGAIN”

Message received, she wants nothing to do with me and I can understand that. But does she really think I’m a creep? That’s the part that I am absolutely flabbergasted by. Maybe I wasn’t clear enough about my intentions? Maybe no matter my intentions, the action is still a man coming to a woman’s house uninvited? 

When we broke up, she talked about possibly being friends in the future if we just went no contact for a while, so boom— I lost her phone number and in two years the only contact we’ve had is that generic birthday card I left her. I’ve seen her at the grocery store a couple times and I didn’t approach because I didn’t know where we were at and didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. 

This is a very painful and valuable lesson for me about the importance of ending on amicable and clear terms, because it appears that I’ll have to live with the fact that someone I cared deeply about in the past, is uncomfortable by my actions and thinks I’m a creep!

I hope I have corrected the infraction, added a bit more info, and still welcome input.  We have never been asked to babysit (7 & 5) year old grandkids, but they had an emergency - the 7 year old has autistic behavioural issues & was dismissed from school for two days. We dropped everything to help babysit, so both parents could continue work days.

We arrived and the front door wouldn't open due to debris, and the house was in a high state of disarray; trash strewn, no clear surface, full sink of dirty dishes with no clean kitchen surface, two couches, one couch full of debris, the other with a large split seam, clothes stewn, bathroom floor littered with bathroom trash incl. fem. hygiene remnants (no bin). 

I'm on the far other end of that scale in my practices, but it's how they operate.  We've been told their home as a safe and calming place for him after school, with other kids moving around doing things, teachers giving instructions, movement outside that might catch his attention, etc. After school/work it's unwind/chill time.  Tidying/vacuuming/cleaning commotion at home is distracting & an irritation for everyone after school/work, so they do it on weekends since they both work.  What I saw on a Wednesday was not created after a ""weekend clean"".

Day 1 I tidied a bit, though I've been told in the past not to as it crosses a boundary they aren't comfortable with -- tossed trash, cleared a coffee table surface, did the dishes and cleaned a counter surface, tossed bathroom trash, and freed the front door. As a caregiver, felt I needed basic function.

Day 2 I mentioned a few safety issues, (mostly the front door emergency exit/access) and asked to organize the inaccessible playroom due to excessive toys and was told not to. I was told to just watch, entertain, or go for a walk. Unprepared to walk in a snowstorm I just sat and watched. Later we were told we wouldn't be asked to help again since we seemed so bothered and we crossed boundaries. Other family visited briefly (older generation) and one cried and the other was appalled over the home's state.

Previous deleted post commenters asked why I didn't to to the library, ice cream trip , my house (I'm an hour away) etc., but without a car seat, and a history of not staying at the table for meals/restaurants disturbing others, I don't want that issue.

I liked to spend time alone with my son, and I take him to restaurants, movies, etc, alone, like most parents do. His dad passed away, but I do have a boyfriend I could take with me but I’d prefer for it to just be us two.

She said do you plan on stopping? I said no because I think it’s cute and it’s family tradition. She said that was weird and I said she was judgmental and it was weird for her to be judging me and my family. Why can’t I call it a date?

80,1c9o0oz,AITA for confronting my family about racist statements relevant to me?,"I (19F) am Moroccan from my mother's side, and Indian from my father's side, and have a sister (23F) whom I share a mom but not a dad with. Growing up, I heard a lot of negative generalizations and statements about Indians from both my mother and sister, who felt justified in what they said just because they had met a handful of Indians who were not nice to them. A few times, insults like ""desi brat"" were even used against me specifically in times of anger, just out of pure spite. This had an impact on my self perception and identity, and I grew up to be insecure about being Indian, something I still struggle with.

Over the years, I would tell them that these racists statements make me feel hurt and out of place, and that they should simply refrain from saying them. Instead of backing down and cutting out the habit, they insisted I was ""too sensitive"" and that they did not mean anything against me. Realizing that speaking up had no effect, I decided my only choice was to laugh along with their ""jokes"" and statements. But it turns out even that would eventually not spare me of direct humiliation.

Yesterday, my sister came over for a visit. More than once (at least three or four times), she would say unsolicited rude things about Indians (ex. ""she's really pretty for an Indian""), and my mother would begin to laugh, so I would try to laugh too. In response to my evidently uncomfortable laughter, my mom would point it out, laughing ""look, she's laughing so uncomfortably! She was genuinely laughing before, but when you said \_\_, she grew uncomfortable, haha!"" This made me feel isolated among my own mother and sister. I did not feel like making a big deal out of it at the moments they happened because I did not want to ruin my sister's stay or create a bad atmosphere.

This morning, I woke up in tears because of how unlikeable I felt, remembering yesterday's recurring incidents. I decided to confront my mother and tell her how I feel. I will admit, I probably should have calmed down and started the conversation more maturely, but my mom did not respond nicely either. I explained that I did not like how she appeared to find joy in my visible discomfort, pointing out that if they are going to insist on making racist comments, they can at least leave me alone if I am trying to laugh along with them since they won't listen to me beg them to simply cut it out. Her claim was that in pointing out my discomfort, she actually aimed to make me feel more included and not isolated, which did not make any sense to me because it seemed to me like she actually found my discomfort amusing and an object of mocking. I was called ""sensitive"" once again. My dad came forward and said that while my mom and sister probably should refrain from saying things that make me uncomfortable, I still overreacted. In the end, I was just asking for a simple apology for my mom's allegedly well-intentioned laughs at my discomfort, which was denied.

81,1c9nsyn,AITA for telling a veteran his only personality trait is Vietnam?,"I’m from a small town in the middle of nowhere. Not much interesting here, but we get a lot of truckers and road-trippers passing through. 



It’s a small village so everyone knows everyone. My uncle is a combat veteran and got a TBI in Iraq. He’s pretty debilitated from it, but as a family we try and get him out of the house and doing shit that he’s able to do. The locals all know him and help us out a ton. Most Saturdays we go down to a family friend’s dinner. These guys know my family well, owners went to school with my grandpa, their kids went to school with my uncles, and their grandkids went to school with me and my siblings. 



Yesterday it was me, my mom, my sister, and my uncle. I go up to the counter, there’s some guys eating breakfast there, whatever, and I pay the bill. My guy hands me back too much change, because he always tries to veteran discount us on every meal and I insist he takes it as a tip at least. 



Dude sitting at the counter, decked out in Vietnam veteran stuff, looks over his shoulder at my family then turns to my guy behind the counter and says, “you better ID that guy.



My guy looks at him and says “He’s a regular. He’s cool.”



Vietnam shrugs and says “it’s your money if you want to loose it.”



I was mildly annoyed at this point, so I said “my uncle is a veteran.”



He looks back again, snorts, and says “that guy?”



My mom was tugging my arm telling me to just sit back down and ignore him. But I said “yeah, that guy.”



My guy behind the counter is saying “I served with him, he’s legit.”



Vietnam holds up his hands in an oops gesture and says “welfare queens will say anything for a discount, you can usually tell by lookin at em.”



So I said “well at least his only personality trait isn’t Vietnam.”



He said “you wanna run that by me again son?”



My guy broke it up and got us both calmed down, Vietnam left, but I was ready to fight that guy. My mom wanted me to stop making a scene and I feel bad letting my anger get the best of me and ruin their Saturday breakfast. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,1.0243981,1,0
82,1c9npxv,AITA for not telling my parent about my relationship?,"I (early 20sF) have been with my boyfriend (mid 20sM) for about a year. We are currently living together, having just moved in with each other about 6 months ago. We have known each other and been friends since we were kids.

Important to note for context: my parents have always been weird about me dating. All throughout high school, I was not allowed to date or even have any phone numbers of any boys. Any time I expressed interest in dating someone, even up until I was 20, I was told I could not be with them for whatever reason.

So last year, my boyfriend and I made some big steps in our relationship. I told a few other close, less judgemental and easier to approach family members about us. We had dinner a few times and things were going very well. However, at one point, one of my family members mentioned my boyfriend in conversation and my father found out. At first, he seemed happy for me because he has known my boyfriend for some time while we were just friends and said he was a good guy, but a few days later his opinion changed completely. He called me and told me that he wanted nothing to do with me or my boyfriend.

I was distraught. It was a really rough time in my life and my depression reached an all time high.

A few months later, we had a bit of a reconciliation, but there’s been an understanding that I cannot talk about my boyfriend and I cannot ever bring him over. Even to this day, despite my living with him and us being very serious, even making plans for the future, I cannot say anything related to my relationship. It’s becoming exhausting, especially because I can’t bring my boyfriend to family occasions he might be attending or I know there will be a scene.

I found out from my brother that my father is upset that he wasn’t the first one I told. I had apologized and explained I was worried to tell him given the history as mentioned above and while he originally was receptive, it’s like he’s completely disregarding that entire conversation now. I don’t know what to do, and I’ve been having a weird struggle where I feel like I don’t owe him to tell him every detail of my dating life, but I feel guilty because it has so clearly hurt him. I just want to see some other perspectives.

So, am I the asshole for not telling him first? Am I an asshole for a different reason I haven’t even considered?

  Now that I have shown you how close we are, we get into what he does that boils my blood. I have asked that he text me, instead of call, if it's not important. If you're on fire, been bitten by a rattlesnake and sucking the venom out didn't help, Jesus had returned and only you know, you know, call me? But, if it's a pointless chitchat, just text me.

 This man REFUSES to learn this behavior. He will call and, of course, I will answer and he will ask, ""Hey, who was that person that did that random thing?"" And I will grind a layer of enamel down while asking, ""You couldn't just text this?"" And will say, ""Oh, yeah, forgot...so, who was that person?"" 

  Guys, he isn't a bad guy. I swear. He is just a numbskull and it's been driving me nuts. Welp, the other day he called to ask about something to do with laundry and I rejected the call and sent a text asking, ""What's up?"" And he asked his question through text.
  I got angry that it was just a simple question and so, I sent back, ""Hubby is pissed because we were in the middle of *** when you called and you interrupted."" He apologized and swore it wouldn't happen again. (He has said this in the past) 
 Later that day he was visiting and mentioned how sorry he was to my husband. Hubby looked confused and said he didn't know what my friend was talking about.

  He became irate and said that I was wrong and I have no right, ""teaching him lessons."" He said he already said he was sorry and he wouldn't do it again.

86,1c9mfmi,AITA for telling my daughter to grow up and get her priorities straight,"
My(43f) oldest daughter(24f) and sil (23m) have 2 young children both under 3 with another on the way. 
They recently had a fire safety inspection on their rented property which resulted in the landlord giving written instructions that they would be carrying out monthly inspections due to the conditions in which they were living.

 It all came to a head last week when I finally managed to see for myself how bad things had gotten. To say I was disgusted and ashamed is an understatement. But we rolled our sleeves up and we got on with making the property as good as we could in 48 hrs before the initial return visit of the landlord. The property is still far from an acceptable standard, especially with young children living there but the landlord was satisfied with the progress that has been made and is planning to return next month. There is sill a lot to do and it's going to be heavy going but we can take it at a steadier pace now.

 So imagine my surprise when I get a message asking me to babysit tomorrow so that she can go get her nails fixed,  because she broke one of her gels whilst cleaning. I was flabbergasted,  I love my grandchildren and i enjoy looking after them when she has appointments etc but I just spent 2 days emptying filthy rubbish, building furniture,  cleaning, and making her home a safe place for them all to live in and we still have a list of jobs to be getting on with but she wants to pay a professional to redo her gels because she doesn't want to be walking around with broken nails. Apparently she made the appointment weeks ago and if she cancels with such short notice she will still have to pay so she's literally backed me into a corner so that if i don't babysit it will cost her more money.

 I lost it and told her that this is the last time i will look after her children for anything other than essential appointments and that if she wants to waste her time and money on that nonsense then she can do it when her husband is around to look after his children i explained that right now her appearance is the very bottom of my priorities and as a stay at home mum with a house in that state it shouldn't even be on her list of priorities rn. I told her she needs to grow up, get her priorities straight and start putting her kids first.

 My husband (her dad) says I went too far and that it will be my fault if we lose contact with our grandchildren. I told him that if they don't all wake up the kids will be heading into care and then none of us will have contact so please tell me AITA?


Update:

She has cancelled the nail appointment and is currently not talking to me, she is still messaging her dad though so I'm not overly concerned by that atm

I have explained to my husband that my priority is the safety of my grandchildren and whether he likes it or not I will always do what I believe to be in their best interests and whatever it takes to ensure that safety.  Even if that means reporting suspected neglect. 

He is not happy about it due to his own family history but accepts that if we do nothing then we are complicit and they deserve better than that. 

A couple of people have mentioned discussing the situation with sil family, unfortunately his parents have a very low opinion of me and my husband ( as we were young parents) and even less respect for our opinions, on the few occasions that I have tried to raise concerns with them it has not gone well and I feel it likely that any concerns I try to raise with them now will fall on deaf ears.",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,0.073673464,0,1

It was more her call than mine, but we both knew things weren’t going well for a while. So, I was sad but not surprised. We ended things amicably and said we’d still be friends, whatever that means. 

Anyway, we did the exchange of things in each other’s apartment a couple days after the break up and then didn’t talk again until two days ago when she texted me. We had been planning to go on a trip to the Canary Islands this year. The plane tickets were about $800 a piece and the AirBnb was like $1600, so we decided I’d just pay for the AirBnb and she’d pay for the flights. 

The flights were non-refundable and we’re already past the date that I’d get any meaningful refund from the AirBnb, so I decided I’d just get a friend to split the AirBnb and go anyway. 

I had been planning on telling my ex that I’d pay her for my ticket so she didn’t lose the money, but she texted me about it first. On Friday, she offered to pay me for the AirBnb minus the cost of my plane ticket, because she was still interested in going with a friend. I told her that I was actually planning on going with a friend, and I was going to pay her for my ticket and still go. 

She said OK, but I actually needed to pay her for my ticket and half of the cost of hers because she can’t use it now. Basically, she says that she agreed to buy two plane tickets under the understanding that we would both go to on the trip. And I agreed to pay for an AirBnb under the same understanding. But since that’s not happening, we should evenly share the lost costs. Since I’m still using the room and my ticket, the only lost cost is her $800 ticket. And we should each bear $400 from that. 

I told her that I didn’t think that’s fair at all. First of all, it was her idea to break up. So the reason we aren’t going is on her. Second, there’s no reason why she can’t use her ticket. She should just get an airbnb and still go with her friend. I even said I’d sit in her friend’s seat and let her friend in my seat so they can sit together. Whether or not she uses her ticket is on her, and she bears any cost of that. 

She said she didn’t want to go at the same time as me and also the good AirBnbs are taken for that time. Anyway, we went back and forth and she even threatened to cancel the tickets even though she can’t get any money back. So I said, “You know what, go ahead cancel them, get whatever refund you can. I’ll just buy my own ticket and not pay you back anything.” She said, “I’m not gonna talk to you if you’re being a dick. Let’s talk about this later when you can be mature.” 

That’s where it is right now. My friends are divided. Most say I should at least pay her for my ticket. Which I’m willing to do if she doesn’t cancel it! But some say I should pay for half of hers as well. I’m sticking firm that I won’t pay for half of her ticket, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,0.065322705,0,1

I (22f) moved into an apartment with a roommate who I met on facebook (26f) by taking over the old roommate’s (24f) lease. There was 9 months left on the lease when I took over and they had already lived there for over year together before I moved in. 

Fast forward and our lease is ending at the end of this month. My current roommate and I have decided to move out and go our separate ways. We live in a big apartment complex so they have a high standard of cleaning before management rents the apartment again. So we were informed there’s basically no avoiding the $360 cleaning fee. 

I asked if we could split the cleaning fee 3 ways between me, current roommate, and previous roomate. These two people are close friends so the current roommate was quick to say that it didn’t make sense for old roommate to pay that much because she “didn’t hang anything on the walls” and “cleaned my room before I moved in.” 

My thought was she definitely didn’t deep clean the apartment before I moved in and she lived there longer than I did. There is also some minor damage that she caused (carpet stain, nail holes but only a few). I was firm on splitting 3 ways which they were not happy about and we will definitely be ending this lease on bad terms.

91,1c9lko8,AITA for telling my friend that he should give his dog more attention? ,"My friend, ""K,"" has an adorable Aussie Shepherd named Aus, who's well-trained and well-loved. He also has another small dog named “Rex” who is best buds with Aus. 

Lately, Aus has shown mild aggression, worrying K. Despite not taking Aus to the vet yet, K discussed Aus's behavior with a vet, who mentioned a potential tumor and suggested euthanasia due to the expense. K opted against it, hoping to find a compassionate family for Aus, who could afford treatment and handle the aggression with patience and understanding.

One potential adopter returned Aus after leaving him in a hot car, triggering aggression (this guy was an ass).

Despite concerns, K adopted a new puppy, Babe, to keep Rex company once Aus is gone. Aus now stays in a cage due to his aggression (K was going to buy a muzzle to have him roam around and he still takes him on walks), while Babe now sleeps with K in his bed. 

So here’s where I wonder if I’m the AH. I sent this to K after he was fan girling over his new puppy Babe:

“I think you need to take Aus to the vet and confirm what it is that he has. If it really is a brain tumor, that sweet boy is probably in so much pain. And the aggression is just a way of him letting out pain? Idk.

 I get you’re super happy rn about Babe, it’s wonderful you saved her from the shelter, but just don’t get blind sided by the joy you’re feeling rn and the pretty puppy cuddling with you. 

Aus really needs you right now, he needs your full attention yk. I know we all process things differently and I support you doing what’s best for you. But Aus is still there. If he has that tumor, he’s in so much pain I’m sure. Maybe the vet could help you find resources to re-home him? Or maybe even the shelter you got Babe at might have some resources/connections.” 

K got so pissed off at me for saying this. He sent a long paragraph but here’s the short version :

“Dude, being happy about Babe doesn't mean I'm neglecting Aus. I've been trying to help him – contacted the vet, reached out to shelters and resources. No one wants to help, and the vet suggested putting him down due to a potential brain tumor. His aggression comes out of nowhere, not triggered by pain. I've done everything I can, but it's frustrating when you assume otherwise. I’m pretty pissed off right now. Goodnight.”

I wished him well and told him I hope everything goes the way he plans, but to take care and that I hope Aus gets a chance at a family. I unfriended him after that because I can’t stand the way he talks to me when he doesn’t hear what he wants.

92,1c9la6y,AITA for not wanting to lend my brother money?,"I (25f) have a 28 year old brother. He used to have a proper job with an amazing company a couple years back. He had a nice car and did well for himself. Unfortunately, he got himself into some credit card debt but it wasn’t a huge amount so he was able to manage it on his own.

 He met his wife at this company and they both ended up quitting that job a year later due to its toxic environment. My brother ended up losing his car too due to a crash. Shortly after, his wife got a really good job with a higher salary while my brother started a zero hours delivery job. 

They both lived at home with me, my sister and my parents. His wife started arguing with my mum so they moved out a few months after she got that really good job. They were able to manage the rent etc and everything was going well for them. Until his wife started having mental breakdowns due to the job and decided to quit. We live in the UK so she started receiving benefits instead. Benefits were nowhere near what she used to earn at her job and my brother was still at this zero hours delivery job so things became quite financially tough for them. 

At the end of the day, he is my brother and I care for him. I’m very empathetic towards my loved ones so whenever he would ask for money, I would always give it to him. He always would say that he would pay me back. He started borrowing from my dad, sister and mum. Basically, all of us. We did say move back home if you can’t afford it but I don’t think his wife wants to. 

It started off with me borrowing my brother £20 here and there where he would pay me back once he would get paid. Then he would say he can’t pay me back this time and ask for more on top of what he already owed me. This made the total of what my brother owed me build up. 

He chose to move out. He chose to quit his job. He chose to max out credit cards knowing it could affect him in the long run. It just seems like we (our family) have to pay for his mistakes now. He comes over and takes food and toiletries. We just help him out so much and he continues to take and barely gives back. I’m writing this post after reading his text today asking for money, again. I work a job which I do not enjoy. So I really appreciate every little penny I have. I wish he understood that. 

Also, when his wife gets paid and he has just been paid too, it’ll be radio silence from both of them for over a week. Then when they’ve spent all their money, he starts to visit more often and starts asking for money again. 

I really wouldn’t mind if he paid it back in a timely manner but I just feel like he is taking advantage of me now. I also end up giving him the money because I know if I don’t, he would end up asking my dad for it which I also hate!!!

94,1c9l6un,AITA For Not Trading Paddle Boards Back?,"My friend’s (T) sister (J) and I traded paddle boards over a year back. I liked that J had a bigger and wider board because I’m not the greatest with balance and length/width provides stability. J liked my board because it was smaller than hers and she is a small person so it would be easier for her to handle/maneuver. We said we could trade back if things didn’t work out so I felt ok with the arrangement.

 Everything seemed great initially, however, 4-6 months after we traded I get a text from my friend stating her sister wants to trade back. J is now saying the board is too small for her daughter and her to ride on. I’m bummed of course, but am willing to trade back despite the length of time that had passed because J and I never set an amount of time that we could say we wanted to trade back. Nothing further is said about trading the boards and nothing is set up to actually trade them back.

 Another year has passed (so 1.5 years since we traded) and J is now asking T for the board back again. I told T to give J my contact information so we can discuss the issue and set up a trade back. J texts me and says my old board isn’t inflating properly and then states she wants her old board back so her and her daughter can fit on it. I say I want to see my old board and make sure it’s in working condition before we trade back, seeing as the board was perfect when I gave it to her, she’s saying its now not inflating properly, and it’s been over 1.5 years since we initially traded. 

J got really aggressive, cursing at me, saying this is holding her old board hostage and she doesn’t need to “put on a dog and pony show” because she sent me a picture of the tip of my old board “working” on the water. This is suspicious to me because, not only did J explicitly state that the board wasn’t inflating properly now, a different picture J sent T shows the board looking deflated and creased (which wasn’t an issue when we traded or when she first said she wanted her old board back a year ago).

 I told her I don’t feel comfortable with that arrangement, I need to see my old board first. She says she lives really far away (like an hour I believe) and she just wants T to take her old board, and that she’ll give T my old board once she has her old one back. I said again that I am more than willing to trade back boards, I just want to see my old one first and make sure it holds air properly and is in working condition before we trade. She didn’t respond, with her last message saying karma will “take care of you.” I feel like I might be the asshole because I did say we could trade back if we didn’t like the boards, but I feel like the circumstances are different now.

95,1c9l4ss,AITA for reporting the apartment manager to my landlord company ,"I live in a small one bedroom apartment that’s on the older side and they do not allow pets of ANY kind. I was fine with this rule and understood why when I first moved in. Early this year my apartment complex was bought out by a management company and they still enforced the “No pets” policy, which again is understandable. 

The onsite manager just moved in, and to my surprise they have TWO small dogs. Normally I wouldn’t have been too upset because emotional/service animals are acceptable but I recently learned that neither managers dogs are emotional or service animals. He leaves them outside for majority of the day and all they do is bark nonstop for hours and hours. I got a lease renewal two days ago and I was reading the no pet policy. Tenants are not allowed any kind of pet (not even fish or reptiles) and if a pet is found in your home you are required to pay a $700 fee and will be kicked out. After reading this I was pretty frustrated with the onsite manager and lack of responsibility for his two dogs that bark all day. So I sent in a formal complaint against him.

I don’t think it’s fair at all, that paying tenants cannot have any kind of pet whatsoever but the manager is allowed to have two animals and leave them outside ALL day. 

I ended up getting some opinions from some friends and some of them think I was an asshole for reporting the manager. I personally don’t think I’m in the wrong here because in what world is it okay for the manager to have pets but no one else is allowed? 

Am I the asshole in this situation?

96,1c9knk8,WIBTA for complaining about my upstair’s neighbour’s kid?,"Last year, I moved into a ground floor flat in the outskirts of my town. I wanted to live further out due to wanting some peace and quiet after living in the town centre for so long. Sadly, I wasn’t allowed that pleasure for very long.

My upstairs neighbour is by no means the quietest person to live beneath, but it’s manageable.

On weekends, he has his kid come to visit. When I say kid, I mean a preteen/young teenage boy. I understand that his kid has autism, and I believe he is non-verbal too. I get it must be difficult for him, and I understand it is probably stressful for my neighbour at times too. But every single weekend, from morning til night, all I can hear is this kid running around upstairs (which makes my ceiling shake), accompanied by a guttural screaming and wailing. All day. I can hear it over music, TV, anything I try to drown it out with. 

It doesn’t seem like my neighbour does anything to discourage this, as if anything it’s actually been getting worse. The only intervention I’ve heard is my neighbour screeching at his kid to “shut the fuck up” occasionally, or when I hear the kid’s antics past 11pm then it’s accompanied by my neighbour shouting “go to fucking bed” at the top of his voice. 

The noise is now at the point that it’s affecting my mental health badly. It’s relentless, and I can’t focus on anything other than the sound of this kid stomping and screaming. Would I be the asshole if I asked my neighbour to do something about it?",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,0.10804516,0,1
97,1c9jrn8,AITA for wanting to use 2 carrots to make myself juice?,"My parents bought an expensive juice maker a few days ago for my father. They think drinking fresh juice will cure him of skin cancer (not the deadly kind). 

I have been helping my father with the juicer since a few days ago, helping him figure it out etc. Today, my parents decided to make carrot juice. I get up and see my mom using a dangerous grater to cut the carrots. I make a comment saying that it's dangerous and unnecessary, because she might cut her finger off for no reason. Carrots do not need to be grated into small chunks for juice.

My mom gets mad at me, starts yelling at me and basically telling my dad and I to do it ourselves. So, I end up doing just that. I start making carrot juice, and I ask if I can take two carrots to try some juice. Both of my parents start yelling at me for ""butting in"" and my mom makes a comment that my father is making it for himself (he's just making batches to freeze them for later), how I should've just kept playing on my console etc.

That shocked me. I was asking for two carrots, not a litre of juice. I felt offended that they were having such a large reaction and yelling at me over measly 2 carrots. So, I walk out of the kitchen and sit in the living room. My dad then calls me to help him pour the juice in the bags and I say no. He also left me 1 carrot to ""make myself juice"" which approximately 10 drops because they barely yield anything. I tell him that I won't help him, that I'm not making myself juice and my parents call me dramatic and petty.

98,1c9jjyw,AITA for telling another player (D&D) not to be bothered by getting interrupted.,"So ya, so this guy I play D&D with got mad because another player cut him off when he was talking.  I said everyone gets cut off, get back to the game.  



More details:

Okay, so step by step, we're playing over Discord, and one player, D, gets compelled to attack the closest ally.  That's K, so he moves, attacks, and scores like a 20+ on the attack role.  He seems excited and checks to make sure it hits; it does.  Rolls damage, gets max, like 20+ again.  That hurts but K can take it.  D then goes into his description of the attack and what he says, his character is attacking because he's magically been enraged.  We don't really hear it because App speaks up at then.  Most can't understand two people talking at once so, but the GM explains that App casts Silvery Barbs to make him re-roll.  D rerolls and misses by like 1.  



D's quiet; there's a bit of back and forth, and then K asks him what his character shouted while attacking.  That sets D off grumbling about being cut off and other stuff.  App reminds D that he, App, is at work and is busy, so he couldn't interject sooner.  D counters something like, ""Maybe App shouldn't be playing D&D while at work.""  That's when I tell him we all get cut off sometimes.  It's like a pet peeve of D's; he's always complaining about getting cut off.  D asked if something was only a problem if it bothers me personally. Then goes on to make his second attack, his character bringing up something silly from his past with K as I joke.



So AITA for telling him not to be bothered by getting interrupted.

Me: I

D: The guy I told not to get upset

99,1c9ja80,AITA for not telling my close friend about my surgery?,"I (33F) recently had surgery for something that no one previously knew about, as in it wasn’t a medical issue anyone knew I had until I told them I was going in for surgery. I told the closest people to me about it before I went in.

I didn’t tell one of my closest friends (34F) though because of her recent behaviour. We usually talk every single day about everything about our life & day on the phone & messaging but recently in the last couple of months she’s barely been replying, she’ll read my messages & not reply for days or most likely will not reply at all. Sometimes she’ll read & then a day or two later will reply just saying “lol” which obviously is odd. 

I asked her if everything was okay several times & still kept communication open on my end for her & let her know I was there for her. We live very far away from each other so I can’t visit her specially for this. She denied each time anything was wrong & said she was just busy, but I know her life is actually less busy these days as she’s scaled back on work & I can also see her doing fun stuff on social media with other friends & family (Obviously that doesn’t tell the real story of wether she is going thorough something or not though). Also if someone’s busy they don’t stop communicating with a close friend like that & never find the time to talk a little more at other times & they would acknowledge themselves that they hardly get time to talk to you at the moment & miss you.

Nevertheless whatever the reasons it does mean our relationship has changed at the moment & communication isn’t the same, well it’s almost non existent apart from my feeble ignored attempts. So when it came to my surgery I didn’t feel able to tell her something so personal, sensitive & difficult for me. 

Some time after the surgery she found out about it through someone else mentioning it (who assumed she’d already know) & messaged me really upset & offended that I didn’t tell her. I explained I didn’t feel able to tell her due to what felt like a non existent relationship with her now & after already attempting to get through to her. She denied the change in relationship & non existent communication even existed & just said she gets busy like it was all normal & is now acting like I betrayed her & caused issues in the friendship. And she’s saying something as serious as surgery should go beyond anything else & that she wants to be there for me & I didn’t give her the chance. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,0.012562687,0,1

He recently got a ""new"" old car, despite me voicing concerns about it (German make, high maintenance, expensive repairs, it's older than his previous car, etc.) He's had it for a month, now, and has spent all of his free time working on it, fixing little issues, replacing parts, etc. We have emptied our car maintenance fund, and now a major part has stopped working. A shop quoted us $1500 to fix it, which is more than what we paid for the car. He decided to try to fixing it himself. The repair didn't work and we're now $300+ in and still no drivable car. 

I'm the one who handles all of our finances - he refuses to participate because he's ""no good at it and would screw it up"". So I'm the one stressing about how we're going to afford this and how he's going to get to work every day until it's fixed. His solution will most likely be to get a credit card or a loan, which is what he has done in the past when faced with a large financial burden.

Meanwhile, my car is falling apart at the seams and we can't afford to get it fixed because we're spending all our money on his car.

101,1c9iziv,AITA for “overreacting” to my nephew’s behavior at my wedding?,"  
I (25F) got married to my husband John (25M) last week and I are both really close to our families and we invited all of our siblings, nieces, nephews etc. I enjoyed my special day, but I had some issues with how my nephew, Blaze (11M) acted. Blaze is one of my sister Jenna’s (31F) kids.  
  
Issues with Blaze’s behavior started to arise pretty quickly, Blaze was not able to sit still during the ceremony and while we were exchanging vows, I saw him tapping his foot, tapping his fingers on the chair and other fidgeting around. Blaze has always fidgeted and I asked Jenna in advance to make sure he wouldn’t, and she said she’d “do the best she could”.   
  
We also had a trivia game we found in the thrift store about babies, it was meant for baby showers but we played it at our wedding, while we aren’t expecting kids yet, we thought it would be a fun game. Blaze knows A LOT of random stuff, and he ended up winning the game. After the wedding, a few guests told me they were upset as they felt Blaze embarrassed them in front of their kids by knowing more about child development than them.   
  
My final straw was when it as time to eat, I went to see my Jenna and I saw Blaze just sitting with some family talking about his basketball team, I told him he could get up and get some food and he came back with chicken tenders, fries, coleslaw and a loaded baked potato. I asked why he didn’t get anything else and he said none of the other food looked appetizing. Blaze is a picky eater and I encouraged him to try some other foods, and he did, but he spit them out and said they were bad.  
  
I’ve been texting Jenna this past week about Blaze’s behavior at the wedding, she said she tried her best to get him to behave but it was his first wedding and to be easy on him, this is despite the fact her younger kids had no issues. I was talking to John about this and he said to let this go and told me I was “overreacting”, he said we knew Blaze was a bit odd and that if I didn’t want him acting so odd, I shouldn’t have invited him.

102,1c9ivsd,AITA for telling my parents I'll eat lunch at my friend's house for easter,"Last 2 years my friend group and I celebrated (orthodox) easter together at my friend's house. She invited us once again this year for lunch. Everyone agreed to come, so I did too, not thinking it was a big deal. I'm at uni so I live at a different place from my parents while I'm there and I come back during weekends (not this weekend though).

I called my parents to talk to them and mentioned the easter lunch. They said we had to eat lunch together as a family for easter and kinda judged my friends for not doing it too. I misremembered that we had lunch at our friend's house for the last 2 years when it was actually breakfast and dinner, so I tried to justify it by saying that that's the way we've done it for 2 years and how I'd feel bad to say no to them. 

My mom got really angry and kept saying how she doesn't care and I can eat easter lunch wherever I want and she won't even try to make a good lunch. I could tell she was upset, so I said that I'll just tell my friends I'll have lunch with my family instead. She kept saying that I don't have to have lunch with my family (in an angry tone). I tried to make the situation better, but it didn't work.

I called mom later and I could tell by her tone that she was still upset. She continued saying that I can just choose where I want to have lunch and that she doesn't care (but she clearly did care), even though I kept reassuring her that I will eat lunch with them. She said a bunch of things to make me feel bad for initially wanting to eat lunch with my friends.

I (21M) live in a shared student house with 4 other people. 

the house has 3 floors, the ground floor has the front door (obviously), my bedroom, a bathroom and the communal kitchen and living room space. 

each of the other two floors have two bedrooms and a bathroom. Everyone in all of the other bedrooms has to share a wall with someone else and they also have a bedroom directly above or below them.

I definitely have lucked out with my bedroom, on the floor directly above my room is a hallway so I dont have to worry about upstairs neighbour behaviour, there's no one below me so I can be loud and I share a wall with a bathroom that no one but me ever uses. 

the thing is tho even tho I love my bedroom, the reason why I have it is because I lost a coin toss because no one wanted to sleep on the ground floor or near the communal areas bcs they thought we'd use them a lot more/a lot more loudly than we actually do rather than just coming in and out. 

there's a lot of hostility in my house because my housemates want to take my bedroom away from me and instead want to have a competition every week and whoever does the most chores gets to sleep in the bedroom for a week, which I think is very impractical and stupid. They say its unfair I get the room in the quietest part of the house while being allowed to be as loud as I want, also basically having an en suite because it's right next door and also occasionally I have slept in the communal living room and they think it's unfair I can do that because it's so close to me. also my bedroom is the biggest bedroom in the house, it's only very marginal. 

they especially think this is unfair because they are all doing academic degrees where they have early lectures and need quiet to study and I'm doing an fine art degree where I blast music to zone out while I finish my projects. The thing about that though is the only people they are disturbing are each other and if they weren't so loud it wouldn't be a problem, I'm not disturbing them. 

I've been bribed to give up my room, been robbed of my stuff by my housemates occasionally, been both ignored and yelled at irl and in the house WhatsApp group, had my food in the communal kitchen hidden and chucked away, all in an effort to get my bedroom.

We were already 10 minutes late, and my parents are always super punctual and I didn't want to keep them waiting any longer for us.

As we approach the escalator down to our subway platform, I can hear our train approaching. So, I tell my wife that we need to catch the train, and we both hurry down the escalator, me in front of her. When we got to the bottom, I heard the subway door chimes, indicating that the doors were about to close. So, I rushed into the train at the last moment, but my wife was left on the platform of the other side.

I thought, okay, well this sucks that I made the train but my wife didn't. But it's not really a big deal because we both know exactly where we are going, and it's only 5 stops away. I will just meet her at the restaurant. (I don't get any cell service underground, so we couldn't communicate with each other)

So I arrive at the restaurant alone and greet my parents, who immediately question me about where my wife is. I told them what happened, and they didn't really seem to think much of it. But when she gets there 20 minutes later, she is all angry at me for not getting off the train at the next stop and waiting for her there, then getting on that train and continuing together. It made for a bit of an uncomfortable brunch, because we could all tell there was tension. After the brunch on our way home, she explained why she was mad and then became all short with me and pretty much gave me silence the rest of the way home.

My position is that we both knew where we were going and she knew my parents are easily irritated when I arrive late, so why would I have gotten off the train to wait for her unnecessarily?

So AITA?

Note: I am NOT from the US 

I (M25) have a friend we will call Brian. We have been friends for around 8 years now and I considered him my brother. While we always had our differences, we always stuck together.

Around 2 years ago, we worked together on a small private project (We just wanted to try our hand at developing something). He criticized almost everything I did and took the fun out of it. We got through it, but I told myself that I would never be able to work with him again.  

This has been an ongoing pattern that I noticed around a year ago now. I planned a trip to the USA to meet some friends. I met these people the exact same way I met Brian and have stayed at Brian's house multiple times. 

Brian loves to brag to me about his accomplishments and all of the plans he is making but never finishes them. 

Brian has a fiancée (Now wife) that he has been engaged to for 7 years now. I planned my trip to the USA 5 months in advance and told him about it. 

After that, he sort of changed...for the lack of a better word? He began to become manic and just jumping around from one thing to another. Constantly texting/calling about mundane things, talking about how he wants to 'put me under his wing' etc... It became a lot. 

He also magically selected a date to get married...right after I told him the date of my trip to the USA. It was actually a few days ago and congratulated him. He simply responded 'thanks' 

There are a lot of other things that he has done but this is the one that bothered me the most because my friends say that he is jealous of what I am doing and wanted me to pick him over a trip that I paid for in advance. 

I honestly have no anger about it, but I believe he does not want me to do better? He always tells me about missed opportunities and that he regrets where he is in life right now. I honestly do not think that I did anything wrong by missing the wedding and people tell me that I did the right thing. (The tickets were almost 2k) and I couldn't get a refund 

He's obviously sulking about it and I have been distancing myself as I look back on other things.

109,1c9h7tl,AITA for refusing a coworkers gift of used housewares?,"So I (30F) recently eloped with boyfriend, well now husband (39M). We purchased a home on the lake in a new subdivision and it is truly our dream home. We had closed on our house about a month prior to the elopement so we already had moved our belongings in and purchased anything else we needed and sold any other belongings that we had in each of our apartments since the leases were up or almost up. 

Once some of my coworkers found out we had eloped, they wanted to throw me a shower. I politely told them I was perfectly fine with having a little party to celebrate but no gifts. When asked why no gifts I told them honestly didn’t need anything. Typically in my area when a wedding shower or housewarming party is thrown people gift toasters or sets of dishes etc. Our home is furnished. We both have successful jobs. “No gifts or monetary gifts please. But we would love to celebrate with you. Your presence is the only gift we want.” That was basically the conversation. And it was received well. The party happened and all went well. 

Yesterday a coworker who had not came to the party randomly showed up at our home. I am not close with this person. We actually try to avoid each other most days. Anyways, she arrived at our home with 3 large black trash bags that contained used houseware items from her home. She said she “knew it was hard when you are first starting out” and thought these items could help us “while we get on our feet”. She also made a comment about how she was going to have a garage sale but would rather just give them to someone who needed them. 

I told her I really appreciated the thought but that we were settled and maybe she should take her items give them to someone who needed them because we were on our feet. She said I was just  being modest. She ended up refusing to tell me how she got my address and also refused to take her “gifts” back with her. I told her we didn’t need her items but if she wanted to leave them I would be happy to donate them for her. She said I was being rude. She did leave the bags though and I am taking them to a local consignment store that sells items and uses the money to help survivors of domestic violence. 

AITA?

UPDATE: HR was miraculously able to see me this morning. She also found the address issue concerning. I work in Healthcare and I am also a patient where I work. Everything you access within our system is logged. So when they pulled her access records it turns out my coworker had accessed my medical records 5 times within a week. It was never within her job duties to access my file. She had also accessed 2 other coworkers files. They terminated her employment on the spot. Within our company (and I would imagine most) that is grounds for immediate termination. Her sister in law is also an employee there and she had accessed my records as well. Her employment was also terminated. Now I’m wondering if I need to seek legal action or even get a restraining order? My husband donated the items this morning. He said he didn’t want them in the garage any longer than necessary. I had read him the comment about the items possibly having bugs or being bugged and now we are both paranoid.

Yesterday my sister Saw the gift and was immediately angry, I didnt understand why but as I'm autistic I miss up a lot of social cues like this so I asked her If she was angry with me and If she wanted me to not give the gift, since I also had the chocolate I wouldn't mind not giving the picture too.

 She Said no, Said she wasnt angry with me and went to her Room. Today was the birthday, I waited till she gave the gift First and then gave Mine, saying the picture frame idea was hers, she seemed Fine till we went downstairs and she started crying, I asked her what happened and when I realised It was about the picture I got really sad and confused, she was also very angry with me, I keept asking what could I do to fix it and she Just seemed to get more angry at me, I really dont understand what I did wrong, she Said It was clear that I shouldnt have brought It in the First place because when she showed me her gift she Said ""don't copy It"" but I thought she was joking since It didnt make sense for mother to have a picture Just of her, and also because she was smiling and laughing as she Said It.

113,1c9g0tz,AITA for telling my fiancé's grandparents that I don't put their actions on him?,"I (27f) have known my fiancé for 8 years now and we're getting married next year. He does not have a relationship with his mother anymore and his dad died when he was 6 years old. He had grandparents, aunts and uncles as well as cousins from his dad's side he was very close to and still is today. From his mother's side he only had grandparents that he still spoke to but he was not that close to them. During our relationship they did get closer because they validated my fiancé's bad experiences with his mom and they accepted that she did a poor job after his dad died and had really messed with my fiancé's head. 

My fiancé's mother had two additional children before he moved out of her house. She has a daughter who would be about 9 now and a son who would be 11 I think. I have never met them so I could be off by a year or two. My fiancé does not see these kids, he does not want to see them or have any contact with them. This was always something he was honest about. He never wanted to reconcile with his mother and would never be okay with anyone attempting to encourage that and he also had no interest in getting to know her children either now or in the future. I accepted that. His grandparents said they understood this.

But they were lying. After we got engaged his grandparents invited us over for dinner at their house and who was there? The kids. My fiancé was furious and the grandparents had already told them about my fiancé and the fact we were getting married. His half sister was super excited and had wanted to meet him for ages and was given the idea by the grandparents that she and her brother would be at the wedding. My fiancé demanded to speak to his grandparents and he told them they had crossed a line and could get themselves out of it because there was no way he was inviting the kids.

We left after this and his grandparents reached out multiple times to scold my fiancé and tell him he shouldn't take his issues out on the kids and he should embrace having siblings. His response was fuck biological ties and fuck the idea that he's going to accept any of his mother's additional children into his life because he doesn't care if they have a DNA connection or not.

After enough of these arguments and my fiancé blocking them they reached out to me and asked me how I could marry someone who would reject his own flesh and blood and two kids at that, one who had been so excited to meet him and be part of his life. They told me that should make me hate him to see him crush her the way he did. I told them I don't put their actions (telling the kids, bringing them to the house, setting us up) on my fiancé because he was always clear on this. They accused me of being heartless to innocent children I have no prior bad history with because I defend him. I shook it off but they really didn't like me blaming them and have since said I'm not only heartless but rude.

114,1c9fqwf,AITA For Wanting My Married-With-Kids Friend To Plan Stuff To Do When I Visit?,"It's kind of the classic story, met my best friend at university, he got married and had kids, I stayed single, but we're still friends in our late 30s. We live in different cities and usually see each other around four times a year. When he visits me I have made plans in anticipation; nothing elaborate, just a couple of places to visit for a walk, a movie at the cinema, a nice cafe or pub.

When I visit him my main activity is watching him go about his normal activities as a husband, a father, a dog-owner. There will be two or three hour stretches where he's doing other things or where I don't even know where he is so I just sit at the kitchen table on my laptop or read a book. 

When we go somewhere it's with the whole family, so most of his attention is spent looking after the kids and I basically feel like an au pair or family servant carrying the extra bags. When we get back he has to walk the dog for an hour and a half. Then it's feeding the kids, bath time, bed time, etc, so the only time we actually spend together is two hours at the end of the day when we just watch a movie in silence.

I always think that I was in his shoes I'd I ask my wife to look after the kids and dog for the weekend so I could do stuff with my friend. She often goes on city breaks with her friends and leaves everything to him so fair's fair, right? Or am I just a narcissistic single guy who doesn't realise he just doesn't want to do the cinema, cafe, gallery stuff any more now he has more important things to worry about?",Asshole,2024-04-21,1.0,1.0610157,1,1

I think about this from time to time because I feel like an awful person about it, but after realizing that the person I was in a relationship with gaslit and manipulated me and constantly tried to blackmail me, I need peace of mind and I want to know if I was the AH or if he was just trying to make me feel bad and make me seem like a bad person. 

Me and this person were together for a year or so when this happened. I moved to a new school because of personal reasons, and I never thought I would be attracted to anyone here because I had my boyfriend at the time. As the time passed, I realized I had slight feelings for another person. It wasn’t huge and I didn’t act on it as me and this person were just friends like everyone else I met. I felt bad and I thought that I should be honest with my partner and tell them, but assure them that I had no lesser feelings for them and I still loved them the same and I had no desire to act on those feelings, but I didn want to lie to his face and wanted to tell the truth. He got angry and blew up at me and told me I was basically cheating on him and how am I supposed to love him if I have a crush on someone else. I told him that I didnt WANT to have feelings for anyone else and that I couldn’t control my feelings. This was my defense the whole time because I did not CHOOSE to have feelings towards this person because that isn’t how it works. He kept asking how, and he certainly held a grudge on me about it (he used this to say that I also “cheated” on him after he cheated on me). I just want to know if I’m the AH because I want to get over this relationship but I don’t know if i was in the wrong in this specific situation.

116,1c9fakb,WIBTA for exclusing my little sister from my birthday dinner?,"I (18 F) recently had my 18th birthday. Because of upcoming exams, I didn’t really have the energy to plan/have a party, and I didn’t even tell my friends it was my birthday. I planned on having a small celebration with my family, just presents and a take-away, and then have a proper celebration after exams. Well, it came to my birthday, and my little sister (who’s 14) was being really objectionable, pushing for us to have birthday cake when I wanted to take my time opening my presents, not contributing to the conversation, always looking at the clock, etc. She didn’t even get me a present – she did give me one, but it was obviously one my mum had got on her behalf, and she confessed later that evening. I’m not on the best terms with my sister (no real reason, just teenage angst on her part) so I let it slide.  
We ordered a takeaway, and I decided to have a relaxing bath while we waited for it to come. I told my family this, got the bath supplies and went to the bathroom. By the time I got there, my sister had stolen the plug. For context, she’s got this weird thing about the bathroom, hates anyone else using it, so we clash a lot because I absolutely love long bubble baths. Because of this, I usually wait until she’s out the house to have my baths, even though that leads to having to schedule my day around her (which is really inconvenient). But I thought since it was my birthday and she hadn’t even got me anything, she’d at least let me have this. Nope. I told my parents the situation, and they asked her for the plug back, she denied taking it, and the whole thing devolved into an enormous argument. My sister refused to return the plug so in the end my mum found this random other plug that also worked. I had my bath, the takeaway arrived, I got dressed and came down. It was already super tense and awkward in there, with the argument still going on, so I asked my sister to leave because she was really bringing down the atmosphere. I said she could take her food with her to the lounge and eat it while watching a movie or something. She refused to eat in the lounge, the argument continued, and in the end we (my mum, dad and I) left the room to let her at first, and then had our (slightly cold) takeaway – really late because of all the arguing.   
We’re planning on going out for dinner to make up for the spoiled evening, and I’ve said I don’t want my sister to come. My parents have agreed and my sister hasn’t really protested. Still, I feel bad about leaving her out. I want to have a nice time with my family and her behaviour would really bring us down (especially cause I want to have sharing platters, and she always fusses and argues about getting the most, and she interrupts conversations saying how boring they are and telling us to be quiet). But I know if I was in her place I’d be devastated about being excluded like this.

117,1c9ee2c,AITA for not giving my co-worker a lift home?,"So i was leaving work the other day when a co-worker, whose name I don't even know and the only conversation(s) we've ever had were simple pleasantries and greetings, shouted at me from down the hall as I was exiting and asked me to drive her home.

For context, I sometimes offer a lift to other co-workers who I get along with AND they're commute is in the same direction that i am headed, so bringing them along adds virtually no time to my commute.

I asked her where and she said she lived in the opposite direction of where I was going and bringing her would take me a solid 20 minutes extra (normally i am home in about 15, so this would literally double my commute time).

I  told her that i wasn't willing to go there and she got upset and said she always sees me offering other people a lift, and when i explained she didn't take it too well and said that since I have a car and she doesn't that I should help her out.

I did not help her out.

So AITA for not driving her?

118,1c9e2j5,WIBTA If I tell my new roommate she needs to either pay me to watch her cat or take it to a shelter,"Around the first week of April a new roommate moved in with their cat and all was well for the first two days. After that they started asking me for about five days at a time to feed their cat. The problem has been that since the new cat and my cat are integrating she leaves her cat locked up in her room all day when she’s gone and while I take her out for a few hours I still have to prioritize my cat and her attention needs as well as my responsibilities. 
The last time they were here was Wednesday, and now they text in our group chat asking if I can feed her till next Wednesday when she gets a chance to come back. Some days she’s been not even texting us to feed the cat and I do it anyways out of not wanting to have a starving cat in my apartment. Thursday night I go out and when I get back to feed her cat I see the used litter the roommate left on the rug and it’s stinking up our hallway, I needed to put Vick’s Vaporub under my nose to clean it. Immediately after that I decide she needs to care for her cat because I can’t do it any longer. Between her cat crying at the door all days and the room smelling like literal rank shit I can’t do it anymore. So would I be the asshole if I tell them to either look after their cat, pay me for the care, or I’m taking her to a shelter? ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,0.01484806,0,1
119,1c9dru9,AITA for being extremely angry at my grand-parents,"AITA to not want to forgive my grandparents. I am sorry, English isn't my first language ! So I 25F and my boyfriend 30M had an agrement with my grand-parents to buy their house. They posses a beautiful duplex on a street where all my close family lives. It was always a dream of mine to live in their house one day. 

At Christmas 2023, we knew that their tenants were leaving in august 2024 so we talked to them about renting one of their unit, they live in the other. They were thrilled and told us they would think about it. To our surprise, they asked us if we would want to buy the duplex instead. Their plan was to build a new house next to the duplex. My grandfather is 72 years old and had is own construction company, he still does contract in the summer. They are both really healty and active.

Buying for us was ideal, we already had a house that we decided to keep and rent. We decided to wait before leasing it to be sure that my grand-parents were confortable with their decision. It was a big process with many changes along the way. The original price was 300 000$, because of the material and contruction cost augmentation they asked us 425 000 instead, which is still way below market value. It was tight for us but we did manage. The plan was for them to be our tenant for a year and they would move in their brand new house when it would be finished. At Easter, they insisted that we sign a promess to purchase, which we strongely agreed. We found a tenant quickly for our present house after that and the lease was signed. We also made it official with the rest of the family and everybody was congratulating us.

Yesterday, my grandmother called to tell me that they changed their mind, they feel like they don't have the energy anymore to build a new house, that it is too much for them, that their health was more important than all. They say we could still rent one part for 950$ all included. I am absolutely broken, sad and angry about that decision. We were so excited about all the project we would have for the house and our lives. We don't want to be tenant, we wanted to renovate and make one big house when my grandparents would move. We are currently trying to get pregnant and were so thrill to raise children in this house with all my family near. It is still possible but it will not be the same, we will always have to be careful for the noise. My grandmother told me that they want calm and quiet so they want to test if we like to be close neighbors for a year. They don't want to feel thrown out of their home. IF it was anybody else in the world, they would be obligated to sell the house anyways because of the promess to purchase that we would applied.

So am I the asshole to be very angry at them and not sure at all that I can forgive them one day. They had time to realize how hard it was and now we can't go back. I am compassionate about their health but they had to figure it out sooner in my opinion.

Thank you for your future insight.

120,1c9dqa9,AITA for telling my mother I find her more unbearable than the puppy,"I (29F) recently adopted a puppy (Menta, 9 weeks). Due to life circumstances I currently live with my mother (65F). Despite me being the sole owner and caretaker, as this is her home I had to be sure she was on board with the adoption. She ended up saying yes, and even offered to help me.

Now that the puppy is at home everything is a little bit chaos. That's to be expected from such a young puppy, but I find myself getting more stressed about my mother's reactions. She's always been an anxiety prone person (like me), but I've never seen her at this level of nervousness. I can't leave her alone with Menta without being worried about what's going on with them.

She says things like ""she's mean"", ""she's aggressive"", ""she's defiant"". The problem is my mother expects Menta to behave like a grown dog instead of like the puppy she is. Every single person we've talked to tells her that the behavior is normal.

Today, in the middle of the night, Menta was feeling unwell at seemed like she was going to throw up, so I stayed awake with her to keep an eye on her health. She ended up being okay, and sleep well the rest of the night, but I found it hard to fall back asleep.

In the morning, as usual, the puppy woke me up and I went with her to great my mother. I told her about my ""sleepless"" night, and then went to the kitchen to feed Menta and have breakfast. Everything normal. 

But when my mother emerged in the room I noticed she seemed to be off. When I asked her what was wrong she told me that she was nervous because I was unable to sleep. I told her that I did sleep, I only lost a couple of hours. And we were talking about me, I've always been a terrible sleeper, even during my childhood.

An argument ensued in which every time I said I was actually ok she'd come up with a negative retort about Menta's behavior. ""But yesterday she took too long to settle for the night"" and ""we can't pet her without her biting us"".

I was so feed up I ended telling my mother that I found her behavior more unbearable than Menta's behavior. Now she is skulking around the house and hasn't said barely anything to me

 i just summed it up to her having alot on her hands since she has a lot of mental health issues and so i allowed her to treat me how she did, and to be honest some her actions and they way she talked to me scared me a bit, making me nervous or terrified to talk to her me and Ariana’s friendship hasn’t been the same ever since she started getting into drugs and going down a wrong path, but i’ve stayed because i know how hard addiction is.

 these past 5 months way too much has happened and i felt it hasnt been fair on me at all, one day she texted me saying she was going to lend my airpods since she needed them for work (i left them at her place because i thought i could trust her with them) and when i came over 6 days later and bought them up, she said they were stolen and she couldnt do nothing about it.

 i was certainly pissed off on the inside but i stayed cool on the outside to make sure no arguments would happen, so i decided to go home. i know it was my fault for leaving my own Airpods there but i trusted her alot with my things, i did communicate to her that i did trust her with that and she wasn’t taking good care of my things, but she said i could just get a new pair for my birthday. those airpods were way out of budget for my family and i told her i couldn’t just get a new pair, she just argued with me which i eventually apologised for.

(sorry for the yapping i just thought i’d give some backstory)

A week ago Ariana texted me asking if i would wanna hang out at her place for the night for her birthday, which i happily said yes because i would never want to miss it. everything went fine and we didnt talk for the rest of the week until Friday, she randomly facetimed me and i awnsered. i was getting ready for my cousins birthday and Ariana said to me “so we have a problem..” which i immediately thought was that she was uninviting me which broke my heart a little bit, she stalled for a few moments before i just spoke out and said “i cant come?” and which she agreed. it was silent for the rest of the call until she laughed a little bit and hung up on me without saying goodbye.

My friend's sleep schedule is to go to bed at 1am, but usually falls asleep much later than this. I have a job that requires me to wake up at 7am during the week so the dog doesn't whine on these days because I'm out of bed, so she can sleep as I have got out of bed, so the dog stays quiet. However on the weekend I prefer to not set an alarm and wake up naturally, which is usually between 8am and 9am depending on how tired I am. This means that the dog is then whining for an hour, preventing my friend from sleeping. She sleeps about 4 hours on the weekend because she falls asleep late and the dig whines early. She has asked me to set an alarm on the weekend for 7.40am to wake up before he whines and for me to get out of bed so he stays quiet so she can sleep. I usually go to bed around midnight on the weekend and she wants me to go to bed earlier so I can set my alarm earlier.

123,1c9dj80,AITA for no longer wanting my distant cousin to stay at my house,"I 19 F was told by my mum last August that I’ll have to share my room and my bed with a distant cousin 21 F who is here for uni and who I had never met. She told me it would be temporary until she finds her own place and I agreed.

Two things to know about me is that I don’t like being touched by people (I don’t even show physical affection to my mum it’s just not my thing) and I like being alone after work/ going out cause I’m introverted and I need to recharge. So you can imagine sleeping with someone who does not know how to share a bed and keeps on accidentally kicking and kneeing me throughout the night, as well as sleeping till 4pm a lot of the days has been very difficult. I feel like I have to plan what I do around her schedule and I haven’t been able to sleep properly for months. 

And it’s not like she has a bad personality, she’s nice which makes it worse I think. It’s just that the way she sleeps and her lack of respect for my personal space makes it worse. An example is even when she’s awake she gets so close that when she’s on her phone she accidentally hits my head even thought there’s more than enough space for that not to happen. 

My room no longer feels like my room and I have nowhere to unwind and chill, my mum no longer refers it to my room but “our” room which ticks me off. She told me it would be temporary but with the way her and my mum speaks I think she’s planning on staying here until she graduates.

This is like my own personal hell. I’m trying to confront my mum about this but she keeps dodging the question. But I’m planning on speaking to her and explaining that this was not what I agreed too and me and the girl are not compatible.

The problem is that where I live has a housing crisis and people can’t afford to live, I feel like if I say that I can’t share my bed that I’ll be forcing her and her mom to spend so much as she doesn’t have to pay rent here. I feel like an AH but I just want to go back to having my own space. ",Not the A-hole,2024-04-21,0.0,-0.0029647157,0,1
124,1c9dber,AITA for not wanting to share the legacy of my Family?,"

Throwaway A/c 

My(17m) Grandfather passed away three weeks ago but it was not a surprise by any means. Since my Father is an only child(49m), inheritance was not much of an issue except the ancestral jewellery. In our culture, Gold has a lot of sentimental value. It is usually passed down from a mother to daughter or a grandmother to granddaughter.(The literal word for such inheritances in my culture is female's treasure.)

Unfortunately, My great-grandmother did not have a daughter or a granddaughter or a great-granddaughter and thus, after her demise, the gold was passed down to my grandfather. 

Now my Step-Mother(47f) believes that the gold should be passed down to her daughter Anne(21f). My father is a people pleaser and is one of the purest souls that have ever come to be. He has made sure to make feel Anne included in our family and tried to be her Father. But Anne is an a-hole. She is rude, obnoxious and a pain in the ass. She never gave my father the love and respect that he deserves.

My Grandparents tried to include her a few times but due to her immensely delightful nature, started to ignore her. They hated her for treating my father the way she did.

I had a talk with my father about this and he reprimanded me saying that Anne is my sister. I said that the jewellery now belongs to him and after which will be passed down to me or I will be well within my rights to file a case due to it being ancestral property.

Here Is why I might be the asshole:- He then told all of this to his wife and Anne and they were enraged. They attacked me together with their logicless points and at one time told me that I had no right upon the jewellery since ""men can't inherit Jewellery."" I then told them that by that logic, I will have a complete right over Anne's maternal grandparents' assets since ""Girls can't inherit property.""
I was called a sexist and greedy pig and they duly stormed off my dorm.
Now my extended family told me that they are busy speaking Ill of me to our family and friends.

TL;DR: my stepsister wanted my grandfather's gold and I told her to fu*k off.

125,1c9d57l,AITA for visiting my grandparents that live beneath us,"BGI: There is currently a lot of stress in my (16) family: my father (43) wants a divorce, my mother (44) doesn't and it seems that the three of us are depressed (I'm in diagnosis, my father has a therapist, idk for sure if he's diagnosed or not and my mother has neither but says so). It seems like they take everything as a personal attack on them.

Situation: Yesterday my grandmother (fathers  
mother) invited me for breakfast today, which isn't normally a problem, since  
they live beneath us. An hour or so later my mother (who doesn't like my  
grandparents because she thinks they are with my father to throw her out of the  
house) tells me, that she wants to make an extensive breakfast. So, I tell her,  
that I'm going to eat with my grandparents.

She is angry, she tells me how disrespectful it  
is from my grandmother to ask me and not her, if I can come for breakfast  
(remember, I'm 16), how everyone is against her and wants to throw her on the  
street. She asks if we can't even have breakfast once a week together, since we  
stand up at different times on workdays. She says, that I'm her child and that  
she should know where I am, which isn't wrong, but she would have known where I  
was. 

I told her, that I was old enough to decide for  
myself when I want to visit my grandparents.

She told me how sad it makes her, that I would  
go to my grandparents, how hurt she felt. I don’t even know, if I can trust her  
statement, since she changed a lot after my father wanted the divorce.

I don’t know if she genuinely wanted to tell me  
how she felt, or if she wanted to guilttrip me into not going.

In the end, I told her, that I am in no condition to handle her feelings as well.

126,1c9c3ua,AITA for asking my cousin brother to not give anymore alcohol to his wife?,"I (F24) met my cousin V (M30) and his wife J (F22) recently for a cousin T’s wedding. Usually weddings in my culture proceed for a month, so usually family and friends get atleast 7-10 days to warm up to each other. When I threw the bachelorette party for my cousin, I came to find out that it was J’s first time drinking, like ever. She was more controlled that day, had about 2 cocktails and that’s it.

Fast forward to all of us bonding really well and getting alcohol to drink by ourselves. We were at a rooftop of the residence, and y hey got mainly hard brandy and we mixed coke with it. I’m someone who has a little more experience than J and T, and I’m also overweight so my tolerance for alcohol is much higher. V already was half high from downing 1/2 ltr of brandy and smoking tons, and J was kinda begging me to share my drink. I gave her just enough to feel the buzz, but I strictly said no more after that since I knew I wouldn’t be able to run after her if she got drunk. 

Mind you J was already getting quite drunk, she was walking but not straight. Hence I asked V to be carefulin giving drinks for her, as he wasn’t really paying attention to her anyway. V was making drinks for everyone including me, and when he passed me a drink J became pissed and yelled “if you’re making drinks you must share it with me too, why are you choosing her over me and never listen to me”. They ended up arguing the whole night. 

Her statement got me off guard, I just didn’t want things to become unsafe for her especially since her tolerance is really low, I was drunk and so was V, and we were on the roof.

AITA here? Though my intentions were pure, maybe it wasn’t my business who got too drunk? Idk. ",Asshole,2024-04-21,1.0,1.0402725,1,1

This has been stressful but I finally finished last month. When my girlfriend graduated university last year I took her out to a restaurant I knew she liked and then for drinks after. I also got her some flowers, a card, a bottle of wine and some chocolates as a surprise to congratulate her on graduating.

  
After getting my final result and confirming I had passed I went and told my gf that I was finally qualified. She said well done and that she was proud of me but nothing else. I thought she might have a surprise or something planned for later so I didn't say anything straight away. Since it was the middle of the week I thought I'd wait until the weekend to see if she does anything.

  
The weekend came and nothing was planned. I jokingly asked where she's taking me for me finally qualifying then. She said we could go for drinks if I want but that I'd have to pay for my own. She could see I was disappointed so asked what was wrong so I pointed out everything I did for her for her graduation and then she couldn't do a single thing for me for mine.

  
I pointed out it didn't even need to be expensive, just a card, some wine etc or my favourite food/drink would have been enough but she couldn't even do that. She said I was being unfair and that she shouldn't be expected to have to do it but I just pointed out that you should want to do something nice when the person you're with is celebrating something.

129,1c9bwkh,AITA: Greened out in public ruined the hangout,"Gonna try to keep this short and straight sorry if I mess up. I was out with some friends I don’t really know extremely well. We were going to go out to eat and bar hop, we stopped at a coffee shop to just hangout and talk. One of my friends best friend (the first time ever meeting her) forgot her licenses at home and was super upset, told us that she’d need to go get it but we were all fine going with her to pick it up. I remember telling her “if this is the worst thing you this is fine haha”. She laughed and we went back forty minutes to get her license. While we were at the house I decided to eat half a lil gummie since it was a special occasion/I haven’t smoked in a WHILE. 

We pull up to the restaurant and as we were going in I took the other half. Stupidly. After thirty minutes it HIT. I was extremely cold, shaky and felt the world in slow mo. I’m a pretty seasoned partaker but this had me knocked and was my first time in a public place let alone a crowded restaurant. Sat in the bathroom truly just falling thru Dante’s inferno, I text my friend (the one who drove us over and whose best friend forgot her wallet. 

She helped me and let me go chill in her car. She smoked a lot in the past and explained that I just need to keep reminding myself that it will end and to try to eat cause it seems like my blood sugar was low and all that. She let me hangout in her car while I fought the consequences of my actions. I sat there for i think another twenty minutes which moved so slowly I could feel the seconds physically pass.

I regretted my choices in every moment. They comeback out and my friend (the driver) asked how I was feeling and I apologized profusely that I need to go home, I was so high that I had to move my legs every few seconds or they’d start twitching uncontrollably. I asked if they could shut the door, the light was giving me a headache. She shut they door and I heard the three of them talk.

The girl who originally forgot her wallet said “I drove here five hours away to take some girl home when I came here to hangout with my best friend??!?” then I stopped listening cause ouch. The third friend (the one who I haven’t mentioned yet) drove me home and dropped me off. I cried on the way home cause I feel so bad that I ruined everyone’s night. It’s not that I wanted to feel utter torture, I just messed u. The girl who complained has never smoked before so I don’t think she understands what that feels like. I was nauseous for a solid hour and shook/full body twitches for two hours. I feel really bad and was honestly really excited to hangout with everyone. Am I the asshole?

130,1c9bv2n,AITA for asking my brother to leave me alone for a while,"I (22F) have a brother (27M) who lives abroad. Both of us have a commerce and finance background. None of us are particularly tech savvy. My brother gave his US model laptop to me for studying which isn't available in my country. The laptop unexpectedly shut down a couple days ago and wouldn't turn on or charge. I have a very important set of exams in 10 days. So after trying to revive the laptop for a couple of hours, I just made alternate arrangements to study (ex: my phone, a very old laptop). I tried all the things you can possibly do by yourself to revive the laptop except for actually opening it up, by looking at troubleshooting FAQs and reddit.
My mum helped by asking my cousin who's in cyber security and built his own computer from scratch about it and he also said that I did whatever I could do on my own and to wait and see for a couple of days. He said that if it doesn't work out, he'll help with taking it to the repair place to make sure they don't rip us off as we are clueless. 

So now comes the issue: I initially texted my brother about the issue and asked him stuff related to charger and issues he might've had while he was using it. He told me to wait and see and then call him to see what can be done further. Now, according to me I didn't finish waiting for the laptop to charge from being dead as sometimes laptops take days to turn on, hence I didn't call him or text him about it. Frankly, I also forgot about it because I was studying for the exams.
My brother now called my mum and told her that she isn't making arrangements for me to study comfortably and that she raised me to be stingy and adjust for things and that I don't feel comfortable talking on the phone to ask him for help but would ask my cousin instead. 

I told my brother that I don't want to get involved with bringing the laptop in for service when I barely have enough time before exams to study and I'd already made other arrangements. I also told him that I can't keep changing laptops because I already transferred the files to that old laptop to use temporarily. 

He's now angry at my mum for asking my cousin about helping with the laptop when he's there and with me for not depending on him to take care of things when he was the one who told my mum when she told him about this laptop issue that I need to be responsible and arrive at solutions myself instead of depending on others. It's honestly very unnerving for me and giving me a whiplash.

131,1c9bs66,"WIBTA If I ""snitched"" on my friend?","I (14F) and my friend (13F), lets call her Julia are going through a rough patch. It's nothing bad, but to me if feels like we haven't been talking outside of school. Recently, one of my friends (14F), Sarah (fake name) told me about how she felt about her and Julia's relationship. She told me how Julia would basically vent on Sarah whenever she got mad at her. She said there was nothing wrong with venting, as she also has anxitey, but it was the fact that she would use it as an excuse to verbally attack and bully her that was wrong. (sorry about the poor grammar there)

One day, Sarah and I were talking about Julia, nothing bad just thinking on why she would stop communicating outside of school. Sarah mentions that one of our friends told her that Julia use to fatshame/bodyshame her. I felt so bad because I know the struggles that Sarah's been going through. She told me how she can't lose weight quickly and how people in our school cat-call her.

Here's the problem: I know about the things Julia said. Julia and I would be texting in and she would bring up Sarah and how she ""brainwashed out friends"" into thing that she was nice. Here's the argument starter: Julia has a boyfriend.

One thing about Julia, she has trust issuse. She would always and I mean ALWAYS ask if anyone was talking bad about her or even mentioned her name. I always reassured that nobody said anything. Sarah brough up the fact that Julia wan't ready for a reltationship and that nothing was personal. This obviously made Julia upset and later that day she bombded me with paragraphs about Sarah and she mentioned her weight.

WIBTA if I told Sarah about this, risking my 9 year friendship with Julia? I know i should tell Sarah, but Julia will get other people involved (friends, family, heck, even the school). I was thinking that I would indirectly tell Sarah that she and Julia should talk about the statment (that Julia was bodyshaming her) and just hope that they would make up. What do I do?

132,1c9b42d,WIBTA for not telling my in laws?,"I want to clarify before anyone even comments, that I’m asking for judgement about not including my in laws in what’s supposed to be a very personal experience for me and my husband.

My husband (22M) and I (23F) are expecting a baby girl this month, my estimated due date is the 25th.

Throughout my entire pregnancy, my husband’s parents have been very overbearing and unhelpful in the things that really matter. It was like pulling teeth making sure I got to my prenatal appointments on time when my husband was away at training for 2 weeks at a time and unable to take me himself. They also haven’t helped us get the things we need, like a crib and crib mattress that my friend, my mom and her sister ended up helping us get, or in general being supportive.

I’m not going to get into how they try to squeeze us for more money than what we agreed upon for renting a bedroom from them: that’s a whole ‘nother can of worms.

FIL is a former EMT/Medic/Firefighter, and my MIL had three sons, of whom my husband is the youngest. With this in mind, they tend to tell me exactly how they think my pregnancy is going to go, what labor and delivery is going to be like for me personally, postpartum recovery, infant care, etc. While I have been labeled as high risk due to a few factors including Gestational Diabetes, my pregnancy has not gone the way most “average” pregnancies go. I have expressed that while I appreciate their advice, it has not generally been applicable to me. This doesn’t stop them, though.

MIL seems to just be waiting, ready to “spring into action” for when I go into labor, and with how unbearable, opinionated, and in-my-personal-space she likes to get, I stress out thinking about it.

This Wednesday, I had an appointment where my midwife agreed with me about the risks of going past my due date, so we scheduled an induction at the hospital, early in the morning on the 24th (7:30 AM check-in time). I don’t want to talk to my in laws about it at all. The few times I mentioned possibly scheduling one before, I got “it’s better if you let it happen naturally” and “Going past your due date is normal, the baby will be fine,” etc from both of them.

I also do not want them constantly texting us asking for updates: is baby here yet, how are you doing, etc. While I have expressed that they can meet the baby when we come home because I don’t see the point in having them visit when we already live with them, I wouldn’t put it past my MIL to decide she’s going to come try to visit anyways and drag FIL along.

I am wondering, based on all of this, if I would be in the wrong for not telling my in laws about my induction date and/or birth of our daughter until after it has already happened?

I recently had a situation that has been bugging me for months. My bf took up pottery and got really into it, and exceptionally good within a couple months. He ended up doing three 6-8 week courses of wheel pottery which ended up costing close to 1000$ and 30 hours of his time.

We bought my friend one of his handmade creations for her birthday and she loved it so much she approached my bf to ask if he would make her some stuff for Christmas gifts for her family and in-laws. My bf and I were about to leave the country for 6 months of travel and he happily agreed to make her some stuff. She said she would be happy to pay. Now I think it’s important to note this friend makes 150$ an hour and doesn’t have kids or a mortgage. Maybe I am the asshole because it was my bfs bad for saying “pay me what you think is fair” but he was thinking it was tacky to ask for a fixed price because she asked for a lot of pieces.

A couple weeks later my bf drops off a huge box of handmade pottery at her house and she is raving about it. It was over 20 pieces total. Weeks later she kept saying she was meaning to pay him and I guess we were thinking she would pay 100$ or so. Finally on our last day before we leave the country she offers to pay for our Uber to the airport to pay for the pottery for all her friends and family. The uber cost 30$.

So I (28m) use my mom’s Netflix account. With the whole new crackdown on password sharing, she’s paying the $8 more a month as I live in a different state. She happens to use my HBO (now Max), Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney Plus. It wasn’t an arrangement or anything we had, I was paying for the subscriptions for myself anyways and I didn’t see any harm in letting her use my accounts too. I still don’t. About a week ago, she texted me saying that she was cutting me off the Netflix because she thought it was too expensive. Now, for those who may not know, Netflix is absolutely the most expensive streaming service, but she’s not cancelling the subscription for herself, just the extra $8 to have me on. I didn’t tell her at the time, but it bothered me.

My issue is, obviously, she’s still going to be using all of my subscriptions, which combined saves her far more than the amount she saves while cutting me off. She’s also not doing it because money is tight, my mom’s about to go on her third out of country vacation this year alone, and spends hundreds to thousands on her hobbies. I’m by no means throwing shade at her for all that, it’s her money and she can spend it how she likes. I’m only bringing it up here to assert that her choice to cut me off the Netflix subscription was not a financial one, it’s just on the principle that it’s expensive.

I’m a little worried that if I bring this up, I could be an AH because I’m essentially asking someone to spend money on me, but at the same time I’m also saving them money. And frankly I’m not going to withhold or threaten to withhold the subscriptions I pay for from her, but I’m worried pointing out that i provide these subscriptions could be scummy. She can also very easily feel “attacked,” even if that’s not the intention.

So I 19(F) am having to share my room with my 26(F) sister. So let me give you some background information. Me and my family( mom, dad, brother, sister and I ) all moved to a new state a few years back in order to get away from my other family members because they had always taken advantage of my parents' kindness by overstaying when they needed places to crash for a bit. Well we had gotten a 4 bedroom house, one bedroom for each of us and this was the first time I had gotten my own room. Since growing up there was always other faimly members staying at my parents house. 

Well a year ago my sister had moved out at 25 and now her room was given to my grandmother who has just recently moved in with us due to her age. Now everything is going well and I'm going to go to college but imagine my surprise when I find out that my Aunt (43 F) is moving from our home state to where we are now and that she would be living with us. Now I wasn't that upset as I was going off to college( the college is close enough that I come home on some of the weekends) so they gave my room to my Aunt, who said she wasn't going to be staying at our house for long, while I will be away at college for the 2 semesters. 

 Well that was at the beginning of August and she still hasn't moved out yet and it seems like she has no plans of wanting to move out. With college ending I was hoping to get my room back. My sister 26(f) also decided to move back In with my parents so she could save money.  So now there are 7 people trying to live in a 4 bedroom house. So my parents were trying to figure something out and they landed on the idea that me and my sister were going to share a room( we would have bunkbeds according to my parents) my Aunt was going to have the loft made Into her own room. So when I heard this I visibly got upset since I was hoping to have my own room. 

 Here is where I maybe the asshole I told my parents why can't my Aunt move out I mean she has a good paying job and I mentioned the fact that she is an adult. I said that my sister should get the loft so we all get our own rooms. Well my mom told me off saying that I should alway welcome faimly with open arms and that my Aunt should be able to stay with us. Now I'm not saying that we should kick her out with no warning but I am just upset that I am having to sacrifice my own space, while she gets her own.

She studied comp sci at university even though I warned her that tech careers were a bubble waiting to burst just like in the early 2000s. I advised her to use her math skills to do something useful like actuarial science and work in finance or insurance. 

I am not too disappointed about that as ultimately it is her career and it made her happy. But then she went on to do a masters as well and took on more debt to do so even though everyone told her it was useless.

Then she quit a nice stable job and went to a flashy job in the Bay Area for a major tech company (more on this later).

She then just last year bought a 1 bed apartment and put all her savings into it after she had only just paid off student loans and got a mortgage. I had told her to find herself a man before doing this so that they have a dual income safety net but she wants to make it alone as refuses to even consider it and says her dog is enough.

Literally days after she moved to her new place, she got laid off and since then  she refused to take on simpler jobs and instead only did Uber and Doordash which did not cover her expenses.  I told her to take  on other work, cashier, waitress, cleaner etc but she refused due to her ego. Her excuse was needing time to practice for interviews. How does one even do that? Most interviews I have taken and conducted usually are just about talking through one's experience and leadership skills and verification of certs. She has not found a job since and claims that if she does something else it will be harder to get back in tech.

She called me begging and asked to either borrow money or let her sell her place and come back to live with me. I have not yet answered her but I have been contemplating refusing since I feel she brought this on herself. It is not just her decisions, after she left she has insinuated that we liked her less because she was adopted and she had to do more chores than our son. While she did do more, she did so voluntarily at the time and it was hardly anything out of the ordinary. At the same time if I refuse, she might weaponize that as our son still lives with us although he is younger and has always followed our advice. 

  
WIBTA if I refused especially considering her attitude after she left? She claims she has nowhere but she had many friends that will likely let her couch surf. I have the ability to lend money but not sure she deserves it.
